      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>My party has a difficulty with the Order of Business this morning. What was, in effect, a supplementary budget costing £125 million was announced yesterday outside the House. We cannot agree the Order of Business until we get a commitment from the Tánaiste that the Minister will come in here, make his announcements in the House in the normal way, and allow for some debate on the new proposals he has made. The figure of £125 million is bigger than some budgets we have had in recent memory in their totality. It is not just a minor amendment to what was announced last week. We need the Minister in the House. We need a statement. We need an explanation. The principal policies underpinning the budget were to increase the labour force. The effect of this is to make it more difficult&mdash;</P>

It is unthinkable that we leave the Dáil this weekend without a further discussion on an issue about which the country is talking.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is correct in saying that the question of who speaks during the debate does not arise on the Order of Business. However, the Minister has presented his budget and it would not be in accordance with the normal rules of the House for him to come back into the House during the middle of the debate. That would present a procedural problem. I wonder whether the Opposition parties are agreeable to the Minister coming into the House when the budget debate resumes next week. The Fine Gael Party would not have any objection to that. Will the Minister come into the House and put the new budgetary provisions and any further changes he proposes to make on the record of the House prior to the debate resuming?</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill and Social Welfare Bill will come before the House next year. When Deputy Rabbitte's party was in Government, it taxed people at £71 per week and did not introduce a minimum wage. Deputy Rabbitte is a fine one to talk about the low paid.</P>

      <P>The Government proposes to guillotine the Report Stage debate on No. 43, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, by 1.30 p.m. The Bill excludes the victims of physical abuse from seeking compensation and it unfortunately excludes a large number of people who have given evidence on the State's behalf in criminal proceedings. A large number of convictions have been obtained as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be amendments, but none of them are Government amendments. The Government is seeking to deny those who have come forward on behalf of the State to give evidence against the perpetrators of abuse and hundreds of people are now in jail as a result. However, many of these witnesses are excluded by this Bill from seeking civil compensation. It is not appropriate that we guillotine debate on this Bill at 1.30 p.m. Will the Tánaiste agree to an unlimited period for Report Stage; by its nature Report Stage does not take that long, as people cannot speak more than once, but a Bill as important as this should not be guillotined. The Government is denying basic rights to a large number of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I published this Bill initially and it originally included physical abuse, but unfortunately that was amended on Committee Stage. We are seeking to restore physical abuse to the scope of the Bill. I agree with Deputy Shatter on the amendments that come towards the end of the Bill. It looks now as if we will not reach them by 1.30 p.m. and I seek extra time to debate those very important issues, which will arise at the end of Report Stage. They deal with people who have brought abuse to public attention. Those people may not be able to avail of the full scope of this Bill and it is very important that we have time to debate this section of the Bill.</P>

        <b>: </b>I appeal to the Tánaiste, in the interests of the public good and good legislation, to accede to the requests from Deputies Shatter and O'Sullivan to prolong this debate. There is an ongoing public debate on this matter which has only taken off since the Committee Stage debate, when thousands of people who were sadistically physically abused, though not sexually, found they were not covered by this Bill. If we do not get the legislation right today we will enshrine a totally inadequate provision in law that will cover sexual abuse but not physical abuse. Although sexual abuse gets highlighted in many cases, a huge number of people who have been sadistically physically abused have no rights <Col N="1046" /> under this Bill's provisions. I ask the Tánaiste to approach this in a measured and responsible way and to ensure the House has adequate time to debate the Bill, rather than bulldozing the measure through at 1.30 p.m. If not, the Bill will become part of an inadequate body of legislation dealing with an important and sensitive issue.</P>

        <b>: </b>In the aftermath of the television programme, &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;, it would be unthinkable that the victims of physical abuse should be treated in this way. It is bad enough that they are excluded from this Bill, but to shorten the debate to an hour and a half or two and a half hours would add insult to the injury already suffered. There is no reason the Government should not extend the time for this debate so that the issue can be fully debated and the concerns of those who have suffered physical abuse can be brought to the Government's attention.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 7, before &ldquo;SEXUAL&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;PHYSICAL OR&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When I published this Bill, I included physical and sexual abuse in its scope. It was subsequently amended on Committee Stage to remove physical abuse. The issue of physical abuse was referred to the Law Reform Commission. This amendment seeks to restore physical abuse to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to many people since my interest in the area has become public, many of whom were victims of abuse when they were children. <Col N="1058" /> Most of them were abused in institutions run by the State or financed by it. I have heard harrowing stories of abuse of all kinds. Most of those stories involved physical and sexual abuse. Some of them involved physical abuse only. Further stories detailed other methods of coercion and abuse of power. These children, who had no one else to stand up for them, were treated with appalling cruelty by people who flagrantly abused their power.</P>
    <P>Debate on this has been widespread. There was an enlightening television series which resulted in a public apology by the Taoiseach on behalf of the nation. There have also been promises of a commission and other issues. This is just a part of it, although it is an important part. People feel they need to be able to seek retribution when they are capable of doing that.</P>
    <P>Victims of physical abuse have been just as traumatised by what has happened to them as victims of sexual abuse. In many cases the two forms of abuse are intertwined. It is sometimes difficult to judge if an action is one of physical or sexual abuse &ndash; actions such as administering a beating to someone's bare buttocks.</P>
    <P>I will not go into details about the stories I have been told other than to say they are horrific. The effects of physical abuse are as traumatic as the effects of sexual abuse. It has limited people's capacity to deal with the rest of their lives. These people need to be able to seek civil retribution under the law. In cases of physical abuse, if this amendment is not accepted, it will not be possible to seek redress under this legislation if the statute of limitations period has passed. In the case of childhood abuse it is three years after the 18th birthday. Many of these people only now have the capacity to deal with the issue and because the abuse of them was physical they will be deprived of the benefits of the Bill, which is progressive in intent. It adds to the rights of people.</P>
    <P>Physical abuse must be included within the scope of the Bill. It is not enough to leave it to the Law Reform Commission because many people hope to be able to take action under the terms of this legislation. The victims of physical abuse should be able to take such action and they should not have to wait again while the commission deliberates on the issue.</P>
    <P>Separating physical and sexual abuse downgrades physical abuse and signifies that it is not as traumatic, powerful or appalling as sexual abuse. We are indicating that one abuse would not have caused as much trauma as the other. I am not in a position to judge that, but from talking to those who have experienced it I believe they are as traumatised by physical abuse. In addition, given that there has been so much interaction between these two forms of childhood abuse it is not appropriate to separate them.</P>

        <b>:</b> The amendments in my name seek to give effect to the same sentiments <Col N="1059" /> as those espoused by Deputy O'Sullivan. I am at a loss to know how the Minister can justify making a distinction between physical and sexual abuse. I cannot see how one can say that the emotional turmoil, trauma and psychological scars created by perverted physical abuse carried out on people 20 or 30 years ago is any less traumatic or damaging than sexual abuse. I fail to understand how the Minister, in introducing legislation, can defend a situation where he has only done half the job and then not even done that properly. He should do the job properly and comprehensively. The legislation should ensure that, regardless of whether the abuse is physical or sexual, both aspects are covered.</P>
      <P>We have been subjected to a tide of public protest on this issue and I am sure the Department has been likewise affected. The newspapers and radio commentary and chat shows also make it clear that the protest is against the fact that the Bill only deals with sexual and not physical abuse. When Committee Stage was concluded I wonder was it publicised that the Minister indicated he would doggedly stand over the Bill in its current form.</P>
      <P>I received a telephone call from a man now living in Los Angeles who left Artane in 1958. That man was very honest. He could have claimed he had been sexually abused because the perpetrator is dead, but he did not. He was clear that in his case, and in the case of the majority of his peers in Artane, perverted physical abuse was involved. A drawer was suitably adapted, the victims were asked to put their heads into it and, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, in such a constrained position they were physically beaten on the buttocks. Perhaps there was a sexual dimension involved, but the abuse was physical by its nature. The person who telephoned me did not make any claim that he was sexually abused but he said he was grossly physically abused. He pointed out that he was, therefore, excluded from having any civil redress under the terms of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In the interests of fair play, the common good and the right of redress by the thousands of people who were physically abused and who still carry the mental, psychological and physical scars, I appeal to the Minister to introduce a Bill that does the job properly rather than operating on an incremental basis, as tends to happen with legislation from the Minister's Department, when further amending legislation is often required. The Minister repeats the time-worn excuse that the matter is with the Law Reform Commission. When did it go to the commission? Has he sought an indication from the commission as to the current status of the issue? When does he anticipate a report from the commission? In the short term can he not do the decent thing and accept the thrust and the spirit of the sentiments expressed by Deputies O'Sullivan, Flanagan, Shatter and me and include physical as well as sexual abuse?</P>

      <P>The amendments before the House on Report Stage are in the same format as the amendments set down on Committee Stage. This arises because of the uncaring and insensitive attitude of the Minister on that Stage. When he replies to the points raised by Deputy O'Sullivan and others I hope he will show a little more sensitivity, flexibility and care than he did on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>If, thanks to Deputy O'Sullivan and the House, there is to be a remedy for persons against whom acts of sexual abuse have been committed, how can we deny a remedy to persons who have been subject to violent physical abuse? Surely these people have rights? Is there not a constitutional issue here? If a remedy is granted in respect of sexual abuse a remedy should also be granted in respect of violent acts of physical abuse.</P>
      <P>In many circumstances it will be difficult to differentiate between the two acts of abuse. There is a constitutional question here. I assume the Minister and the Government received advice from the Attorney General on the issue. I would like to hear it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In its current form this Bill is unworkable. While it will extend rights to a small number of people, it will not meet the primary purpose for which it was originally published and in the confined application proposed by the Minister it will not work. Deputy O'Sullivan published the Bill in its original form and we are now debating a truncated version. I published a similar measure on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. I am sure substantial thought went into Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill. Similarly, substantial thought and work went into my Bill.</P>
      <P>As published, both Bills dealt with the issues differently using different phraseology, but they both had the same intent. It was to address those who suffered injury as a result of physical and sexual abuse, injury which resulted in their being incapable for many years of coming to terms with the effect the abuse had on them, but who were finally able to do so. The Bills sought to ensure they would be able to bring legal applications to seek civil compensation against both abusers and State institutions and bodies whose neglect could be regarded as responsible for the abuse they suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I introduced to the House the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, which was published in 1988, the then Fianna Fáil Government tried to emasculate it. We defended the Bill on Second Stage and on Committee Stage because the Government did not have a majority on the committee. However, because some Deputies failed to appear in the House on Report Stage &ndash; they were not Fine Gael Deputies &ndash; the Government managed to emasculate a section of the Bill which meant that instead of it being a measure which would achieve the original purpose for which it was intended, it would create a great deal of damage and injustice. As a consequence of what happened on that occasion we <Col N="1061" /> were able the following week to put a motion to the House to have the Bill recommitted. We were successful with that. The persons responsible for emasculating that Bill were the Minister for Justice and, presumably, his departmental advisers. When the Bill was recommitted the sense of what the Fine Gael Party was saying about the measure was accepted, the extraordinary damage being done to the measure by the advice received by the Minister from his officials was recognised and the Bill was restored to a workable form in which it could achieve the objectives for which it was intended.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Labour Party and to Deputy O'Sullivan, if my Bill had been dealt with in this way by the Government, I would not be enthusiastically trying to have it enacted. I would be using every political avenue open to me to put pressure on the Government to restore the Bill to its original form and to allow it to be enacted with its original objectives intact. There is no purpose in the House putting through a measure which is fatally flawed and about which there may be major constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>There are major practical difficulties. The Bill seeks to allow those who have suffered sexual abuse to bring proceedings and to process claims within a period that is out of time under our existing Statute of Limitations. It excludes physical abuse. There is not, within the Bill as drafted, a definition of sexual abuse. Is sexual abuse something the victim perceives as sexual abuse or is it something that gives the perpetrator sexual gratification? If I get sexual gratification, because I have sado-masochistic tendencies, from beating up young children but never interfere with the sexual parts of their bodies, is that sexual or physical abuse? If, as a result of physical beatings victims suffer such psychological damage that their sexual lives into adulthood are seriously impaired although they were not sexually interfered with by the perpetrator of the abuse, is that sexual or physical abuse? If, because of my perversity and inclination, I spend a year terrorising a child under my care in a residential institution by making that child's life miserable, using the strap whenever it suits me, inflicting physical punishment by the use of my fists, depriving the child of food, engaging in activity where there may be other deprivation such as locking the child in a cellar and, having done so for that period of time for my own sexual gratification, I then start sexually interfering with the child and the child brings proceedings for compensation, can the child receive damages for the physical abuse he received before the sexual abuse started? The Minister may say the child can, because that may come within the definition of an act of sexual abuse but at what stage does it do so? If I beat up someone and then, within a day or two, sexually interfere with him, does that come within the definition of sexual abuse? If I beat up someone and then, two years later, sexually interfere with him, does that come within the definition? </P>
    <P>Are we going to have traumatic court cases <Col N="1062" /> involving people who have already suffered abuse, the quality of whose lives through many years has been substantially impaired, who have suffered severe psychological and physical damage, who have had to seek the assistance of psychiatrists and psychologists, who have been prescribed medication for depression or other psychiatric conditions caused by such events? Are we going to put such people in the witness box and have them cross-examined by lawyers acting for persons already convicted of abuse who are trying to limit the claim by establishing that a portion of the abuse was physical and should not give rise to compensation? Are we going to see the obscenity of lawyers representing the State, the Department and Minister for Health and Children, the Department and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Department and Minister for Education and Science adopting the type of approach adopted in the Brigid McCole case with the objective of limiting the financial impact to the State of any claim brought and, as a consequence, cross-examining victims of sexual abuse to try to tease out which elements of abuse are available for an award of damages and which are debarred by application of the Statute of Limitations as it now stands because they are classified as physical. Is this the type of law the Minister and the Government believe should be put in place and is in the public interest? Is it consistent with the apology extended to the victims of abuse by the Taoiseach in May of this year? I do not believe it is. This is making a travesty of well-intended legislation which was introduced to address an essential need.</P>
    <P>I find it impossible to come to terms with the Minister's approach. I do not know whether the Minister is acting on his own on this issue or is so constrained by departmental advice that he is incapable of seeing through the utter foolishness of dealing with this measure in this way. We were told there was some sort of ministerial committee examining the overall issue of abuse. Proposals to address the consequences of abuse suffered for decades by children in this country were apparently considered by a group chaired by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, with a sub-committee which included the Taoiseach and eight members of Cabinet. It defies imagination that eight members of the Cabinet could have agreed to this measure or that the totality of the Cabinet could have agreed to it being dealt with in this way in full understanding of the consequences of what is now proposed. Was there an information deficit? Did Ministers who were busy running their own Departments simply accept the advice given by the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and did the Minister simply reproduce to the committee the advice he was given by his officials?</P>
    <P>As someone who has drafted 17 Private Members' Bills, many of them dealing with legal issues of greater complexity than this, I find it incomprehensible that it was decided to try to separate sexual from physical abuse, to deal with <Col N="1063" /> sexual abuse as though in a vacuum and to pass the issue of physical abuse to the Law Reform Commission. The issue of physical abuse is no more complex than sexual abuse. Sadly, there are as many varied possibilities of physical abuse as of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Sending that issue to the Law Reform Commission not only creates a difficulty with the workability of this measure and creates the possibility of huge and substantial injustice but also means that for an extended period of time the victims of physical abuse will remain statute barred from bringing applications for civil compensation against both the perpetrators of abuse and the State agencies whose neglect and failure were directly responsible for the abuse that occurred. Newspaper headlines are more often devoted to cases involving sexual abuse than physical abuse. Research has established and future research will establish that over the decades this country has had a substantial problem of children in State institutions being sexually abused. However, there is an even greater number of children who, over the years, have been victims of physical abuse.</P>
    <P>The only rationale I can give for the distinction is that this Bill is not about addressing the problems of the injustice suffered by victims of physical and sexual abuse. This is a smart measure to limit the financial liability of the State and, in so far as claims for damages are made, to try to ensure that the majority of victims of abuse &ndash; in this context the majority are the victims of physical abuse &ndash; continue to be debarred for an extended period from seeking compensation against the State and State agencies for their neglect and failure to protect children in their care. This is a cost saving measure. It has nothing to do with the issue of physical abuse.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a speech delivered by the Taoiseach on 11 May 1999. Addressing Deputies and visitors at a presentation he was making he said:</P>
    <P>How children are treated is one of the key elements which defines any society. Over recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the many failures of our society in the treatment of children. Unfortunately, this has been a piecemeal approach driven by the bravery of individual victims determined to tell their stories and seek justice. A light has been shone into the dark corners of both our past and present, and these victims have performed an immense service in challenging our collective complacency. They have shown us that we cannot put the past behind us by ignoring it. We must confront it and learn its lessons. That is the least we can do to address the injustices of the past and the dangers of the present. The time has long since arrived when we must take up the challenge put to us all by the victims of childhood abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> This Bill is a piecemeal response by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address one aspect of a major problem and a failure to take up the challenge put to everyone by the victims of childhood abuse. Sadly, the Department's approach to this measure exposes the Taoiseach's remarks as nothing more than a cynical public relations response forced by media programmes highlighting the barbarity suffered by victims of abuse in State institutions.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing should be put in context. The manner in which he is dealing with this Bill and the area of sexual abuse means that the Bill excludes claims for compensation for physical abuse and does not even extend to all victims of sexual abuse a right to claim compensation in circumstances in which the Statute of Limitations currently acts as a barrier to their so doing.</P>
    <P>One of the earliest public spotlights on childhood sexual abuse derived from the Brendan Smyth case, a case which led to the fall of the Government. It exposed barbarous sexual abuse by a priest of young children in Northern Ireland. The resulting publicity led to proceedings in the Republic of Ireland following complaints by the victims of Brendan Smyth with regard to incidents that occurred in this jurisdiction. Those who made complaints of being sexually abused by Brendan Smyth would have made their complaints to the Garda over three years ago. That means that over three years ago they were, in the context of this legislation, individuals who had ceased to suffer a disability which rendered them unable to come to terms with what occurred to them.</P>

      <P>This measure will distinguish between the position and entitlement of victims of sexual abuse to process successfully court proceedings to seek compensation for the abuse suffered and those who suffered physical abuse and their entitlement to successfully process proceedings to seek compensation.</P>
      <P>There are many victims of sexual abuse or physical abuse whose quality of life has been equally impaired by the abuse suffered at the hands of the perpetrators of abuse. The Government in its proposals is seeking to distinguish in an arbitrary and illogical way between the different types of abuse. This provision is open to serious constitutional challenge. The danger of such a challenge is that if it were successful, it would simply result in the Bill being found unconstitutional instead of extending its provisions to the victims of physical abuse.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is passed in this form and continues to make this distinction, the President should refer it to the Supreme Court for a decision on its constitutionality. I do not believe a victim of abuse, faced with the possibility of having to address their own personal situation, should also have to confront the expense and upset involved in having to defend a constitutional issue. If the President refers the Bill to the Supreme Court and it finds it to be constitutionally sound, at least some victims of sexual abuse will be able to process their proceedings, although all victims of physical abuse will be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the President does not do that, I want an assurance from the Minister that a health board, which finds itself the subject of a negligence case taken by a victim of sexual abuse who, as a child, was in its care, will not seek to have the Bill set aside on the grounds of unconstitutionality to protect it from the financial consequences of a successful damages action. I also want an assurance that no team of lawyers acting on behalf of a Department will so deal with this measure. I want to ensure that, however defective the measure may be, victims of abuse relying on it to process a court action in circumstances where they may be otherwise debarred by the existing Statute of Limitations do not discover that their court proceedings are undermined and destroyed by the legal representatives of the State or its agencies seeking to have this measure declared unconstitutional. That is possible. It would be <Col N="1066" /> unprecedented, but the manner in which the Bill is being dealt with by the Minister is unprecedented.</P>
    <P>I appreciate this is a limited debate but it should not be. These issues are too serious. Thousands of people are affected who were in the care of the State in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and into the 1990s and in circumstances where State agencies lamentably failed in their duty to ensure children already perceived to be at risk and taken into care were given the proper protection, care and upbringing to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to stand by the distinction he makes. I do not want to bring other sections of the Bill into this, but I want to ask a question of the Minister in the context of the distinction between physical and sexual abuse. There is a provision in the Bill whereby an act of causing, inducing or coercing a person to participate in any sexual activity will be regarded by the Bill as sexual abuse. If I physically abuse people with an intent to coerce them into sexual activity but I do not succeed and sexual activity does not occur because, despite beating them black and blue, persecuting them and imposing various deprivations on them, they do not succumb or bend over to the whim of the perpetrator of abuse, is that sexual abuse or physical abuse? No sexual abuse will have occurred because the victim, despite the suffering, has not succumbed. Will we dance on the head of that pin?</P>
    <P>If the Minister says that, where I beat up people with the intent of sexually abusing them and they resist me, they can claim damages, will a court then be put in a position, in cases where there is no evidence of sexual abuse but substantial evidence of physical abuse, of trying to ascertain whether the intent of the abuser ten or 20 years ago was ultimately to coerce a sexual act or whether he or she was simply getting pleasure from the physical abuse? How will we deal with that issue? Is it covered by the Bill? Does it not put the spotlight on the unworkability and utter foolishness of this measure?</P>
    <P>The way in which the Government deals with this is a scandal and a disgrace. Despite the pleasantries of the Taoiseach, as uttered on 11 May when he announced that we would deal with sexual but not physical abuse in this measure, it confirms that, within Government and Departments, there is a complete lack of insight and understanding of the manner in which we should approach these issues. There is a failure to address the enormity of the barbarity to which children in this country were subjected and to understand the nightmare adults in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s in their daily social lives and in bed at night still suffer in trying to come to terms with what happened to them as children. There is no way in which the legislation can be enacted in this form and work in a manner which will put any humanity on the face of our legal system. The Minister should recognise that.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in political point scoring; I am interested in the issue. I am also greatly con<Col N="1067" /> cerned that people on whom abuse was perpetrated and whose plight was ignored for far too long get justice. We should not discriminate between the victims of physical and sexual abuse. The type of discrimination the Minister seeks to implement is probably legally unworkable in practice in many instances.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might answer the following question. If a child in an institution run by the State was a victim of physical abuse at the hands of one of the people running the institution, and there happened to be a second person in the institution who perpetrated sexual abuse on the child, and if the abusive experience, as is inevitable, seriously blighted the life of that person through his or her adult years, are we now saying he or she can bring proceedings to seek damages for the sexual abuse but not for the physical abuse because it was perpetrated by someone else? Are we saying that, if and when in the distant future the Law Reform Commission reports, the Government digests the contents of that report and the parliamentary draftsman drafts legislation in the area, the person can bring a second action in three or four years' time for physical abuse and that he or she can go into the witness box for a second time and relive the awfulness and barbarity of what was done when he or she was a child in an institution for which the State was responsible? How can any Government stand over legislation of that nature? There is no justice, humanity or common sense in it. It can only be the invention of a legalism and bureaucracy which is incapable of coming to terms with the issues we have an obligation to properly and comprehensively address.</P>

        <b>:</b> I support the amendments which want to restore to the Bill the concept that victims of physical abuse should qualify for the extension of time under which claims can be taken against perpetrators of physical violence.</P>
      <P>When RTE television showed the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; series of programmes, the nation was shocked as a result of the curtain which was drawn back on the decades of institutionalised violence by agencies of Church and State against the most helpless people imaginable, namely pre-teen and teenage children. Although the nation has unfortunately become somewhat accustomed to high profile court cases involving child sexual and physical abuse, the distillation of the experience of successive generations of children in that programme brought home the enormity of what was visited on a defenceless section of our population throughout the history of the State until relatively recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the shock which resulted from the revelations and the exposure of the awful experiences of a generation of children and youth, we had humble noises from the Government and the Taoiseach. In order to try to express or mollify the shock and anger of people throughout the <Col N="1068" /> country there were promises that the victims of that abuse would be adequately dealt with by the State in a fair and compassionate manner, unlike the way in which some other victims of the negligence of agencies of the State were dealt with in very recent times. Unfortunately, pushing this Bill through in its current form shows that the penitence of the Government was not very long-lasting.</P>
    <P>It is astounding that there is an attempt being made to make a distinction in the Bill between the impact of sexual and physical abuse on children or adults. In every county there are victims of sexual and physical abuse and a number of people took the opportunity to speak to me about their own experiences, particularly following the broadcast of the programme, &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;. It is absolutely clear that the effect and impact of years of sustained abuse, including physical abuse without explicit sexual abuse, can traumatise and paralyse a person for their entire lives. The idea that somehow, three years after the age of 18, people can be so fully recovered and of such a mind that they can make a clear and rational decision and a clear claim against the perpetrators of violence against them, shows that those who framed this legislation know nothing about the horrific emotional and psychological consequences of long-term physical abuse of innocent victims, particularly children and young people. To the injuries suffered by people in these circumstances is now being added the insult of the Government deliberately excluding them from the scope of the Bill, thereby taking away their right to seek just and appropriate compensation for incidents over an extended period which have made their lives a nightmare. It also creates a chasm between sexual and physical abuse. Those who are not experts but who have listened to the people concerned, know there is no such chasm. In fact, sexual abuse may manifest itself in large part in physical threats and domination, particularly by males over females and children.</P>
    <P>In pursuing the Bill in its current form the Government is adding another wrong to people who are already defenceless and in very vulnerable situations. Only yesterday I visited St. Mary's Special School in the Phoenix Park for children who have particular problems arising in many cases from their backgrounds. The teachers and those who deal with children who have been physically abused and threatened over a long time in their own homes will tell how paralysed these children are right into their teenage years and long afterwards. The State already fails those children most criminally in having totally insufficient resources to meet their needs and to intervene to allow them be healed from the horrific effects of violence which they have suffered. Precisely because of the failure of the State to provide sufficient resources, special schools and special residential care, sufficient psychological assistance and psychiatrists who are specialised in this area, the trauma is continued and the mental <Col N="1069" /> damage continues. In many cases there has not been effective intervention right into adulthood which would allow people get their heads and lives sufficiently together, thereby allowing them make a rational decision to take a compensation claim. The Government is telling those who eventually justly look for compensation that they may not seek it. It is adding insult to the injury which has been suffered. Everybody knows how really deep the suffering is of people who have gone through institutionalised violence or violence in the home or other areas. Therefore, to add this additional insult compounds the suffering and the wrong. To speak about the Law Reform Commission and a report in never-never time is not sufficient. The Minister must explain to the Dáil the very serious situation in which he is placing those people and justify doing so if he can.</P>

      <P>I have already outlined in some considerable detail on Second and Committee Stages the Government's approach to limitation periods in cases of child abuse of a non-sexual nature. Sexual abuse of children has always been regarded with particular abhorrence by the community, all the more so when such abuse is perpetrated by the people charged with the care and nurturing of children. As I stated in my contribution on Second Stage, the Government's view is that the case for changing the law of limitations as it applies to child sex abuse cases is unanswerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, it is practically impossible to hear the Minister. I am not an applicant in an Army deafness case, so perhaps the Minister could speak up a little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Sure. It is universally recognised that the abuse of a person of tender years in a sexual way can result in trauma which can prevent the victim from seeking help or redress for the abuse suffered, in some cases well into adult life. It is clear that special provisions regarding limitation periods to take account of that lasting effect should apply to civil actions where sex abuse is an element. This is not to suggest however that the issues surrounding physical abuse in childhood are regarded by the Government as being less serious or of less significance in our approach to childhood abuse. I am well aware from representations made and from having heard at first hand the harrowing stories of some of those whom I have met how such abuse has blighted many lives, leaving emotional as well as physical scars. Neither I nor the Government seek to neglect their position or exclude them in any manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's approach to the issue of childhood abuse has been open and proactive. That remains the approach. As I indicated on Committee Stage, such abuse can cover a wide range of activities, some of which would have been classed until relatively recently as reason<Col N="1070" /> able corporal punishment; others, by any standards, are unacceptable but may nonetheless not affect a person's ability to bring proceedings in a given time, while still others may have the same lasting trauma that is known to arise frequently out of sexually abusive acts.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding sexual abuse is clearcut. That is the reason we have supported the Bill to the extent that it deals with such abuse. As regards physical abuse, however, the situation is not clearcut. Because the issues are not clearcut the Attorney General, at my request and with the concurrence of the Government, referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission. The purpose of that referral is to have the benefit of the commission's research facilities, well established consultative processes and, most importantly, independent and considered advice on the way forward in this area of the law. I understand the commission's researches are under way. It does not make sense to pre-empt the advice sought by proceeding with legislation to deal with such cases. That is the reason the Government indicated its support for the Bill in so far as it deals with sexual abuse cases and I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage confining its application to actions arising out of sexual abuse in childhood.</P>
    <P>I have seen the Government's position on the Bill represented as a refusal to legislate for physical abuse cases and an unwillingness to deal with the issues. These comments misrepresent my position and that of the Government. These misrepresentations and attributions are wrong. The issue is being and will be dealt with. Before we can decide what changes should be made, however, the Government must know how best that change should be achieved. The Oireachtas should be in the same position.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that I gave repeated assurances on Committee Stage that I will act on the commission's report in a prompt and proactive manner. That remains my position. It would be a pointless exercise to request the commission to do this work only to pre-empt its findings by extending the scope of the Bill at this stage to include physical abuse. It may well be that its recommendations will fall in line with proposals contained in the Bill, but it is equally possible that it will recommend a different approach. It is a sensible and responsible approach to await the outcome of its work. This is a highly technical and complex area of the law and it is only right that we should have available to us the advice of experts. Any change in the law in relation to physical abuse should be informed by the commission's work if we are to ensure we achieve the best outcome in legislation. I will act in a prompt and proactive manner on its report when it becomes available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins is at a loss to understand the reason we cannot include physical abuse. I trust I have now explained precisely the reasons we cannot do so. The Deputy said that we should accept the thrust and spirit of the amendment, <Col N="1071" /> but thrust and spirit are of no benefit in this instance. Words in statute explain and clarify the law. Those words must be precise, clear and unambiguous. If this was a problem which was amenable to glib or shallow solutions I would have thought of them by now, but it is obvious to everybody that it is not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>The only solutions the Minister has come up with are glib and shallow. Is that what he is telling us?</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter suggested that no substantial thought was put into the Bill. That is as ridiculous as it is lamentable. That is precisely what the Law Reform Commission is doing, it is giving substantial thought to how the issue of physical abuse might best be addressed. The Deputy then made the extraordinary claim that sexual abuse was not defined in the legislation. That led me to the conclusion that he had not read the legislation. Sexual abuse is defined in section 2(4). If the Deputy had bothered to read it, it would not have been necessary for him to proceed as he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Sexual abuse is defined as follows: (a) any act of causing, inducing or coercing a person to participate in any sexual activity; (b) any act of causing, inducing or coercing a person to observe any other person engaging in any sexual activity, or (c) any act committed against or in the presence of a person that any reasonable person would in all the circumstances regard as misconduct of a sexual nature provided the doing or commission of the act concerned is recognised by law as giving rise to a cause of action. I respectfully suggest that before the Deputy criticises me or my officials he should at least do us the courtesy of reading what he is criticising us about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's insistence that there is no more difficulty in legislating in terms of sexual abuse than physical abuse, it must be clear even to the most critical or biased observer that his argument does not stand up and is built on sand. The Deputy and members of this party have alleged that this is a smart measure to delimit the liability of the State. This is ironic to say the least. I ask them to look at their own record in this respect. This is not a smart measure to delimit the liability of the State, it is a genuine attempt to deal with what is an extremely serious and grave issue. It is my intention to ensure justice is done and that in being seen to be done the correct mechanisms are in place to enable it to be done. Were I to do otherwise I would be in serious dereliction of <Col N="1072" /> my duty. That cannot be denied. This is not a financial cost saving measure. It is nothing of the sort and I deeply resent any assertion to the contrary.</P>
      <P>This matter was referred to the Law Reform Commission last May shortly after the Government announced its broad package of measures to deal with the question of abuse in childhood. It is my understanding that the commission's work is proceeding and that it is in the research phase of the process. I must point out that the commission is entirely independent in the exercise of its functions and it is not answerable to that extent to me or any other Minister of the Government.</P>
      <P>The allegation was made that this legislation is unconstitutional. I am not a member of the Supreme Court and I am not in a position to give anybody a cast-iron guarantee as to whether the legislation is constitutional but&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;it is my duty to accept the advice of the adviser to the Government, who is the Attorney General, and the advice available to me is that the legislation is constitutional.</P>
      <P>I have to refer to an argument which is trotted out on numerous occasions by Deputy Shatter against several Ministers for Justice of my party. I have heard him speak of the Minister being constrained by officials. I want to explain to him that this is a most offensive assertion and that officials in my Department take great personal offence to it because they are doing a job at the request, and on the authority, of the Minister and Government of the day, and that is precisely what they are doing in this instance.</P>
      <P>With regard to cases where a plaintiff seeks compensation which arises out of a mixture of sexual and other forms of abuse, it seems evident that the entire range of compensation sought would be encompassed by the disability rule provided for in this Bill. In other words&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one thing very clear to the House. This matter is being addressed with a great deal of consideration. It is being dealt with in good faith. There is no intention, nor was there ever, to delimit the State's financial liability in this most serious matter. I am trying, to the best of my ability, as is the Government, to put in place measures that are just so that people can get justice, whether they relate to offences of sexual or physical abuse. There may be some whom I cannot convince of that but I assure those people who are victims who are, as one speaker <Col N="1074" /> rightly said, vulnerable and who may have found themselves defenceless for many years, that this matter is being dealt with in good faith. I have no intention of allowing it to be politicised by whatever source. I would ask those people who have been deliberately and callously misrepresenting the position to desist from doing so because all they are doing is causing further deep pain. In that context, I accepted Deputy O'Sullivan's legislation in good faith because I did not want a political football made out of an issue of this gravity. It is only right that my word should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to take part in this debate because I am aware the House is understandably concerned about the consequences of sexual or physical abuse on victims. The sensitivity felt towards those victims should be reflected in our discussions here.</P>
      <P>The Statue of Limitations was introduced in 1957 so that there would be a balance between the right of injured citizens and the right of those by whom they claim they were injured. That is a fundamental obligation enshrined in all of our statute law. People who were under a disability &ndash; that has been traditionally a disability of age, as minors &ndash; were, therefore, taken as being entitled to initiate proceedings at a period outside of the limitation in the statute, be it three or six years in certain circumstances, from the time their disability ceased either through age, if they were minors, or if their mental disability ceased.</P>
      <P>Until now I have not had an opportunity to take part in these discussions but I have been generally impressed with the contributions, although I heard the Minister respond to some of the points made this morning. I have been generally impressed by the concern of all the speakers to ensure that if there is a special circumstance, which is clearly that arising under special abuse &ndash; this is a significant amendment to legislation which will be a tribute to this Oireachtas when it is introduced &ndash; a special statutory provision would be made in that regard. The question then arises whether there should be a statutory provision included to cover physical abuse.</P>
      <P>All of us, including the Minister, are sensitive to the trauma that arises from physical or sexual abuse and we must take account of that in terms of the disability period. There is no question that this is a delicate and difficult area and anyone who suggests otherwise is ignoring the principles of the law in respect of all of our citizens, including those against whom physical abuse is alleged and those who allege they were subjected to that physical abuse. It is not as simple as looking at only one side of the issue. Deputy Shatter will be aware of that from his own legal experience. The courts have already taken a broad and tolerant view in respect of plaintiffs who, up until the amendment of the 1991 Act, would certainly not have been entitled to bring claims before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> We are all familiar with the claims for noise induced deafness which are before the courts on a daily basis and which would previously have been defeated by the Statute of Limitations. The courts held, rightly, that claimants should not be debarred from making claims unless and until they knew they had a noise induced deafness and were aware that that deafness was caused by the negligence of the defendants, namely the Minister for Defence in his corporate capacity. For that reason, people who served in the Army during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and whose injuries dated back to those periods, have been able to bring claims before the courts on the basis that they did not become aware, until some time in 1994 or 1995, that the noise induced deafness from which they were suffering was caused by their service in the Army. That is the view the courts take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Should a person be able to claim for army deafness but not for physical abuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is far too intelligent &ndash; and I trust he accepts my intelligence and experience in this area &ndash; to make a nonsensical statement like that. I am talking about the general principles applied by the courts. I welcome this legislation but, even if were not to be passed, I would be of the view that there would be every likelihood that the courts themselves in the interpretation of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; would conclude that, because of the trauma and fear suffered by victims of sexual abuse, such abuse constituted disability sufficient to ensure that the statute would not begin to run against a plaintiff because of the sense of fear and intimidation which is a natural consequence of such abuse. I would be quite confident, having regard to the trend of court decisions, that the courts would hold that view even if this legislation were not passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not leave everything to the courts in these matters. It is quite proper that amendments should be introduced to this legislation. There is a distinction between physical and sexual abuse and the consequences suffered as a result of each. We are all agreed that we do not want to see victims of either physical or sexual abuse disadvantaged in any way in terms of the claims they bring. When I hear my colleague, James Nugent SC and others of his ilk suggesting, quite properly, that this area is so complex that the Law Reform Commission should examine it and that we should have the benefit of the commission's acknowledged experience, my case rests. Mr. Nugent's view represents the consensus view of my colleagues at the Bar. Mr. Nugent might be amused to hear his name mentioned in this House as he would not see himself as an adviser to the Government. Perhaps if there were to be a change of Government, we might see his name put forward for the position of Attorney General. If we introduce statutory provisions which have <Col N="1076" /> constitutional and legal implications, we should be careful that they will not be at risk of being struck down as being unconstitutional. There is a balance to be struck between the rights of the injured party and those of the party against whom a claim is brought.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to show real and effective concern for people who have been traumatised through physical or sexual abuse. However, we should not ignore the principles of the Constitution; we should wait and obtain the best possible advice from people who are well equipped to advise us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's word, which he gave us both on Committee Stage and here today, that he will act on the report of the Law Reform Commission. However, that will not address the problems which I and other Deputies have about the separation of physical and sexual abuse in this legislation. I want the provisions of this Bill to be availed of by as many people as possible who have been abused and who wish to take civil legal actions against the alleged perpetrators of the abuses. I have serious concerns that the legislation may not be as effective as it should be if the two types of abuse are separated. I strongly believe that people are just as traumatised by extreme physical abuse as they are by sexual abuse and that the two types of abuse should not be separated.</P>
      <P>People may have a difficulty in deciding whether they should take a case under this legislation where they have been both physically and sexually abused or where they may be unclear about whether their abuse would be defined in law as sexual abuse. Various instances were outlined in which it could be doubtful as to whether the abuse perpetrated was physical or sexual. There is a fear that if people do not receive advice quickly, the three years will catch up on them again. Will they find themselves in difficulty under the terms of this legislation if the definition of physical and sexual abuse is not clear? There is a difficulty with referring part of an issue to the Law Reform Commission. I urge the Minister to accept these amendments and not to break up the concept of this Bill which was intended to cover both physical and sexual abuse.</P>

        <b>:</b> I deeply resent the Minister's comment that some of us on this side of the House are politicising this issue. We are not. We are engaging in dialogue about a fundamental Bill which has been introduced to redress the long-standing grievances of hundreds, possibly thousands, of people about the lack of civil redress for the damage and injury inflicted on them as a result of the State's negligence, its abdication of responsibility and the fact that it stood back from the proper supervision of the welfare of the children of this nation for the best part of 70 or 80 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting together legislation, one must, as the Minister stated, be precise, clear and unambigu<Col N="1077" /> ous. The Minister is using this as the reason for not including physical as well as sexual abuse. Nothing is more precise, clear or unambiguous than the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; itself which has clear and obvious definitions and connotations.</P>
    <P>Definitions can be dangerous. Deputy Shatter outlined a number of hypotheses. They are not simply hypotheses for arguments sake but are real possibilities in relation to the three definitions of what constitutes sexual abuse, as defined in the legislation, and they should not be dismissed as being simply superfluous or for the purpose of making argument. They are real possibilities which will invariably be thrown up in court when they are presented by way of argument to define what is supposed to constitute sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think again about inserting the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; and leave it to the courts to decide. The reason we appoint judges and set up courts is to make determinations on facts. It is up to the judges, in their wisdom, to decide whether it comes within their definition and view of what is a physical assault on a youngster or during the period under challenge in the courts.</P>

      <P>The question I want to ask relates to the relationship between Government and the Law Reform Commission. The Minister always has an excuse &ndash; that it is not his fault, his hands are tied and this is a matter for the Law Reform Commission. The only speaker from the Government side, Deputy O'Kennedy, said leave it to the courts and it will probably be all right. Who makes the laws around here? Who is in charge of this shop? Under the Constitution, we are charged with responsibilities and powers to make laws.</P>
      <P>I accept it is a complex issue and one on which the advice and views of the Law Reform Commission should be sought. We heard that from the Minister on Second and Committee Stages and we are hearing it again on Report Stage. That we have to wait for the Law Reform Commission is stonewalling on the part of the Minister. The Law Reform Commission has produced many reports since its inception, most of which are very fine reports. The Minister knows there is a long time span between the publication of the report and the enactment of the consequences of that report by way of legislation.</P>
      <P>What steps is the Minister taking to communicate with the Law Reform Commission since this matter was considered on Committee Stage, amendments were voted on and since the committee accepted it is a matter for the Law Reform Commission and that we would wait for its report? Has the Minister stated to the Law Reform Commission that he wants a report on this matter by 1 January 2000 and before this measure passes through the Seanad? Stonewalling and saying it is not a matter for us and that we can wash our hands of it is doing the nation a disservice.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this legislation is to make sure the law can deal fairly with plaintiffs and defendants. It has nothing to do with the potential expense of particular defendants. It is a question of legal principle and not fiscal pragmatism. If the situation was otherwise, the Bill would have been defeated on Second Stage during Private Members' time but, instead, the Government supported the legislation.</P>
      <P>A number of points have been made. Deputy Higgins said to leave the issue of physical abuse for the courts &ndash; let the courts decide on the issue. If that were the case, perhaps he might like to tell me why I bothered in the first instance to give a definition of sexual abuse in the legislation. It must be clear to him that the reason for that is that there must be clarity in the law. That is precisely why sexual abuse was defined as it was.</P>
      <P>I cannot pre-empt what the Law Reform Commission will say on this matter. While it is not for me to inform the commission that it should do something by a certain date, we have made several inquiries as to how it has been progressing and I am satisfied that it is progressing the matter to the best of its ability.</P>
      <P>I find it somewhat ironic that Deputy Flanagan should describe my actions of referring the matter to the Law Reform Commission as an excuse. It is anything but an excuse.

As regards the problem of the person who is physically brutalised in an institution by one individual and then sexually brutalised by a different individual, I asked the Minister if it was illogical that one can bring court proceedings for the sexual abuse but not the physical abuse. The Minister did not respond to that.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue in the context of the sexual abuse definition and said there was not a full definition of sexual abuse. I am right because the definition in the Bill seeks to extend non-sexual abusive behaviour into being sexual abusive behaviour in certain instances. It goes on to refer to sexual activity or activity or misconduct of a sexual nature. I asked the Minister is it physical or sexual abuse if someone brutalises a young child with the intention of having sexual relations with them but never succeeds in engaging in sexual activity, but he did not answer that. I asked him if physical abuse, which does not involve sexual activity, carried out by an individual who is into sadomasochism was sexual or physical abuse, but he could tell us that. That is why I raised these issues and a variety of other questions to which the Minister failed to respond. One cannot promptly distinguish between physical and sexual abuse in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept it is a difficult issue and my colleagues and speakers on this side are right that if this Bill was extended to physical abuse, as it <Col N="1079" /> originally intended, and if the amendment Deputy O'Sullivan seeks to make was made, in line with similar amendments proposed by herself and Deputy Higgins, it would be left to the courts to determine physical abuse. The courts make that decision with regularity in dealing with care proceedings brought where children are abused physically and are currently taken into care. There is no mystery about the concept.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Shatter had read the legislation, I am sure he would have been able to answer most of his own questions. I am entitled to expect people to read the legislation before they come into the House to discuss such an issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last thing any of us wants is for this issue to become a political football. The core of this Bill did not separate sexual and physical abuse for very good reason. I have had extensive discussions with a number of people who <Col N="1080" /> have been abused and for them, the pain and trauma cannot be separated in terms of whether it was perpetrated in a physical or sexual way. It was perpetrated with callousness and cruelty and with extraordinary effects on the lives of those people. It is not right to separate the two issues and enact the legislation without including physical abuse.</P>
      <P>I listened to what the Minister said. I have the greatest respect for the Law Reform Commission but this is the legislation which will be enacted in the near future. I do not know how long we will have to wait to hear the verdict of the Law Reform Commission and for subsequent interpretation and legal action. The amendment seeks to reintroduce physical abuse and to restore the integrity of the Bill so that we do not separate the pain of physical abuse from sexual abuse. I will press this amendment to restore the words &ldquo;physical or&rdquo; to the Bill as well as sexual abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent weeks there was vote of no confidence in the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The immigration issue has been discussed at length. It is obvious that there is a conflict of opinion within the Cabinet about the matter. The Progressive Democrats Party has said that it will launch its policy in the next two weeks. It will be interesting to see if becomes Government policy.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we need a formal immigration policy. At present there is an <i>ad hoc</i>, reactive situation. There is no coherent policy at all. It is time, in light of the numbers of immigrants who are now arriving in Dublin, to get our act together. Human rights must be a firm plank of any new policy. We must recognise that people, whether they are seeking asylum for political reasons or they are economic migrants, must be treated properly.</P>
      <P>In April and May of this year we welcomed refugees from Kosovo. We could see the situation in their country on the television news. We all welcomed the fact that we were able to do something to help these people in a humane manner, that we were able to provide accommodation, support and everything necessary for people who have left their own country. Many people who leave their country would not choose to do that but feel they have to do it.</P>
      <P>It is important to put this in context. Ireland has a history of emigration. In Cobh there is a heritage centre to remind us of the coffin ships and what people went through when they left this country. There were no means of support for them here and they had to leave in droves. They were accepted into the United States. They established themselves there and now Irish culture is a major influence in America. In recent years there have been many American visas issued to this country. We have all made representations on behalf of people we know and we are all aware of the work being done by people such as Ted Kennedy, Tip O'Neill, Daniel Moynihan. We all welcomed the Morrison visas at a time when people could not find work in this country. This country could not support those people so they emigrated.</P>
      <P>We should look at immigrants in that context. We should think about how they can improve our society. Many of these people have qualifications which would help alleviate the skills shortage we now face.</P>
      <P>Employers cannot recruit people, yet many asylum seekers would welcome the opportunity to work. Unfortunately, the system appears to be stagnant. It cannot process all the applications.</P>
      <P>The Government needs to move the operation out of Dublin. The Eastern Health Board one-stop-shop in Dublin has to deal with everything. It is not working. There have been queues resulting in the inhumane treatment of people who have been left to stand in the rain. There are no facilities to deal with children, there is not anybody to explain what is happening and shutters are being pulled down at 5 o'clock in the evening. That is not the kind of image most people want to see, nor do they want to see the country dealing with asylum seekers in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to crack down on trafficking in illegal immigrants. I appreciate the necessity for a form of control because some <Col N="1087" /> unfortunate asylum seekers are abused. I understand some Romanians had to pay an initial transportation fee and then make payments from their social welfare entitlements. It is necessary to clamp down on that.</P>
    <P>However, I and my party are wary of the possible implications of the legislation. Does it mean that Aer Lingus staff or Irish Ferries operators will be impounded? We will look at that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We need a humane approach to this problem. We must recognise that travellers to the country face a language barrier, different customs, culture and background. Their health also needs to be addressed. People travelling to a strange country need support. Asylum seekers can wait for up to seven years to have their applications processed. That must be addressed. We must also develop a coherent immigration policy. We should not have to respond to crises.</P>

It is piecemeal, begrudging and damaging to the interests of people who are defenceless, are suffering and are extremely vulnerable. As usual it is being introduced under false pretences, in this instance the pretence that there is a crisis of enormous proportions with regard to people seeking refuge here and that the numbers seeking refuge are somehow orchestrated by highly organised gangs of Mafia threatening the State and the population.</P>
      <P>These lurid claims are made to enable the Government to justify legislation that is narrow and xenophobic. If Mafia gangs are involved in trafficking I deplore it. However, we should not criminalise refugees or people genuinely seeking to help them, from honest humanitarian motives, under the guise of taking on the criminal Mafia. If these criminal elements are exploiting vulnerable people they will not come under the scope of this legislation or jurisdiction. In that sense the Bill is a fiction.</P>
      <P>This legislation could criminalise any citizen or person who assists somebody escaping from a well founded fear of persecution, injury or even death. For example, an aid worker in an African state with an oppressive regime might assist somebody to escape rapidly and arrange for that person to travel to Ireland to be introduced to, say, friends. If the person travelled here in a hurry and then applied for political asylum the aid worker who gave such assistance could be found guilty of a serious offence and face imprisonment for up to ten years. That is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does it say about the attitude of the Government to our history? What about the tens of thousands of youth who travelled to the streets of Boston, Chicago and New York in the 1980s at a time when Fianna Fáil Deputies begged the US Administration to make them legal? If the <Col N="1088" /> principle of this legislation was applied, any Irish born persons in the US who assists a relative, friend or neighbour to travel to the US and stay beyond their time could be imprisoned for ten years. Is that the message the Government wants to send to the US and other countries where Irish people seek to make a new home for whatever reason?</P>
    <P>The Episcopal commission on emigration recently produced a report which showed that 1,287,987 Irish born people live beyond the boundaries of this State, yet the fact that a few thousand people are travelling here appears to be a crisis for the Government. The report points out that more than 1,000 Irish people are imprisoned in other countries for various crimes.</P>
    <P>This Bill dances to the tune of the odious attitudes and statements of Fianna Fáil backbenchers, such as Deputy Callely. His remarks appalled a majority of people in the country. It is a disgrace that a Fianna Fáil backbencher would attempt to play on the resentment of poor Irish people about their lack of proper housing and accommodation and seek to blame refugees and people seeking asylum. It is incredible that a Deputy from a party whose funders &ndash; the builders and developers &ndash; have created the housing crisis and shortage of building space should seek to scapegoat innocent people. The principal of an inner city school recently stated that he must go outside the gates of his school to protect some children of a different colour who are attending it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely and his ilk carry a moral responsibility for the racism of a small and sick minority in our society. Words spoken from the comfort of Leinster House or the Eastern Health Board, where, scandalously, he is still the chairman, are taken to heart by this sick minority as they carry out racist actions. It is beyond belief that he was not censored by his party leader and the Minister and fired from the Eastern Health Board. Let us welcome people who are in need as millions of our people were welcomed throughout the world.</P>

      <P>When he introduced Second Stage of this Bill the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said he &ldquo;did not intend turning the debate into a discussion on our immigration and asylum policy&rdquo;. What immigration and asylum policy? The debate on this Bill is part and parcel of the debate on immigration and asylum, in spite of the Minister's best intentions. If the Government had a coherent policy on asylum with equitable treatment for asylum seekers, sound legislation, fair practice and adequate resources and a proper immigration policy which recognises the right of economic migrants and the labour needs of the Irish economy this Bill could be considered as an element in an overall framework. We could then examine the issue of illegal trafficking separately and distinctly. However, we have none of these things. Instead, we have a patchwork of reactive <Col N="1089" /> legislation. We have a Refugee Act which has not been fully implemented, an Immigration Bill which is really a deportation Bill, a scandalous situation at the Refugee Applications Centre in Lower Mount Street, an undercurrent of racism against asylum seekers and immigrants which has been encouraged by the comments of some Deputies, a work-permit system which is unworkable and proposals to fingerprint asylum seekers over the age of 14 and to introduce a demeaning voucher system for asylum seekers. In summary, we have a total and complete travesty.</P>
      <P>Those are not my words. They are the words of Peter Finlay, SC, one of five Government appointed lawyers in the Independent Appeals Authority. I cannot let this debate pass without putting on record this scathing criticism of the current system by Mr. Finlay. He has characterised the system as trammelling the rights of asylum seekers, particularly by the lack of proper legal representation and he has made a very sensible call for an amnesty for asylum seekers already in the country, a call I fully endorse.</P>
      <P>None of this negates my support for the basic principle underlying the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill. The exploitation of vulnerable people by unscrupulous traffickers in human misery is contemptible and needs to be stamped out. The Minister has the unanimous support of the House on that. This Bill is supposed to address the problem. However, because of its provisions and the context in which it comes before the House, the Bill is deeply problematic. I cannot, therefore, give it my support as it stands.</P>
      <P>There are many unanswered questions in the Bill and in the Minister's speech. Do we have any idea of the true extent of trafficking? Do we know the proportion of asylum seekers who are brought here by such trafficking? The Minister stated that &ldquo;taxis and private vehicles are daily travelling from Northern Ireland and discharging their illegal passengers in Dublin&rdquo;. We have no indication of the extent of this practice. I have not seen evidence of it on the N1 or the N2.</P>
      <P>It is far from clear how this Bill, if enacted, will be enforced. It seems that the traffickers are outside the jurisdiction and it is difficult to see how they will be amenable to the new law. Legitimate concerns have been raised as to the possible use of these new powers against people who legitimately assist those fleeing persecution in other lands. Will they be used against people who seek to bring in other family members. The Minister presented the target of the Bill as organised trafficking in people for profit but the Bill creates the offence of organising or knowingly facilitating the entry of an illegal entrant. Knowingly facilitating is a vague term and could conceivably be used against individuals and groups who are genuinely assisting vulnerable people. The Minister has signalled that redrafting may be necessary here as his intention is to deal with commercial trafficking. I await with interest his amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> One of the most alarming things in the Minister's speech was his statement that he is &ldquo;considering whether it is necessary to impose responsibility on carriers to ensure that they bring to the State only those passengers who are legally entitled to come here and to provide for sanctions to punish carriers who fail to live up to this responsibility&rdquo;. I urge the Minister to drop this proposal. It is a recipe for disaster. It will require airlines and ferry companies to act as unofficial immigration officers, to turn people away from boats and planes or to turn back in mid-passage on suspicion that passengers may be illegal immigrants.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that &ldquo;if we wish to ensure the asylum process is fully functioning and available to those who need it we must protect it against those who would abuse it&rdquo;. I agree, but we do not have a fully functioning asylum process available to all who need it. In the words of the Minister's appointee, we have a &ldquo;total and complete travesty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill needs to be reworked and to be brought back to the House, together with legislation based on a fair and just immigration policy which will allow people in numbers which can be determined to come to this State to work. We need the full implementation of the Refugee Bill, an end to deportations and an amnesty for those asylum seekers at present in the State. Until we have this just framework of policy and legislation I withhold support for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate, particularly because in Helsinki today the European Council will be announcing the establishment of a new European body for the protection and promotion of fundamental human rights. I have been asked by the Taoiseach to be his representative on that body and our first meeting will take place next week in Brussels. The need for that body is very clear because the issues that have concerned us here for some time are not confined to this country. They are characteristic of all EU member states and our approach to this question must always be to embrace in the family of human rights in our jurisdiction those who seek or need refuge in our country and those who look to this country as a place where they can relaunch their lives in an atmosphere of economic opportunity and freedom from repression and injustice. The European body will be addressing these issues for some considerable time. Debates similar to those which have taken place here are taking place in every parliament in Europe, sometimes with a degree of venom which would make opinions expressed here seem very mild. Europeans must deal with this issue together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> The issue we deal with today is a very specific one. The offensively criminal elements who purport to make profit from the misery of people must be isolated, sanctioned and punished. The law has always held people of that sort in contempt and ensured that the strongest legal force was used to ensure that criminal elements would not be able to profit from the suffering or disadvantage of others. That is long established in all our laws and in terms of international co-operation this Bill is a necessary culmination of that principle. We have long had a law against living off immoral earnings which is directed at the lowest form of life; we refer to them as pimps who force young girls to engage in certain activities for the pimps' profit. They intimidate those young women.</P>
    <P>The same is happening in this context and we should not close our eyes to it, although there appears to be a consensus on the issue in that regard. There are people on our streets &ndash; they are not targeted by this Bill &ndash; who are being forced and intimidated through criminal oppression to return funds to these outrageously offensive profiteers in human misery. If we want to ignore that, we can. However, anybody who is familiar with the scene knows that some of the youngsters and women on the streets are not necessarily begging for themselves. In most cases, they do it to pay off the extortionate demands of those who brought them to this country illegally.</P>
    <P>This jurisdiction is based on fundamental rights and we are obliged to uphold them, regardless of what views we might have on nuances or differences. We must attack this trafficking at the source. That is what the Bill does and I am privileged to have had this opportunity to contribute to the debate on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Kennedy for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>The issues prior to the 1997 general election were unemployment, crime, taxation and the Northern Ireland peace process. These matters have, more or less, been resolved. Since then we have experienced unprecedented economic growth and the issues today are housing, traffic and transportation, child care, refugees and immigration.</P>
      <P>In 1995, there were 424 asylum seekers in this country. In 1998, there were 4,626 asylum applications. Up to October of this year there were 5,497 applications. In October there were 1,000 applications. This cannot be ignored, and that is why this Bill is so important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Internationally organised criminal elements are engaged in illegal trafficking of non-nationals for commercial gain. This cannot be tolerated. This problem was recognised at the European Council summit at Tampere and I welcome the wide range of measures agreed by the Council on justice and home affairs issues. I also welcome the appointment of Deputy O'Kennedy to the body he mentioned as a result of this Council meeting. <Col N="1092" /> The summit demonstrates that this problem has a European and international dimension. It is not an Irish problem which requires an Irish solution.</P>
    <P>Ireland has no colonial tradition but it has a missionary tradition. It has a track record of helping poverty stricken countries. A new dimension to the problems faced by the Third World and eastern European countries is the associated movement of refugees and emigrants. This dimension has not yet been fully appreciated in this country. People who come here must be treated humanely and I believe that is what happens. In due course, refugees will be allowed to remain while illegal immigrants will be deported following fair procedures.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the humane regime he has put in place since 1997 and I condemn the chaos that existed prior to that. The Minister introduced a wide range of measures to deal with this. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to list them but they have been listed in previous debates. I welcome this new debate on refugees, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. It was sparked by my colleague, Deputy Callely, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, when they highlighted what is happening. However, the problem will not be solved by ideology. Some have claimed that this new influx of asylum seekers is exciting and will lead to a multicultural society. This type of thinking does not help. This is a practical problem requiring a practical response. Let us leave ideology out of it.</P>
    <P>An open door policy, as is advocated by some, would be crazy. I endorse a previous statement by the Minister that all states need effective laws dealing with the entry, residence and departure of non-nationals in the interests of the wellbeing of society. He could not have said a truer word. There is a great deal more I could say on this subject but my time is up. There is genuine fear in the community, particularly in working class areas, which must be dealt with, but I will return to that and other topics on another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this important Bill. The debate has ranged widely and touched on many facets of the immigration issue and the related issues of asylum and refugees. While it has strayed beyond the strict ambit of the Bill before the House, it was proper to review not only the proposals in the Bill but also the context in which the need for the Bill arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks, I have given the House a comprehensive account of our immigration and asylum policy and law, including the measures the Government has put in place to deal with the significant increase in asylum seekers which we have witnessed in recent years. The purpose of this legislation is to deal with those who seek to exploit asylum seekers and other immigrants by engaging in the despicable trade of trafficking. Our legislative framework is deficient because <Col N="1093" /> there is insufficient power to enable the State to deal with traffickers.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to address that deficiency by criminalising the activity of traffickers and providing for ancillary and necessary powers. Few people could contend that this legislation is unnecessary. To do so would be to refuse to face reality. Traffickers are targeting this country. There is broad support in the House for the aim of the Bill although Deputies have pointed to improvements they consider necessary. I am grateful for this support and I will consider all suggestions as sympathetically as possible.</P>
    <P>All states need effective laws to deal with the entry, residence and departure of non-nationals in the interest of what I once described as the wellbeing of society. This Bill is intended to act as an aid to the proper exercise of such control. It does not, and is not intended, to penalise the victims of such traffic. If the victims are asylum seekers, their applications will be processed in accordance with the procedures we have put in place. The Bill does not change the rights and duties of an asylum applicant.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Howlin and Higgins, were concerned that the Bill should not encompass the humanitarian activities of<i> bona fide</i> persons or organisations who assist asylum seekers. The Oskar Schindlers of this world have been mentioned as the type of people whose activities should not be criminalised. I do not intend to criminalise the activities of those who, for humanitarian reasons, help genuine asylum seekers. Such activity is not and never was the focus of the Bill. A number of Deputies also appeared to believe that the Bill would criminalise the activities of family and friends who simply help those close to them to come to this State. While I do not condone acts of illegality, such action, like the humanitarian assistance to which I have already referred, is not the focus of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The target is the profit seeking trafficker. I intend to make this crystal clear in the Bill. I have asked the parliamentary draftsman to consider this issue with a view to introducing an appropriate amendment or amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Either the Opposition has a short memory when it comes to my record on human rights legislation or it is so obsessed with the issue it overlooks the unprecedented progress I have made on legislation in this area. I recently introduced the Human Rights Commission Bill, one of the most significant human rights measures ever to come before the Oireachtas. The Employment Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace on a wide range of grounds has been enacted despite the failure of the previous Government to produce constitutional legislation in this area, a comment which also applies to the Equal Status Bill before the House. In the wide range of criminal justice legislation I have introduced, I have given priority to the fundamental human right of ordinary law-abiding people to be <Col N="1094" /> protected from the activity of criminals while at the same time maintaining the balance between the rights of accused persons and their victims, which is a hallmark of any civilised society.</P>
    <P>A misconception seems to exist among Opposition Deputies that Ireland is the only country which exercises control over non-nationals who wish to come here. Much of what passes for debate in the media on immigration issues is badly informed and takes no account of the wider international context, especially the fact that all States exercise control on immigration. Deputy Higgins is naive if he thinks that countries such as the United States of America impose no such controls because they do.</P>

      <P>The USA has carrier's liability in addition to strict immigration controls. Anyone who goes through US pre-entry clearance at Dublin or Shannon Airport would know all about this. It is often said that Ireland has no immigration policy and that we must develop such a policy. However, we have an immigration policy, and it is on broadly similar lines to the policies followed by the UK and our other EU partners.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell welcomed the Bill but was concerned that it would be unfair to criminalise the truck driver who does not check his vehicle and ends up bringing asylum seekers or stowaways into the country. Deputy Gormley seemed to think the Bill provided for on-the-spot fines for taxi drivers. It does not. What the Bill provides is that, to commit a trafficking offence, a person must organise or knowingly facilitate the entry of an illegal immigrant to the country, and he or she must know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is an illegal immigrant. While there may be a need to examine the responsibility of transporters to check their vehicles for stowaways, such responsibility is not the focus of section 2.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes was concerned about the provisions of section 5 relating to the issue of search warrants to a member of the Garda Síochána by a judge of the District Court. The wording of section 5 is not new. It mirrors provisions relating to entry, search and seizure in other legislation in respect of certain serious offences, for example, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, and the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998. One of the recommendations of the report of the expert group appointed to consider changes in the criminal law and echoed in the Garda SMI report was that this type of power should be available for all serious offences. I am considering this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed that the Refugee Act should be brought into effect as soon as possible. Work is advancing apace in my Department towards the full implementation of that Act, and it involves the preparation of the necessary <Col N="1095" /> regulations to ensure the smooth running of the asylum system on a statutory basis as well as the process of recruiting the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. As regards the latter post, the policy intention, that it be a non-Civil Service position, may not, according the advice available to me, be fully achieved by the existing wording of the Refugee Act. I will accordingly bring forward by way of amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage, a minor technical amendment to that Act to clarify the matter as well as any other necessary amendments to ensure the full and effective implementation of the Act. I expect the preparatory work and the recruitment process will be completed in time for me to make the orders commencing the Refugee Act soon.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which became apparent recently arising from the increase in asylum applications have once again been stressed. I have already indicated the measures the Government is taking to ensure we have the resources to provide services of a high standard to these applicants. We are doing this with full commitment to ensure the dignity and welfare of applicants. However, we must also underpin our approach with strict measures to ensure our country's generosity is not abused. The Bill is one such measure. Anyone who has dealt with genuine refugees will know how important it is that the exceptional channel outside normal immigration rules designed for those genuinely fleeing persecution is kept open for such people and is not allowed to be used by the traffickers to flout our immigration laws. The issue of immigration and asylum is the subject of discussion at Government level at present. As part of that process, I will shortly submit proposals which will inform the basis of Government decisions on future policy and strategy in this area.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions. Some contributions were not constructive and appeared to have been based on false premises.</P>

      <P>Many people could be forgiven for believing the months between December 1994 and June 1997 represented some class of golden era for asylum seekers in Ireland. They could also be forgiven for believing that the facilities in place for asylum seekers who came to this country during the brief life of the previous Government should be regarded as being state of the art, a paragon against which all subsequent facilities, national and international, could be unfavourably compared. The same people could be forgiven for believing that the resources, both monetary and political, assigned to asylum seekers by the previous Administration have been slashed by the Government. A concerted drive has been launched to portray the Government as <Col N="1096" /> an Administration which has turned off a tap of plentiful resources for asylum seekers which had been left freely flowing by the previous Administration. Nothing is further from the truth.</P>
      <P>Any independent and dispassionate evaluation establishes beyond contradiction that every area of governmental endeavour relating to asylum seekers was treated with a mixture of aloof disdain and indifferent incompetence by the previous Administration. When action was within its power, it chose inaction. Now that its members have regained their preferred position of comfortable incapacity on the Opposition benches, they seek to suggest that less resources are now deployed than when they were in a position to make decisions. The people who seek to turn the spotlight of criticism on the Government brought prolonged and practised paralysis to bear on the situation when they were in a position to act. Those who refused to inch forward now choose to criticise the strides we have taken.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of accepting criticism from those whose lack of vision and effort did so much to create the problems which confronted asylum seekers and the Government in June 1997. I have no intention of subscribing to the illusionary orthodoxy now being peddled by the Neros of the 1990s and their acolytes that the problem with asylum seekers started when the people selected a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. Like must be compared with like, effort with effort and endeavour with endeavour. If this is to be an honest and open debate and not a cynical exercise in political opportunism, it is appropriate that we compare the work of the Government regarding asylum seekers with the work of the previous Administration. It is important we compare the resources put in place by the Government and contrast them with the resources allocated by the previous Administration. It is also important that we seek out and examine what, if any, alternative plan is being proffered by those who express dissatisfaction with the actions of the Government.</P>
      <P>The hard statistics establish beyond dispute that no Government in the history of the State has deployed resources to the extent that this Administration has. Facts as opposed to prejudices and innuendo establish that the commitment of the Government surpasses that of any previous Administration. Utilising any recognisable criterion to compare the work of this Administration to the work of its predecessor regarding asylum seekers, it will be seen that this Administration is more committed, has deployed greater numbers of civil servants, has provided greater resources and has dealt with greater numbers than those who now seek to criticise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it perhaps the case that those who were bereft of ideas when in Government have worked assiduously in Opposition and now seek to present what eluded them in office, namely, a coherent plan which addresses the needs of asylum seekers and the administrative difficulties presented by their arrival? Unfortunately it is not. <Col N="1097" /> The same lack of vision and ability which heralded the departure of the previous Administration from office still afflicts its members' attitudes to asylum seekers. When in office, they did not know what to do, so they did nothing. No one knew of what they were in favour nor to what they were opposed. They stood for nothing so they did nothing. They are entitled to praise only for the consistency of their effort.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one example in the course of this debate and the debate on the motion of no confidence serves to best illustrate the confusion of the Opposition. The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, said deportations were necessary. The president for life of the Labour Party, Deputy De Rossa, said he opposed deportations. I did not hear Deputy De Rossa voice concern when people were deported to Siberia, but he is against deportations to Holyhead.</P>

      <P>I have on a number of occasions over recent years pointed out to the EU both within the Council of Ministers and in bilateral discussions with the Commissioner the deficiencies in the sheepmeat regime. At the recent meeting of the Agriculture Council last month, I outlined the serious income situation facing sheep producers and the failure of the ewe premium system to properly compensate Irish producers because of the lack of convergence of prices across the European Union. In particular, I requested the Commissioner to take urgent <Col N="1098" /> action to address these issues, including by way of the temporary suspension of the stabiliser or through the payment of a supplementary premium in member states where prices are significantly below the EU average. Apart from the United Kingdom, there was no support for these suggestions from other member states.</P>
      <P>I have also raised the extensification premium with the Commission on a number of occasions in recent years. The Commission has refused to exclude sheep from the calculation of stocking density for the extensification premium because it claims that to do so would introduce a new inequity between beef producers who also raise sheep and beef producers who rear cattle only. I again raised the sheepmeat regime anomalies at the November Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting and Commissioner Fischler indicated that he intends to review the current sheepmeat regime next year which I regard as a significant development. I intend to continue to pursue this matter with the Commissioner, and as appropriate with the EU Agriculture Council.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile to remember that, in spite of all its defects, the ewe premium system provides income support for Irish producers amounting to approximately £110 million per annum with a further £22 million coming from headage payments under Structural Funds. Sheep producers also derive considerable benefits from the REPS and I ask sheep producers not yet in REPS to give serious consideration to joining the scheme, which has conferred considerable benefits on those producers who are already participants. The amount of money contributed by the EU and indeed the Exchequer to the sector is quite substantial and, while I am fully committed to securing improvements in the system, we have to acknowledge that the regime per kilo of sheepmeat produced is seen to be relatively expensive by the Commission and other member states.</P>

      <P>Every time we speak about sheep the Minister starts on the wrong foot. On this occasion he tried to defend the indefensible. We are talking about 45,000 Irish farmers who are getting less by way of premium for their sheep even though they receive less for their lambs than anywhere else in the EU. We are either a member of the EU or we are not. What is the Minister doing for the 45,000 sheep farmers? What happened on the night of the Agenda 2000 discussions when he turned his back on them? Ireland and the UK are the only countries which practice mixed grazing, and the Minister did not raise a murmur on that occasion. Following a bad year for sheep farming, will the Minister outline the future he expects for sheep farmers next year and what proposals he is putting to the EU?</P>

      <P>As I have repeatedly said, I have raised the sheepmeat regime at the Council of Ministers and bilaterally with Commissioner Fischler on numerous occasions. Inequity exists, <Col N="1099" /> and until the November Council when the UK rowed in behind us, no other member state supported my position. There is inequity in three areas. It is patently inequitable that French farmers get the same ewe premium as Irish farmers while they get at least one third more in price &ndash; they get between £1 and £1.30 per lb whereas Irish prices range from 80p to £1.05 per lb. Second, there is an obvious inequity in the stabiliser which should be abolished. A third patent inequity concerns extensification whereby sheep are included for stocking density but excluded for payment. At the last meeting, with the support of Nick Brown, the UK Minister, the Commissioner acceded to our request to have the sheepmeat regime reviewed. He will return early in the new year with the outcome of that review and I hope these inequities are addressed on that occasion.</P>

That was the night to think of Irish sheep farmers. The Minister is now returning to the Commissioner with a huge problem which six months ago he said did not exist. The Minister has done a horrendous job in terms of sheep farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully acknowledge the role played by family butchers and recognise that they can have much to offer to the market in terms of high quality product and traceability of supply. While the retail market is highly competitive, there is no doubt that operators who can offer top quality products, produced and supplied in a manner which meet the wide-ranging and high demands of today's consumer have a definite role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Family butchers, because of the nature of their activity, must comply with food safety and hygiene standards which are provided for in EU and national legislation. The purpose of these legal standards is to ensure an acceptable level of meat hygiene and to guarantee public safety. New EU state aid rules preclude member states from providing financial assistance to operators aimed at bringing them up to minimum hygiene and <Col N="1100" /> food safety requirements. Standard operating procedures have been drawn up by my Department for small abattoirs slaughtering less than six livestock per week in an effort to ensure that costs incurred by them in meeting mandatory hygiene and food safety standards are minimised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the EU precludes member states from giving financial assistance to the sector? If that is the case, are there any other means by which the Minister can assist the sector? There are about 5,000 employed in the small abattoir sector, with at least another 5,000 in the retail sector. They need financial assistance because our standards are increasing and our regulations are becoming more demanding. Given the scale of their business many face the prospect of being put out of business unless the State can find a way to assist them.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that family vituallers provide a great service in supplying fresh meat to consumers but as a member of the European Union we are precluded from providing assistance in the areas mentioned. We may be able to do so however, in the case of a new quality product. Departmental officials have had meetings with the butchers organisation. If it has something new to offer I will not have a difficulty in having a further meeting with it. There is a new food subprogramme but it is very restrictive in terms of who can qualify. The European Commission is very strict when it comes to the provision of state aid through measures of this nature, especially when there is over capacity in larger abattoirs.</P>

      <P>Practically everybody would agree with the Deputy. I am aware of the difficulties. There are two main areas of concern &ndash; slaughtering and refrigeration. Without good refrigeration equipment, one will not have a quality product. Even with the best will in the world it is still very difficult to find a way to help given the restrictions in place. I fully recognise the value of family victuallers to the fresh meat sector and the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The international pigmeat market has been experiencing serious difficulties over the past year or so due to the combination of oversupply of pigs and substantially reduced demand in the traditional import markets of Russia and the Far East. Ireland's pigmeat sector has not been immune from these developments.</P>
      <P>Despite the current difficult market situation Irish pigmeat prices have increased by nearly 18% since the beginning of the year. Measures I have taken to alleviate the difficult market situation have contributed to this improvement. For example, I negotiated subtantial increases in export refunds in 1998 and again in 1999. I pressed for and was successful in obtaining the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme which helped to remove more than 420,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the EU market. The EU food aid programme for Russia which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat has also served to remove substantial quantities of pigmeat from the market. Nevertheless the situation is still unsatisfactory as many producers are still losing money even though prices have improved.</P>
      <P>I raised the weak market issue at the most recent Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in November and with several other member states requested further market support. At national level I had further meetings in recent weeks with the feed suppliers, banks and pigmeat processors to ensure everything possible was being done in terms of slaughtering schedules and capacity as well as marketing initiatives to lessen the adverse effects of the market weakness on the primary production sector. In terms of processing capacity I have asked Enterprise Ireland to examine the matter as a matter of urgency and to consider the current structure of the sector. It is commissioning a study as a result. I will continue to use every means at my disposal to ensure an improvement in the market as quickly as possible.</P>

Everybody knows that they are looking down the barrel of a gun. Is the Minister prepared to bale out in an imaginative way from the Exchequer, those worst affected to ensure they will benefit from any upswing in the market or will they allowed to sink leaving us with a few big producers?

      <Quest>the number of herds affected by tuberculosis and brucellosis for the past three years, on a county by county basis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25888/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to circulate the tuberculosis and brucellosis statistics for the past three years requested by the Deputy in tabular form in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>On tuberculosis, it is expected that the number of reactors this year will be about the same as last year when 44,500 reactors were disclosed. These levels are too high. I am particularly concerned at the increase in the number of reactors identified over the past two years. At the same time it should be borne in mind that 99.5% of the country's 7.7 million cattle pass the TB test each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Veterinary opinion both here and in the United Kingdom is that TB infected badgers are a major constraint to TB eradication. For this reason I have arranged for the effect of badger removal on TB levels in cattle to be studied in detail. The east Offaly badger removal project has been in place for some time and further research commenced in four area experimental projects in parts of Cork North, Donegal, Kilkenny and Monaghan in 1997. I have also arranged for a number of initiatives in areas where disease levels are particularly high. Herds in these areas are <Col N="1103" /> being subjected to a more intensive testing regime in addition to the annual round test of each and every herd.</P>
    <P>As regards brucellosis, following a period when the incidence was relatively stable, the position deteriorated from 1996. To address the problem I introduced a series of measures during 1997 and at the beginning of 1998. These included more frequent milk ring testing, annual blood testing of all eligible cattle, a compulsory 30 day pre-movement test and movement restrictions on foot of tests. These measures were retained for 1999 and at the beginning of November 5.24 million blood samples had been tested. In addition, a range of operational/administrative measures were introduced aimed at improving the operation and delivery of the brucellosis eradication programme.</P>
    <P>This year I introduced a number of further initiatives, including the screening of cows at factories, improved arrangements in respect of the milk ring test regime, a review of laboratory testing procedures and wider contiguous monitoring <Col N="1104" /> of herds. The current regime was reviewed during 1999 by an EU veterinary mission, which broadly endorsed the measures in place and being introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>The full impact of the new measures is still being evaluated but already there are some signs that the position is improving. For example, the testing regime up to 26 November 1999 identified a significantly lower number of laboratory positive animals at 4,421 compared with 6,251 for the same period in 1998. There have also been fewer new herd breakdowns to the end of October 1999 compared with the corresponding period in 1998. Nevertheless, the disease level remains far too high and it is essential that we continue to make rapid further progress and the objective has to be eradication of the disease in the shortest possible timescale. If we properly implement the current arrangements it will be possible to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>The arrangements to be applied from next year onwards for both schemes will be discussed in the animal health forum which is representative of farmer and veterinary interests shortly.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree this is the greatest national scandal since the foundation of the State? In two years there has been a major increase in cases reported to the Department. Has the Minister any plans to address this problem? Does he think the vested interests in this major industry are doing enough about the problem or do they not want it to be resolved? What is happening to farmers is wrong. They are still paying because of this problem and we are <Col N="1105" /> no further down the road in terms of addressing it since the foundation of the State. Furthermore, what is the Minister doing about research into the badger problem? How many staff are working on this area in his Department? That problem is getting worse, not better, and it is costing taxpayers and the farming community a fortune.</P>

      <P>In relation to what the Deputy said about the cost to the Exchequer, that matter is becoming serious, as I have said often in this House. On a bright note, the Deputy's question is of a statistical nature. I can give him all the statistics now but I would prefer to give them to him after Question Time. On the question of TB, the position at the beginning of the year appeared difficult; there were a large number of breakdowns as against the same period in 1998. The latter end of the year appears fairly progressive with 800 fewer reactors with a marginal increase in the percentage of reactors to the test &ndash; 4.1% viz. 4.2%. Both areas are looking brighter.</P>
      <P>On the brucellosis front, net restricted herds at 1 December 1999 were 252. The number of reactor animals was 4,421 this year while the number for the same period last year was 6,200. There is a fairly substantial decrease in that area. I do not want to tell the Deputy that everything in the garden is rosy but this represents a favourable trend, small though it may be. It is the first time we have seen a trend in that direction and it is heartening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree because 4,000 is a massive number of reactors. How can they resolve this problem in the North but we cannot resolve it here? We can put people on the moon but we cannot resolve this problem which is costing the State a fortune. Has the staff dealing with this problem in the Department increased or decreased over the past number of years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no collapse in cattle prices this year. While cattle prices in the early part of this year were below 1998 levels because of increased supplies of cattle, continuing difficulties on the Russian market and substantial competition from sales of beef out of intervention, the situation has now improved. Throughout the autumn cattle prices have remained relatively firm and, in recent weeks, they have begun to move ahead of last year's levels. In addition, there has been an orderly and high level of disposals of cattle during the year. For example, to date the level of cattle throughput at meat plants has increased by over 200,000 head, a 12% increase, and there has been substantial growth in live cattle exports which are running two and a half times higher than last year. Taken together, disposals are 25% up on last year. I expect those prices to remain firm for the rest of this year. The market has been helped by the reduction in beef production in the European Union and by the appreciation of the dollar against the euro, as well as the stable export refund environment.</P>
      <P>The overall situation on the beef market is reasonably satisfactory, particularly in view of the substantial increase in export slaughterings this year, which has resulted in a record level of commercial beef exports. At the same time, there is scope for further strengthening of prices, particularly in view of the fact that EU intervention stocks have been virtually eliminated, thereby removing a strong source of competition for Irish beef exports. In addition, cattle supplies in Ireland are likely to be significantly reduced next year because of the reduction in cow numbers and the high levels of weanling exports this year.</P>
      <P>Cattle prices, while supported through the EU beef regime, are ultimately determined by market forces and, in particular, the availability of market outlets. There is evidence that Irish exporters are beginning to recover some of the markets lost as a result of BSE and the subsequent renationalisation of markets. There has been a creditable performance on the part of the Irish beef industry this year in securing increased sales to the Netherlands, France and Italy. Exports to third countries are also expected to be somewhat higher than in 1998. The recently renegotiated removal of the Russian ban on beef for five counties should help to increase trade to Russia next year. Exports have also recently commenced to Indonesia and there are reasonable prospects for exports to Turkey, Jordan, Tunisia and Syria. With the support of An Bord Bia, I will use every opportunity to ensure that the industry is in a position to exploit the market opportunities for beef that exist in the European Union and third countries.</P>

      <P>I find the tone and the content of the Minister's reply extraordinary at a time when the CSO report today mentions a collapse in farm incomes of 13.3%, or 20% over two years. The Minister does not appear to be in touch with reality. In the context of last week's budget, £150 million could be found in a day to resolve the botched job in relation to stay at home spouses, yet only £4.2 million was specifically earmarked for the agricultural community by way of VAT refunds. Will the Minister accept that a decrease of 20% in farm incomes is nothing short of a betrayal of the farming community by him? In the context of the request made by the IFA as late as yesterday for a rescue package of £150 million, will the Minister be in a position to deliver something tangible to those farmers? Talking about thousands of tonnes of beef and hundreds of thousands of cattle being exported means nothing to the farmers who are not getting a fair price for their product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative enterprises scheme was operated by my Department as a diversification measure under the Operational Programme for <Col N="1109" /> Agriculture and Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99. Under the scheme, grant aid was available for farmers and rural dwellers for housing and handling facilities for horses, deer, goats, rabbits and other species where a specific need was identified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has enough trouble with Councillor Murphy on the march.</P>
      <P>The scheme also provided for grants towards the cost of deer breeding stock. Over 3,000 enterprises have been grant-aided amounting to almost £12 million, representing investment of over £30 million. I am conscious of the importance of this scheme for the development of alternative on and off-farm activities in rural areas in order to help to maintain viability of the rural population. An allocation of some £12 million is proposed for the years 2000-06 for the reintroduction of a further scheme. The detailed terms and conditions of the new scheme are currently under consideration.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. What is the trend with alternative enterprises? Did they taper off towards the end of the 1994-99 term or did they experience growth? What other aspects of alternative enterprises does he feel have the scope for employment and income generation in rural areas? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme was introduced in December 1994 and some 4,400 applications had been received by 4 October 1996 when the scheme was terminated because demand for the scheme exceeded the available funds. Leader funding was then used instead, particularly in the horticultural area. There was a serious level of take-up on the scheme, particularly in the sport horse production area in which some £9,510,000 was expended. Deer accounted for £1,998,000, goats accounted for £19,386 and I am glad to note that £203,000 was expended on greyhounds. The total expenditure was £11,721,000 million. The scheme was extremely popular although, unfortunately, there was not a sufficiency of funds. We used funds from other areas to assist development in these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the £12 million outlined in the national development plan indicative funding? I am concerned that there would be sufficient moneys throughout the lifetime of the plan to meet the demands of worthwhile projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The £12 million funding is available but the funding may have to be reviewed at an early stage of the plan. We will be dependent on the conditions set down by the EU which is becoming increasingly strict in regard to applications and is seeking more innovative and sustainable projects. The new Leader programme is also due to be introduced which will comprise two <Col N="1110" /> specific parts &ndash; Leader Plus, which the EU has stipulated must be innovative, and the old Leader scheme for which approximately £110 million will be provided. That money will supplement the scheme's funding.</P>

      <P>Producer organisations are recognised and approved under EU regulations. Council Regulation (EC) No. 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 is the current regulation which, <i>inter alia</i>, provides for the establishment of producer organisations. In the past five years, 13 producer organisations have been granted official recognition, six in 1998 and seven in 1999. Eleven of the groups are engaged in the production of mushrooms, one in fruit and the other in fruit and vegetables.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that these figures are quite disappointing and that where producers can come together and share overheads, it leads to better income, organisation of their markets, better quality and a longer season for their customers? Has the Minister any further initiatives in mind which would encourage producers to work together in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy's comments. There is strength in numbers for producers &ndash; the Dublin-Meath Growers Association is the best example of that. Three years ago, it was not possible to get the association going, but growers have since succeeded in doing that. Cork has been one of the most disappointing areas. There is disagreement there among many producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have greater influence with some of the people to whom I refer. It offers strength and price control to producers to come together. The advent of the new supermarkets which are coming into the country has created the urgency for that kind of initiative.</P>
      <P>We are discussing operational programmes submitted by seven of the producer organisations, which were officially recognised earlier this year. We are looking to further expand them and to try to do something with them. Six groups were recognised in 1998 and submitted operational programmes which will be implemented in 1999. They are eligible for community assistance in respect of those programmes in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are encouraging more people to get involved. I know there are carrot growers and other producers in the Deputy's constituency and <Col N="1112" /> if they joined together to form a producer group, they would save on transport, supply and so on. It would give them real strength in terms of the control of prices and they could not be bullied or divided.</P>

      <P>There have been disallowances for Ireland and other member states in respect of FEOGA guarantee. Disallowances for Ireland amounted to 0.5% over the period.

    <P>The Commission has closed the accounts for the year up to 1995.

The results of those inquiries for all member states should be available next year.</P>
    <P>Looking at the period overall, Ireland's performance was particularly good up to the late 1980s and early 1990s when systems came under <Col N="1114" /> stress at a time of collapse in the beef market. However, since then, there has been a steady improvement, particularly in export refunds which has recorded no penalties for several years and beef intervention.</P>

      <P>Recently, the Minister announced that an average of £13,000 per farm was paid by way of EU transfers. In the same press release, he indicated that because farmers had an outside income, farming was going well. It was the most remarkable statement I have heard from Agriculture House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They were minimal disallowances at any rate. As I said, disallowances for Ireland amounted to 0.5% over the period which compared more than favourably with other member states  &ndash; we are one of the better performing member states. I will circulate a table with the reply which will give the Deputy details of the disallowances. Since 1973 Ireland, as a member state, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, have been exemplary as a paying agent of the EU, and it is subject to EU audit through the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. Ireland's performance has been quite outstand<Col N="1115" /> ing, the details of which I will circulate to all Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I will circulate a detailed table. Ireland's major disallowances were in the beef intervention area, for example, and more recently there have been some problems, but on a smaller scale, in relation to some of the premium schemes under which there were disallowances. There were disallowances under the suckler cow, early retirement and area aid schemes but at a very low level. Intervention was the largest area but there were also disallowances in some of the farm schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 55 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The World Trade Organisation held a ministerial conference in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999 with the aim of defining the scope of the new round of trade negotiations. The conference was adjourned without reaching agreement and without a date being set for its resumption. However, under the terms of the Uruguay Round agreement on agriculture, concluded in 1994 under the auspices of GATT, the WTO's predecessor, WTO members are committed to resuming negotiations for the continuation of the trade liberalisation process in agriculture this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement on agriculture recognised the long-term objective of progressive reductions in support and protection resulting in fundamental reform as an ongoing process. The agreement also recognised that negotiations on that objec<Col N="1116" /> tive would have to take into account the experience and effects of implementing commitments agreed in 1994, non-trade concerns, special and differential treatment of developing countries and the objective to create a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system.</P>
    <P>Ireland will be participating in WTO negotiations on agriculture as a member of the European Union. The EU has been preparing its position for those negotiations on agriculture for some time and I have been actively involved in that process. The EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999 adopted its position for the negotiations which declared, among other things, that the EU's policy in the negotiations would be based on the full Agenda 2000 package decided by the Heads of Government at the European Council in Berlin in March 1999. I will be working to ensure that the position adopted by Council, based on the Agenda 2000 outcome, is upheld.</P>
    <P>It is virtually impossible at this stage to predict with any reliability the outcome of the negotiations or the implications for the agri-food sector and, indeed, any attempt to do so publicly would prejudice our negotiating position.</P>
    <P>One of my objectives in the negotiations will be to ensure that there will be sufficient access to third country markets to provide adequate and remunerative outlets for Irish meat products. As recommended in the Report of the Beef Task Force, it is essential that the beef industry exploits fully the market opportunities that exist within the European Union and my Department and an Bord Bia will avail of every opportunity to promote that approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply, but concerns have been expressed to me that when the next summit takes place, agricultural interests need to have the senior Minister, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development present so that what they term as an attack on the European family farm structure can be resisted at that level. Will the Minister attend the next summit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These agriculture negotiations are taken by the EU as a whole. Before the EU took that position, we laid down the brief or terms of reference for the negotiations at the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September. The position was that negotiations should take place based on the outcome of the Agenda 2000 talks and that the European model of agriculture, which is also the Irish model, should be retained. The individual Ministers representing countries are the trade Ministers, while Commissioner Fischler represents the European Union. Given that agriculture is so important to Ireland, I ensured that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, was fully briefed and I met him and his senior officials several times before he went to the Seattle talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> If I had gone to Seattle there would not have been a position there for me or for any other Agriculture Minister. No other Agriculture Minister from a member state participated in the Seattle talks. I will continue to ensure that the position of Irish agriculture is upheld and if there is a position for me at any future meeting, I will go. However, I will ensure that Ireland's representatives at such talks will be unflinching in support of the EU position, which is also the Irish position, as outlined in the 27 September meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister confident that the Agenda 2000 conclusions, which he negotiated so successfully, will not be affected? Is he confident the family farm will not be affected after these talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The most effective way of ensuring a successful outcome that will help Ireland's position is to protect two areas. One is the area of export refunds. We need those because we are an exporting country; we export to the EU and to third countries. The second area to be protected is the &ldquo;Blue Box&rdquo;. That must be maintained and must not be diluted. Retention of the &ldquo;Blue Box&rdquo; means direct payment or cheques in the post are retained also.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputy Brady that these two areas will be unflinchingly protected in the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had direct contact with his counterpart in America about the WTO talks? There is a wide difference between what the Americans want, what the CAIRNS group wants and what we want. What political contacts has the Minister made in this regard? We want to retain our export refunds and the &ldquo;Blue Box&rdquo;, as the Minister said, but the European model of the family farm is being attacked all over the world.</P>

The Taoiseach and other Ministers put Ireland's case &ndash; that agriculture is more important to Ireland than to other member states &ndash; when they meet their counterparts and other heads of State. America and the CAIRNS group are seeking to dilute the importance of export refunds and the &ldquo;Blue Box&rdquo;, the two important areas to us. I accept the Deputy's point that it is important that we, representing the country in Government, ensure that every possible bilateral meeting and contact with other Governments are availed of to emphasise our position. We must ensure that the Seattle round of talks turns out to be favourable <Col N="1118" /> to Ireland, as the Uruguay round did, as there is not much point in negotiating a position in Europe and having it diluted at the WTO talks.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that no other country in the world stands to lose more in these talks, proportionately, than Ireland, as a large net exporter of agricultural produce? We are dealing with countries even within the EU that are net importers of agricultural produce, so they do not have the same stake in this as we do. It is imperative to have a high-powered delegation at these talks. Commissioner Fischler may be very competent, but he does not necessarily have our interests at heart in these talks. We have seen the havoc the importation of New Zealand lamb is causing in European markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the European market is opened to countries outside the EU, there is no great future for agriculture in this country. Is it not important that we have a strong team from Ireland at those talks and that we do not have to depend on the EU to fight our case? Their case may not be our case; it is not in our interests to have the EU negotiate for us on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says. Agricultural exports are more important to our economy than to any other State. The Deputy will know that we export to approximately 70 countries worldwide, not just to the EU, so we are hugely dependent on export outlets. I reiterate that the EU negotiating position was drawn up at the meeting of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September, when a unanimous negotiating position was agreed. The reason the Seattle talks broke up was that the EU, including Ireland, would not accept the talks agenda, as it was outside the EU's terms of reference. I want to ensure that Ireland's dependence on agriculture is secure in those talks. However, there was no possible role for any Agriculture Minister in Seattle and no EU Agriculture Minister participated. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was represented by one of its most senior negotiating officials and I was in constant contact with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, during the negotiations. Due to the time difference, some of the calls were made at inappropriate times of the night and morning.</P>
      <P>These negotiations will take up to 2003 and Ireland's position on the agricultural sector will be maintained during the negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Minister has partly answered my question already regarding his attendance at the talks. I accept his point about none of his EU colleagues attending, but, given Deputy Deasy's comments about Ireland's dependence on agriculture, will the Minister reflect on the necessity of being present at some of these nego<Col N="1119" /> tiations? The Government should send the strongest possible signal in this regard and that would best be done by the Minister attending, rather than a Minister of State from another Department, at future phases of talks, particularly when crucial decisions are being made. The Minister might consider attending those meetings.</P>

      <P>Seriously, I have no difficulty with that. I can envisage a role for an agriculture Minister at such talks, if only on the periphery. A Minister's presence would give added weight in highlighting Ireland's concern as a member state. Specifically on the Seattle talks, there was no role for me there, as all that was involved was drawing up the agenda, but when the talks get going I anticipate I will attend the vital and relevant meetings of the WTO.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister assure the House that when the next round of talks are fixed he will be there lobbying for our interests? The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is an urban Deputy, an urban cowboy, and is not really interested in the agriculture scene. I ask the Minister to give an undertaking to attend the next round of talks to put the Irish case. Having listened to Americans during recent months and visited America a few weeks ago, I am aware Americans are not mindful of what is in the best interests of Europe and Ireland. The yanks think big, they do not care much about agriculture here, rather like the Minister and the two Ministers of State. They have not done much for the farmers of this country, particularly pig, sheep and cattle farmers.</P>

The US and the CAIRNS group want to dismantle the measures we want to protect. They want to dismantle and eliminate export refunds and open up the blue box. They have massive support for their industries at primary farmer level and at other levels and on top of that they use various ways of stimulating production, which is not allowed in the EU or Ireland where there is a safe food policy. We want to ensure a proper balance is struck in these talks and the outcome will result in retention of the model of agriculture in the EU and Ireland.</P>

As to the new schemes, we must prepare them and send them to Brussels or the European Commission by the end of this month, following which Brussels have told us the new schemes will be prepared early in the new year. In this context, all I can go on is the speed at which Brussels does its business. We had a classic example of that during the past 12 months when there was a change to the euro on 1 January 1999 and the 5% odd that farmers lost in their early retirement pension benefits and REPS payments has still not been paid. We will submit the schemes to Brussels and I will apply the maximum amount of pressure on the Commission to issue the new schemes. There will be improvements in the two schemes. Farmers are in a dilemma as to whether to join the existing schemes or wait and join the new schemes.</P>

The remaining amount still has to be distributed and the distribution year will be 2001-02. I did not take a decision on its distribution in case anomalies or exceptions might turn up during this year. I will decide with the social partners and the farming organisations during the year how best to distribute it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the new rules &ndash; the breaking of the link with land &ndash; following intensive discussions with the Attorney General's office and the legal services of the European Union in recent months, we are virtually in a position to announce a decision on that.

      <P>The previous question related to the position of resources in the Department for the implementation of schemes. From my experience, I am aware inadequate resources were available in the early 1990s when a range of new schemes were introduced, bottlenecks built up in respect of payments and we had to get derogations from Brussels to make the necessary payments. We had a great number of difficulties. However, we are up to date now and at least approximately 95% go out on time. There is a problem with 2%, 3%, 4% or 5% depending on the scheme. The range of schemes, including the ten and 22 months scheme and the advance and <Col N="1123" /> concluding payments, is complex. Many of the changes were brought about in consultation with the social partners and particularly with the deputy president of the IFA, John Dillon. It is the wish of the farming organisation that payments should be made throughout the year. We are trying to synchronise those and to set deadlines.</P>

      <P>Low literacy levels pose difficulties for citizens in accessing information on and availing of their entitlements. This problem is not unique to the schemes operated by my Department. I and the staff of my Department are aware that low levels of literacy may pose an obstacle to some farmers in establishing the precise requirements of some schemes, but I am not aware that literacy contributes to the occurrence of disallowances or penalties. The matter is being kept under review and if particular initiatives can be identified to assist in this area, which will not compromise financial probity in disbursement of public funds, I will take the necessary action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Analysis of disallowances and penalties incurred over the past four years has shown that the single biggest factor giving rise to penalties is the late submission of applications. The percentage of penalties arising from late submission of applications over this period has ranged from 63.7%, which is 1.4% of total applications, to 79.3%, which is 2.0% of total applications. My Department has been actively involved in recent years in simplifying, as far as possible, the application forms used in connection with the various schemes for direct payments to farmers. Help sheets and checklists, which set out the main <Col N="1124" /> requirements in simple straightforward terms, are also provided to assist in correct completion of application forms. The simplified documentation should be of particular benefit to those with literacy problems.</P>
    <P>The application forms and information leaflets are reviewed annually prior to issue in consultation with the main farming organisations. This has been done under the auspices of the Charter of Rights for Farmers Review Group and will continue to be done, as committed to in my Department's customer service action plan. In the past, reviews have concentrated on simplifying the forms and reducing to a minimum the amount of information required to support an application. Particular attention is paid to matters that gave rise to a significant level of errors or confusions in the previous years applications.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are becoming increasingly involved in participating in information meetings and seminars around the country, in conjunction with the farming organisations, to improve farmer awareness and understanding of scheme requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>This process will be continued and a series of public information meetings to explain the detailed changes arising from the Agenda 2000 package and to answer farmers questions are planned in conjunction with Teagasc, commencing in January. Full details of these meetings will be published in the national and local media. I urge any farmer with literacy difficulties to avail of this opportunity to hear the changes explained and clarified.</P>
    <P>Teagasc has the important remit of providing advisory, educational and training services to farmers and I again urge farmers to use this facility if they have difficulty in understanding the scheme requirements or selecting the options to maximise their entitlements. It is my intention to explore the possibility of Teagasc taking a more active role in advising farmers on scheme requirements.</P>
    <P>I remind any farmers who have difficulty in understanding the requirements of a scheme or in completing an application form that assistance and advice is available from the local offices of my Department. If a farmer needs assistance or clarification of the requirements of a scheme, he or she should not hesitate about contacting their local office where the officials will be only too happy to assist and advise them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the figure quoted in the survey is alarming and gives considerable cause for concern? As he stated, it probably extends to other schemes as well. I have no doubt it extends to the family income supplement where there is less than 50% uptake. The Minister said that many application forms arrive <Col N="1125" /> late. That could also be linked to illiteracy. People are inclined to put things on the long finger which they cannot easily address. Will the Minister ask his officials to help people who have filled in forms incorrectly? Will he ensure they are sent back to the people who applied so they know they have made a mistake and help them to fill them out properly so that they will not be disqualified? Will the Minister set up such a mechanism in the Department? </P>

      <P>This problem manifests itself in different ways, in penalties and disallowances. In many cases, people make innocent errors. They do not set out to defraud the system. The staff of the Department have the best will in the world and they are as helpful as they can possibly be. There is a plethora of complex schemes. More than one million individual payments must be processed each year and there are different deadlines and advance amounts. As regards the REP scheme and the early retirement scheme, spot checks and EU audits are carried out, so everything must be done correctly. One would need additional resources. An EU official addressed one of the statutory committees of the House recently and he said Ireland had one of the most simple forms compared to other member states. I am continuously looking for ways to address this problem. I have asked Teagasc and its advisory network to help out.</P>

      <P>To date this year £669 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU headage and premium schemes, of which more than £416 million relates to payments made under the 1999 schemes. So far, an average of 92% of applicants have been paid across all schemes where payments have commenced.</P>
      <P>Payments under all the schemes are in line with the performance targets set out in the Charter of Rights for Farmers. Ireland's performance in delivering the direct payment schemes is among the best in the EU and compares favourably with that of other member states. For most schemes Ireland is rated between one and five among the 15 member states in terms of early payment in the 1997-98 scheme year. Ireland was first in the arable and ewe premium schemes, third in the suckler cow scheme and fifth in the special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that considerable progress has been made in keeping documentation as simple as possible for these schemes. Application forms and help sheets have been simplified each year in consultation with the farming bodies. In an oral presentation to an all party Oireachtas committee on the strategic management initiative earlier this year, the European Commission indicated that the forms used in Ireland were easier to understand than those used by other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the CSO's figures, direct payments to farmers constituted 56% of farmers' income in 1998 and this proportion is set to increase in the coming years following the successful outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. It is my objective that the improvements in delivery of these payments which have been achieved in recent years will be built on and that the ser<Col N="1127" /> vice provided by my Department to farmers will be efficient, fair, friendly and transparent.</P>
    <P>Since the middle of this year, the Department has been conducting a major review of its IT strategy. This has been done in association with external consultants and I expect to receive the final report soon. The final report will include recommendations for the development of management information systems requirements at a number of levels. These will satisfy most of the operational needs of the individual management units, will allow senior management to develop cross functional views of the organisation's activities and will provide for a greater degree of trend analysis and research capabilities and more sophisticated analysis of data.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to be as helpful as possible. There are two difficulties. There is pressure from farmers, farmers' bodies, TDs and party spokespeople to make the payments as quickly as possible, particularly in the run-up to Christmas. There are, however, procedures involving EU auditors, auditors from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. They are all shouting about the disallowance of 0.01% and what we are doing about that. We must be accountable but at the same time we must be swift in processing and delivering. Because direct payments make up such a high percentage of farmers' incomes, the major challenge which faces any Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is the delivery of an efficient, friendly and fair system.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, I wish to report on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, to the House <Col N="1129" /> on Irish military participation in United Nations missions in 1998. I am pleased to take this opportunity to put before the House an account of the proud contribution made by members of the Defence Forces in the various UN missions throughout the world.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer first to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon &ndash; UNIFIL &ndash; which is our largest single overseas commitment and which has been much to the fore in the light of the tragic killing earlier this year of Private Billy Kedian who was serving with the 85th Irish Battalion. I will give a brief outline of the situation obtaining this year. As will be recalled, the Taoiseach, during the course of his visit to the Middle East from 17 to 21 January 1999, visited the troops serving with UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>The situation in the UNIFIL area of operations was extremely tense in the earlier part of this year, resulting in an increased incidence of firings close to IRISHBATT positions. Firing close is the term used by UNIFIL to describe firing by any weapon that results in the impact of rounds or shrapnel near or close to a United Nations position, vehicle or persons. The most serious incident occurred on 31 May 1999 when UNIFIL Post 6-42 came under attack resulting in the death of Private William Kedian and the critical wounding of Private Ronald Rushe. All Members will join with me in again expressing the sympathy of the House to the family of Private Kedian and in wishing Private Rushe continued progress in his recovery to health.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Defence, visited the area from 20 to 22 June 1999 in order to see for himself the situation on the ground and, more importantly, to raise the seriousness of the prevailing security situation in the UNIFIL area of operation with both the Israeli and Lebanese authorities and to seek assurances that the reckless shelling of IRISHBATT positions by the Israeli Defence Force-De Facto Forces &ndash; IDF-DFF &ndash; which undoubtedly led to the death of Private Kedian would not recur. During the course of the visit, he met the Israeli Minister of Defence and also the Lebanese Minister of Defence, the latter in relation to ongoing hostile activity by the armed elements, Hizbollah. He sought assurances from both that there would not be a recurrence of the recent serious shelling incidents as well as other hostile activity. He indicated to both sides that, while Ireland is committed to the UNIFIL mission, where Defence Forces personnel have served since 1978, should there not be a cessation of such incidents, serious consideration would have to be given to the withdrawal of the Irish contingent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the weeks following the death of Private Kedian, while there was a general decrease in the number of firings close to Irish positions, there was a number of further serious incidents, including the dropping of a bomb from an Israeli air <Col N="1130" /> force jet several hundred metres from an Irish position as well as a direct mortar hit within an IRISHBATT post. In the latter incident it was most fortunate that there was no loss of life.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to 1998, the subject of this report. During 1998 the Irish Battalion continued to carry out its mission by operating observation posts and checkpoints, by conducting extensive patrolling, maintaining a village presence and providing humanitarian assistance to a variety of worthy causes such as Tibnin orphanage and medical clinics in the local villages.</P>
    <P>For most of 1998 the contingent strength was 610, consisting of a battalion of 531 personnel and 79 personnel at UNIFIL headquarters. Eight other countries besides Ireland continued to participate in UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>During 1998 hostilities continued between the Israeli Defence Forces and its local Lebanese auxiliary, the De Facto Forces &ndash; DFF &ndash; on the one hand and armed elements who have proclaimed their resistance against the Israeli occupation on the other. The level of hostilities was higher in the latter half of the year. The armed elements employed small arms, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank missiles, recoilless rifles, rockets and explosive devices. They fired approximately 1,500 mortar rounds, rockets and anti-tank missiles during the reporting period. IDF-DFF, in response to attacks or in operations which they themselves initiated, employed artillery, mortars, tanks, helicopter gunships, fixed-wing aircraft and explosive devices. UNIFIL recorded more than 4,400 rounds of artillery, mortar, tank and missiles fired by IDF-DFF during 1998.</P>
    <P>UNIFIL continued its efforts to limit the conflict and to protect the local inhabitants from the fighting. Through its network of checkpoints and observations posts and an active programme of patrolling as well as continuous contacts with the parties, the force did its best to prevent its area of operations from being used for hostile activities and to defuse situations that could lead to escalation. It also deployed, as necessary, to provide a measure of protection to villages and to farmers working in the fields.</P>
    <P>During the year the Department of Foreign Affairs allocated £40,000 to IRISHBATT in respect of the provision of humanitarian assistance in the area. The main project which the Irish Battalion has been associated with is the orphanage in Tibnin. The orphanage was set up in 1975 and accommodates 77 children aged between five and 14.</P>
    <P>During 1998 there was no significant change in the overall political situation and consequently the level of operational activity remained high. The armed elements continued to mount attacks regularly and in an unpredictable pattern. IDF losses were significant and these losses prompted heavy retaliation, thus continuing the cycle of <Col N="1131" /> violence. These attacks by armed elements and the Israeli Defence Force resulted in a large number of firings close to IRISHBATT positions and these were protested through UNIFIL headquarters to the Israeli authorities through the normal channels and as appropriate to United Nations headquarters New York.</P>
    <P>It is our earnest hope that the renewed Middle East peace process will reach a successful outcome and that the day will soon be in prospect when UNIFIL will have fulfilled its mission and the deployment of the force will no longer be necessary. The recent agreement between President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak on implementation of the Wye Memorandum and on the opening of final status negotiations marks a new and more hopeful phase in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The new Israeli Government declared its intention to withdraw its forces from Lebanon within a year. The legal situation is that UN Security Council Resolution 425 of 1978 requires Israel to end its presence in southern Lebanon. If this is to be achieved, the attitude adopted by Hizbollah and other armed Lebanese elements to the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army and to Israel will be critical.</P>
    <P>There is, however, an ongoing risk of an escalation of attacks against the South Lebanese Army in the area as part of a final push to ensure that the withdrawal is effected. This scenario may call for the possibility of a revision of the role of UNIFIL in a post-withdrawal situation. Developments, and in particular the evolving situation in the peace process overall, will be monitored closely in terms of their influence on the possible future role for UNIFIL in the re-establishment of Lebanese sovereignty over its territory mandated by the UN. I might also mention that Brigadier General James Sreenan was appointed Deputy Force Commander, UNIFIL, in May of this year.</P>
    <P>During 1998, Ireland provided 30 military personnel to the United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus, UNFICYP &ndash; six officers and 24 NCOs served with the contingent. Three officers and five NCOs filled staff appointments at force headquarters, with a camp command component of three officers and 19 NCOs. The mandate for the force is &ldquo;To use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting and, as necessary, to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The principal task of UNFICYP is the maintenance of a buffer zone between the line of the Cypriot National Guard and the Turkish-Cypriot forces. Since October 1999, the number of personnel on this mission has been reduced to five, in line with a strength reduction programme being implemented by the UN. UNFICYP recommended that the Irish contingent be reduced to 14 all ranks by the middle of 1999. The further reduction was decided on in the context of a <Col N="1132" /> rebalancing of the Defence Forces' overseas commitments.</P>
    <P>In July 1997 the House approved participation by the Defence Forces in the Stabilisation Force-Bosnia Herzegovina, SFOR. This mission is NATO led but operates under a United Nations Security Council mandate. During 1998 the Defence Forces contribution comprised a military police contingent of 50 personnel. The contingent forms part of the international military police company at SFOR headquarters in Sarajevo. A liaison officer is based at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, SHAPE, in Mons, Belgium. In June 1999 the Government approved continued participation by the Defence Forces in SFOR for a further period of 12 months to June 2000.</P>
    <P>The experience of the Defence Forces to date in this mission has been very positive. Thankfully, there have been no serious incidents involving Irish personnel in SFOR except for the unfortunate incident on 28 April 1999 when Corporal Lorraine Coss sustained shrapnel injuries arising from an explosion at Ilidza Camp, SFOR headquarters, where she was on guard duty. The explosion occurred while a local civilian was attempting to lower into a protective bunker outside the camp some unexploded mines which he had retrieved. Corporal Coss returned to duty on 31 May 1998.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East, UNTSO, is 11 officers. We have participated in this mission since 1958. Our UNTSO observers are currently based in Israel, Syria and Lebanon. UNTSO's main tasks today are concerned with the conflict between Israel and Lebanon and Israel and Syria working closely with UNIFIL and UNDOF, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force. It also maintains a presence in Egypt, although this front is generally quiet.</P>
    <P>The UNDOF mission began in 1974 following the ceasefire in the Golan Heights between Israel and Syria. Its mission is to use its best efforts to maintain the ceasefire and to see that it is scrupulously observed. Lieutenant General David Stapleton, now Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, served as Force Commander of UNDOF from June 1997 until August 1998. No other members of the Defence Forces served with this mission during 1998 or have since served.</P>
    <P>Ireland had one officer serving in the United Nations Military Observers Prevlaka, UNMOP, mission during 1998. He was based in Dubrovnik. Under the terms of the Dayton Agreement this mission monitors the demilitarisation of the Prevlaka Peninsula and ensure freedom of movement into and out of Kotor Bay. An officer continues to serve there.</P>
    <P>The system known as the United Nations Standby Arrangement is intended to enhance the <Col N="1133" /> United Nations' capacity for rapid response to emergency situations. On 15 October 1998, my colleague, the Minister for Defence, signed, on behalf of Ireland, a Memorandum of Understanding with the UN in relation to Defence Forces participation in UNSAS. Participation in UNSAS does not involve an obligation to participate in any particular mission and, as at present, Dáil approval will be required for the dispatch of a contingent of the Defence Forces to specific operation. The decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the considerable undertaking which it represents in financial and personnel terms, the Government remains committed, with due regard to the safety of our troops, to the principle of military participation in UN peacekeeping operations in the cause of international peace. While no guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in any mission overseas, it is policy to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are adequately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. In this regard my colleague the Minister for Defence is satisfied that the role of Defence Forces personnel serving overseas is in keeping with their training and experience to date. There was no loss of life or serious injury suffered by Irish personnel serving in the missions mentioned during the year under report, that is 1998. I mentioned earlier the injury suffered by Corporal Lorraine Coss while serving with SFOR.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to build on a long tradition of service to the founding principles of the UN by making practical commitments of personnel on a continuing basis. As well as the extensive involvement of Irish military personnel in UN peacekeeping operations, a number of senior military officers have, down the years, served with distinction in senior appointments in UN missions. As I mentioned earlier, Lieutenant General David Stapleton served as Force Commander of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in Syria from June 1997 to August 1998. Brigadier General James Sreenan was appointed earlier this year as Deputy Force Commander, UNIFIL and Brigadier General John Vize took up appointment on 1 December 1999 as Force Commander of UNIKOM, United Nations Iraq/Kuwait Observer Mission. These appointments bring prestige and honour not only to the Defence Forces but to the country.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all those members of the Defence Forces who have served and who continue to serve on UN peacekeeping missions. I also pay tribute to the members of An Garda Síochána for the excellent contribution which that force makes to the cause of international peace by their participation in overseas missions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> Ireland's willingness to participate in missions is motivated as much by a firm belief in the moral obligation which rests on the shoulders of the international community to support the UN in its tireless efforts in conflict prevention and peacekeeping in troubled spots as by our sense of outrage at the infliction of suffering on our fellow human beings. Above all, it is motivated by our firm conviction that we must stand beside other nations who respond and play our part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to hear the outline of the work of the Defence Forces in peacekeeping operations in 1998 and I thank the Minister of State. If we are to continue this proud tradition it is critical that the Government White Paper on Defence should be published immediately. The Taoiseach should confirm to the House that the strength of the Defence Forces will be maintained at the current level of 11,500. The Defence Forces need to be maintained at this level if we are to continue the record of service which the Minister has outlined in the report. He has outlined our contribution in Lebanon, Cyprus, Kosovo, East Timor and in many other countries. If we are to continue this service it is essential that there is clarity regarding Defence Forces numbers. Recent reports about a reduction in the strength of the Defence Forces place a serious question mark over our ability to play a full role in such missions in the future. Of that there is no doubt. Rumours that the Department of Finance is aiming to reduce numbers to 10,700 have been allowed to circulate unchecked. The Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Stapleton, has already made it clear that any reduction in the bottom-line figure of 11,500 would mean we could not meet our commitments abroad. It is very unfortunate that the White Paper has become a vehicle to play a numbers game as opposed to charting an appropriate defence policy for the future.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to praise the work of the Defence Forces abroad and they should be praised. However, we must look at the background against which the Minister comes to the House to outline the work of the Defence Forces. It is a background of unchecked rumours about the future of the Defence Forces and a lack of implementation of the Price Waterhouse report on the future of the Navy and Air Corps. The Minister's praise means very little if he does not give a strong and consistent message to the Defence Forces. Our praise for their work abroad must be balanced by appropriate support and confidence in them and in Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should be very clear about the numbers in the Defence Forces. If he does not agree to the number of 11,500 he will have failed the Defence Forces and the country's reputation internationally. The consequences of a decision to reduce the numbers below that level could be <Col N="1135" /> very serious within the Defence Forces. I call on the Minister and the Taoiseach to intervene to ensure that the bottom-line figure is maintained and we are allowed to continue the proud tradition the Minister has outlined. The prevarication should stop now because it undermines the morale of the Defence Forces, it affects our international peace keeping and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are one of the most analysed groups in the country. There have been three internal audit group reports. There has been agreement to reduce numbers from 14,500 to 11,500. This dramatic reduction has been implemented over a period of three years. It has been achieved through voluntary early retirement and natural wastage. The Defence Forces can be very proud of the way this change has been managed. However, to use the White Paper as a further opportunity to reduce numbers is outrageous, particularly as the Government has agreed to our participation in Partnership for Peace. We have entered Partnership for Peace and have signed up for the Petersberg Tasks which will make demands on our Defence Forces. Yet, we allow uncertainty about Defence Forces numbers to continue. This is not satisfactory and is very damaging.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I pay tribute to the members of the Defence Forces who have served overseas. One cannot talk about this work without referring to the tragic death of private Kedian and the injury to private Ronald Rushe. Everyone joins the Minister in expressing sympathy to the family of private Kedian and good wishes to private Rushe who is making a recovery.</P>
    <P>Having seen the work in Lebanon I know we do not appreciate sufficiently the dangerous situations in which our troops often find themselves, the great difficulties they must surmount and the discipline they bring to their work. It is good to see that more and more people are visiting our Defence Forces abroad. I welcome the visit of the Taoiseach to the troops. The visit by the select committee was the first by a committee of the House to the troops in Lebanon. It is important they are aware of the appreciation that is felt in the House for their work abroad. They are tremendous ambassadors for the country and are in the service of peace keeping which is becoming more and more important in the world. The need for peace keeping and enforcement has never been so great and I say that with a degree of regret because of the great amount of conflict in the world. The conditions faced by our troops in Kosovo are quite difficult. I recently spoke to some people who were involved in that mission and I know they are facing difficult conditions. They must provide security for a population under threat and help them survive with very <Col N="1136" /> basic living standards and in very difficult circumstances. This is not an easy task but it is one which the Irish people are glad to see our troops undertaking.</P>
    <P>It would be hard to speak today without referring to the massacre of the innocents in Chechnya which we have seen on our TV screens in recent days. It seems as if Russian forces are remorselessly pouring tons of high explosives on the Chechnyans and have delivered a &ldquo;get out or die&rdquo; ultimatum to the unfortunate people of Grozny, leaving unspecified just how they are to achieve safe passage through the barrage of high explosives that is reducing their city to smouldering rubble. This puts into stark relief the difficulties faced by some people in the world today and highlights the importance of training, preparing, educating and supporting our Defence Forces to be part of the solution of these conflicts. It is clear that the conflicts that our troops are helping to deal with have almost all been intra-state conflicts. Most conflicts of the past decade have been internal and we have seen the collapse of civic society in many of these situations. It is important that the vacuum that is filled in these conflict situations should not be filled by private quasi-militias who are not accountable to anybody. If we do not have proper peace keeping this will happen.</P>
    <P>The easy availability of arms feeds these conflicts. Arms are available very cheaply. A machine gun which can wreak havoc on a civilian population can be bought for $15. It is important that we play a role in security through international peacekeeping. It is good to see the UN attempting to tackle the arms issue as well.</P>
    <P>If Ireland is to maintain its reputation as a responsible member of the international community it must ensure that it makes good the deficits in investment in our national defence infrastructure. It is clear that the resources of the Defence Forces are inadequate to continue its work in international peacekeeping. The recent order by the Minister for APCs will be of assistance but that will take some time to come on stream. We should do more to equip the Defence Forces adequately for peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has long argued for providing enhanced logistical, signals, police, transport and medical support to peacekeeping operations. It is most important to ensure that the units we despatch are adequately resourced. As peacekeeping work changes, it is clear that the defence forces which contribute will have to bring their own equipment and be adequately resourced. The international community will not resource peacekeeping units. They will have to be resourced and that means a further commitment from the State. Sometimes we are a little ambivalent about this. On the one hand we claim that we wish to take part in peacekeeping and that we are proud of our peacekeeping record while on <Col N="1137" /> the other hand there is reluctance to equip the Defence Forces properly to do the tasks demanded of them.</P>
    <P>Ireland should have been able to send more troops to Kosovo. We should have sent more than just a transport unit even though we had to borrow the lorries to train the members of the unit before they departed. That is not good enough. We must be able to give a greater commitment. We must deal with shortages in the medical and engineering sections because the greatest demand abroad is for these specialist services. Equally, we must continue Defence Forces training in human rights. When our troops leave these areas they wish to leave a strong legacy of protection of human rights. We should highlight the importance of human rights in development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the start that has been made in resourcing the Defence Forces for future missions in support of civic society. However, it is not enough simply to provide such basic and long overdue equipment as the recently contracted APCs. We need a vision for the future of the Defence Forces and that vision should be given realistic support. We must remove the doubt and uncertainty hanging over the Defence Forces at present with regard to the total numbers. This is the least we owe our international peacekeepers.</P>
    <P>We should not assume that the continued rumour, innuendo and comment about reducing numbers does not have an effect on those serving abroad. It has a most demoralising effect. It has a demoralising effect on members offering to go abroad to carry out international peacekeeping. This must be addressed immediately by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by this short debate on the annual reports under section 4 of the 1993 Act to pay tribute to the men and women of the Defence Forces who have given such loyal and dedicated service to the United Nations in trouble spots throughout the world and who daily put their safety and lives at risk in the cause of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald said, there are major problems in relation to morale in the Defence Forces due to uncertainty about the numbers being dictated by the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance. In debating these reports and paying tribute to the troops it would be wrong not to acknowledge that the debate is taking place against the background of a serious crisis of morale in the Defence Forces. There is the ongoing controversy about Army deafness claims, for which the Minister must accept a great share of the blame, delays in dealing with re-equipping, continuing dissatisfaction with pay and conditions, the failure to produce the long promised White Paper, uncertainty about the status of recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report <Col N="1138" /> and reports from the Department of Finance which seek to reduce Defence Forces personnel by 3,000.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to imagine how we are to maintain our status as peacekeepers if the Defence Forces are to be reduced by 3,000, as demanded by the Department of Finance. It is not feasible that the Department of Defence accept it. The Minister and the Taoiseach should rectify this problem as a matter of urgency. On many occasions, particularly during Question Time, I have asked the Minister about his contacts with the representative bodies, PDFORRA and RACO. It appears that it is only when the Minister wishes to put something forward that he meets with either representative body. He does not meet them to find out about ongoing problems in the Defence Forces. His Department officials conduct such meetings. The Minister is responsible for morale in the Defence Forces and I cannot understand why there are not regular meetings between him and the two representative bodies.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the report for 1998 was not available in the Oireachtas Library until lunchtime today. This is a report for a period that ended almost 12 months ago. This debate was sought by the Minister for Defence last week and was agreed by the Whips yet Deputies still did not have access to the report until a few hours before the debate started. No fault attaches to the staff of the Library. This is the responsibility of the Minister and the House is due an explanation and an apology.</P>
    <P>Twice in the past year the House has sanctioned the participation of Irish troops in new operations &ndash; in Kosovo and East Timor. The locations in which Irish troops are serving listed in the report is a list of the trouble spots of the world. Some are places where trouble has erupted only in recent years, such as the former Yugoslavia or East Timor. Others are places where there have been long running and unresolved disputes, such as Cyprus and the Middle East. Others are locations where the problems may have slipped from the front pages of the newspapers, such as Afghanistan or Kuwait, but where the presence of UN observers is crucial to the maintenance of peace.</P>
    <P>It is 40 years since Irish troops first went abroad to serve with the United Nations. For a small country, Ireland has made an enormous contribution. Almost 10% of our personnel are serving abroad. Ireland is the sixth largest provider of troops to UN peace missions. In the course of four decades this country has paid a high price in terms of the commitment of both financial resources and personnel to the pursuit of world peace. However, this pales into insignificance compared to the price paid by the Defence Forces personnel who were killed or injured in the course of these operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> The area that has taken the greatest toll in terms of personnel and casualties is the Lebanon. It is more than 20 years since UNIFIL was established and tens of thousands of Irish troops have served there in the intervening period. The details in the report about the death of Private William Kedian last May and the injuries sustained by Privates Rush and Clarke in the same incident and the death of Sergeant John Lynch and the serious injury sustained by Private Gary Moloney during 1997 illustrate the type of dangers faced daily by our troops serving with the UN. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their willingness to put themselves in danger in the interests of bringing peace to the trouble spots of the world.</P>
    <P>Our troops in the Lebanon have found themselves in a particularly difficult situation, caught between the two conflicting sides. Most of the casualties and difficulties for Irish troops in the Lebanon have come about as a result of the activities of the Israeli backed SLA or what are referred to in these reports as the &ldquo;<i>de facto</i> forces&rdquo;. It is unacceptable that a government with whom we maintain friendly relations should arm, train and finance those who are harassing and attacking our troops. Representations have been made by the Government to the Israeli authorities on this matter and it is essential that this pressure is maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister said on 19 October that between January and December 1998, 102 firings were recorded at or close to the Irish UNIFIL positions. He said the bulk of these were by the <i>de facto</i> forces. Everyone recognises the difficult security situation faced by the Israelis and the horrific terrorist attacks to which they have been subjected over the years, but this cannot and does not justify a policy of tolerating and encouraging attacks on our troops.</P>
    <P>One can only hope that the improving situation in the Middle East will continue and that it will not be too long before Irish troops and the entire UNIFIL force can be withdrawn. The progress being made in the implementation of the agreement between Israel and the Palestinians provides grounds for hope. Even more encouraging is the announcement within the past 24 hours that Israel and Syria are to resume negotiations on a peace treaty in Washington next week.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on our Government not just to provide political and moral support for our forces with the United Nations but also to ensure that when Irish troops serve abroad on peacekeeping operations they have the equipment and training necessary to guarantee the maximum possible level of safety and security. I know that training is not a problem as Irish troops have always been well prepared for operations abroad, and this is acknowledged by the respect for them <Col N="1140" /> which is held by other contingents with which they have served.</P>
    <P>However, the situation regarding equipment is much less satisfactory. In this regard the long delays in providing the Army with modern armoured personnel carriers is especially unfortunate. Troops in an area like this cannot rely on trucks and jeeps alone. The shortage of adequate equipment has meant that Irish troops serving abroad have had to some extent to depend on other contingents for protection. This is not operationally desirable and neither is it good for morale.</P>
    <P>If we want our troops to play an active role in peacekeeping operations throughout the world, we will have to provide them with the resources and equipment to enable them to do so. Money is available and I urge the Government to expedite the delivery of the long promised armoured personnel carriers.</P>
    <P>There have also been reports that there has been difficulty in attracting sufficient volunteers to meet our requirements for UNIFIL, and the matter of allowing members of the FCA to serve abroad has been raised on a number of occasions. This has been under consideration for some time, but despite having raised the matter on several occasions with the Minister through parliamentary questions, I have still to determine his views on the matter or to establish when a decision will be made.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises in regard to our participation in peacekeeping operations is that substantial amounts of money are still due to this country from the UN. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told the Dáil last week that Ireland is owed £8.3 million for the cost of providing Irish personnel to UN peacekeeping missions abroad. This debt arises from our participation in Lebanon and Cyprus, because we are responsible for our own expenses in other cases. The financial problems of the United Nations arise from the failure of a number of member states, especially the United States, to discharge their debts to the organisation. Despite its shortcomings, the United Nations has played a valuable role in limiting conflict throughout the world. It is wrong that some countries, which are happy to use the United Nations when its suits their own political agendas, should at the same time restrict the potential of the organisation by refusing to pay their way.</P>
    <P>On occasions such as this, there is usually a queue of people to pay tribute to the Defence Forces. I am sure the members of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps would be more impressed by a serious effort to end the uncertainties and deal with their problems. Unfortunately, this Minister does not inspire confidence among members of the Defence Forces that he has the will to deal with these prob<Col N="1141" /> lems. We will pay a price if these problems are allowed to continue. The Minister must act.</P>
    <P>It is important that a definite decision is made about the numbers in the Defence Forces. This is the one matter undermining the confidence of all units of the Defence Forces at present. A situation cannot continue where the media is drip-fed figures which the Departments of Defence and Finance deny. Despite these denials, the media seem to be constantly drip-fed figures which constitute the final figure for the Defence Forces. These are always well below the predetermined figure of 11,500 which has been accepted by the representative bodies. If we are to continue to spread our good name abroad, the situation cannot persist where we do not have the personnel to go to the unfortunate trouble spots which are the cause of so much concern for the unfortunate people who live there.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance must make a final decision on this matter. We will either act as a unit to ensure the morale of the Defence Forces is restored to what it should be or we will forget about the United Nations obligations of this country. It must be one or the other. Matters cannot be allowed to continue as they are at present. The most important matter is to ensure that the morale of the Defence Forces is restored.</P>

      <P>The development and expansion of our peacekeeping role internationally was one of the strongest arguments advanced in the House for our membership of Partnership for Peace. The equipment of our forces and the experience they would gain in that international Partnership for Peace was canvassed here and publicly by members at senior officer level in the Army. We were told that, to explore and fully develop the role of our peacekeeping troops, we should and would join Partnership for Peace, so the House resolved that we do so.</P>
      <P>As we debate our international peacekeeping function in the calm freedom and peace of the House, one of our partners for peace is pummelling the unfortunate victims and innocent civilians of Grozny and Chechnya with the weaponry of death. Our partners for peace are ineffective and helpless to do anything about it, despite the fact that we have a commitment to real partnership for peace. On every occasion when this issue arose, I expressed my rejection and abhorrence of the worldwide export and delivery of armaments by the major powers, and I expressed that reservation not once but five or six times until the end of the Partnership for Peace debate. Unfortunately, it is not just a question of the delivery or export of armaments. One of our partners for peace, Russia, is delivering armaments in a more vicious and deadly fashion than anyone in the House was prepared to acknowledge could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> It is time our voice was raised if we are to continue to be respected as an independent country which is concerned for peace and which, while engaging in Partnership for Peace, will do everything it can on every possible occasion to reject and repudiate the notion that, within that family of Partnership for Peace, our partners are free not only to export arms but to deliberately export death to innocent civilians and threaten them if they do not leave their homes. We are talking about children, old people and the disabled who have neither the ability nor the capacity to leave to avoid the consequences.</P>
    <P>I had strong reservations about Partnership for Peace. I recall it being asked of us in the House why we should have reservations when even Russia was a member of Partnership for Peace. This was another good argument for our joining the family of nations. We now find that Russia is literally pummelling innocent people with the weaponry of death and that there is nothing we can do about it. We can talk about our various organisations and commitments to UNIFIL, and say we are making great contributions, something I acknowledge, but we are totally and utterly powerless. Whatever Minister represents us in that organisation should at the first possible opportunity insist that the membership of Russia, or any other country which behaves in such a totally offensive fashion, be suspended. They should be dismissed from an organisation we are pleased to join as partners in peace &ndash; some partnership, some peace. The innocent women and children of Grozny must be impressed with the fact that our partners for peace are literally delivering the weaponry of death as we speak.</P>
    <P>Paddy Ashdown, a prominent member of the British Parliament, quoted Thomas Aquinas last night in justifying the fact that the international community was not imposing sanctions on Russia. He said that the test of a just war should be that test of Thomas Aquinas, the third and final part of which is that there is some prospect of success. He said there would be no prospect of success in this case. Are we now importing a new principle into our principles of international morality, namely, that we are prepared to go along with people who say that those who are big enough, strong enough and powerful enough can deliver in whatever fashion they like the weaponry of death and obliterate innocent civilians because we can do nothing about it?</P>

      <P>It is absolutely outrageous as we come to the end of the century and the millennium that people are suggesting on the one hand that the civilian population must vacate their homes so as to make space for a military strike, while on the other hand claiming that the strike can be done without civilian casualties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with deep regret that I inform the Minister of the bad news of the closure of the Molnlycke Factory in Dunmanway, <Col N="1144" /> County Cork, with the loss of 113 jobs. This information was released on 3 February by the company directors, creating an air of dismay in Dunmanway which has been so badly in need of industrial development through the years. When the factory came to Dunmanway 25 years ago, in 1975, it was a major boom to the town as it was the key factory at that time. To this day 113 people are employed there. Its loss will be severely felt by everybody concerned, including the business people of Dunmanway and the employees of the factory.</P>
      <P>I understand the closure has been brought about by competition from companies in the Far East. These companies operate with lower production and labour costs in Mexico and the Far East, bringing about a situation in which European manufacturers find it impossible to compete. I also have the impression that the company has decided to relocate the manufacturing of its specialty single use drapes and sets to Thailand. The decision is based solely on the fact that Thailand provides cheap labour. The fact that the employees in Dunmanway, some with 23 years service, have become highly skilled seems irrelevant.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to inform the Government of the serious situation which could result from the WTO talks recently opened in Seattle. If the regulations are entertained in the Far Eastern countries, with wages being increased, we would be on par with such countries where currently employees, who are probably surviving on a bowl of rice per day, are being paid a pittance. The time is right for the Minister to ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment to take immediate action on this matter.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to set up a task force with a view to getting a replacement industry for Dunmanway. When factories closed in places such as Limerick, Galway and Clonmel, immediate action was taken by the Tánaiste to establish a task force to find a replacement industry. That is what the people of Dunmanway and west Cork need. There is a need for action, not soft talk. Action speaks louder than words. The Tánaiste who is also responsible for trade and commerce should visit Dunmanway immediately and instruct the IDA to secure a replacement industry. Dunmanway, the surrounding hinterland and villages, including Rosscarbery, Drinagh, Drimoleague, Ballineen and Enniskean, has been devastated. The workforce will feel the sting of unemployment when they go on the dole early in the new millennium. They do not have much to look forward to.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste should therefore act immediately. I am sorry she is not present to hear what I have to say. I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter which I will keep under active review in the hope the Tánaiste will be able to remedy the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Tánaiste. I share fully his disappointment at the announcement that Molnlycke in Dunmanway is to close. Molnlycke Health Care of Sweden is one of Europe's leading manufacturers of single use surgical and wound management products. It was formed in February 1998 through a merger of the Swedish SCA Molnlycke Clinical Products and the corresponding Finnish Tamro division, Kolmiset. Employees at the Molnlycke plant in Dunmanway have been kept regularly informed since February 1998 of company progress and its intention to streamline its manufacturing structure. An undertaking had been given to staff that the final decision relating to future manufacturing operations would be made around this time in 1999.</P>
      <P>The IDA has been in close consultation with the company, including visiting the parent company in Sweden. Unfortunately the company announced the closure of its Irish factory in Dunmanway to take effect on Friday, 11 February 2000 with the loss of 113 jobs. Discussions have commenced in Molnlycke with employee representatives on details relating to the closure. Molnlycke has stated that the closure of the Dunmanway facility results from its decision to relocate the manufacturing of the company's specialty single use surgical drapes and sets to Thailand. It has also decided to close its Swedish-based manufacturing units, which is a reflection of the fierce pressures with which it has to cope.</P>
      <P>Following the closure announcement at Molnlycke, IDA Ireland sought an urgent meeting with the company and this took place on 6 December. At that meeting the IDA requested the provision of a profile of the workforce, including skills analysis, age etc. This profile will be presented to FÁS to assist in identifying opportunities for staff. FÁS will also contact the company with a view to assessing the training and retraining needs of staff. The parent company has undertaken to provide expert advice and assistance for all employees and to co-operate closely with the IDA in seeking a replacement industry for the Dunmanway area. In that regard the company has also undertaken to prepare a profile of the Dunmanway facility which will be circulated to all IDA offices overseas and within the IDA's operating divisions for marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following five years of record breaking results at national level IDA Ireland is now placing a greater emphasis on the regional dispersal of investment projects. In this way it hopes to achieve a better balance in job creation across the country by overseas companies. Key IDA executives are being charged with responsibility for delivering to specific regions, in addition to their traditional responsibility of project and business <Col N="1146" /> development. This new structure recognises the critical need to deliver more to the regions and integrate and co-ordinate the focus of the organisation on its regional development mandate. I hope the concerted campaign being mounted by the agencies will yield positive results for Dunmanway.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this serious topic. The death of a child is distressing for parents at any time. To discover five years after that sad event has taken place that the lungs and heart of the child are on a shelf in the hospital is shocking and cruel. I raise this matter in an effort to help the parents involved, Bernard and Fionnuala Reilly, to get answers. I realise the Minister of State will have a prepared script but if it does not cover the following questions I would appreciate a further reply from him later. The answering of questions from the parents could help soften the blow.</P>
      <P>The parents about whom I am speaking and all the other parents who have been caught in this situation and have now formed the Justice for Parents Group would like to know how the organs of a child could be kept for five years in any hospital. Why did this happen and can the Minister of State guarantee that it will never happen again? When asked how long organs can be kept a hospital spokesperson used the phrase &ldquo;for a reasonable period of time&rdquo;. What exactly does this mean? Is there an onus on the hospital to return the organs to the parents at the end of this period? The mention of incineration is not something that placates parents who are already deeply upset.</P>
      <P>The hardship unnecessarily imposed on parents who have discovered these sad facts cannot be overexaggerated. No hospital should repeat this ordeal unless parents willingly and formally agree to organs being kept, perhaps to help another child lead a fuller life. The donation of organs is a vital part of medical science and the donor or their relatives must always agree. What makes this matter upsetting for parents and any right thinking person is that it has been handled in such a careless manner.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State establish an inquiry into these events to enable the Parents for Justice Group to ask questions, receive explanations and, above all, guarantee that a new standard will prevail to ensure they do not recur? There is a lack of information and an absence of acceptable explanations. Parents should not have to suffer further by having to fight bureaucracy to secure the information they require. All possible facilities should be put at their disposal.</P>

      <P>The question asked of the Minister of State regarding the policy of hospitals in holding human organs in storage without the consent or knowledge of the families involved does not convey the outrage, distress and trauma suffered by the many families involved in this crisis. We still do not know how many are involved. The death of a family member is a cause of sadness. To have this revisited on the family concerned because of the policy of hospitals is not good enough. The families involved should have complete access to files and information and their fears and concerns allayed forthwith. There should be a public inquiry to enable the Parents for Justice Group access the available files on the many families involved in this distressing situation.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to reveal the general policy of the hospitals to hold human organs in storage for periods of up to five years without the consent or knowledge of the families involved. Will the Minister also outline the current policy in relation to this issue and the policy and procedures that prevailed prior to 1997? How many such organs are still being held in storage without the knowledge of the families concerned? What is the intention of the hospitals or the Department in terms of revealing all this information, informing the families and/or the disposal of the organs? What steps does the Minister intend to take to progress the queries currently before the Department and the hospital concerned? How many hospitals are involved? We must be able to determine the extent of the problem and I ask the Minister to proceed in a proactive way so that we can alleviate any further distress, sadness or trauma being experienced by the families. We should have a full and frank report through a public inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Browne and McGuinness for bringing these issues to our attention. The Minister regrets that he cannot be here this evening to reply to these Adjournment matters owing to a prior engagement.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the position in relation to the retention of tissue or organs following post-mortem examination. Before doing so I would like to express my sympathy to the families concerned for the stress and additional grief they have suffered as a result of the disclosure of practices in this sensitive area.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, post-mortem examinations are carried out to establish the cause of death and to examine the effects of treatment. This usually involves the retention of tissue. In certain cases the post-mortem examination is incomplete without the retention and subsequent evaluation of an entire organ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> I am informed that it has traditionally been accepted practice in pathology that consent to a post-mortem examination is required. However, it has not been standard practice to provide relatives with specific details of the retention of tissue and organs for further diagnostic or other purposes.</P>
    <P>Current practice in autopsy pathology was developed many years ago at a time when the principles of informed consent were less developed. The area is particularly difficult as it involves the presentation of an important area of medical practice and scientific inquiry to people who are unfamiliar with the autopsy, and who may find the procedure upsetting at a time of emotional stress.</P>
    <P>The professional body responsible for standards and practices in pathology in Ireland, the Faculty of Pathology, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, has been reviewing current consent arrangements for post-mortem examination and, in particular, the retention of tissue or organs for further diagnosis, teaching and research. The faculty has recommended to its fellows that specific consent for retention of tissue for such purposes be sought for all post-mortem examinations. The faculty considers that it is essential to be explicit in relation to this issue and accordingly is currently finalising a set of guidelines which will be issued to all members of the faculty as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The concerns regarding the retention of tissue or organs at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin arose initially in June 1999 from a specific case at the hospital where it emerged that tissue had been retained following a post-mortem procedure performed at the hospital in 1985.</P>
    <P>My Department's chief medical officer reviewed the practice in Crumlin at that time and was satisfied that the practice which had applied in Crumlin was consistent with the standard practice of pathologists in general. On the basis of this review, the CMO was satisfied that the hospital had taken appropriate steps to introduce a more comprehensive consent form which dealt specifically with the retention of tissue and organs.</P>
    <P>I understand the total number of children whose organs have been retained at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is 98. The hospital is pursuing a sensitive method of dealing with retained tissue or organs, first through the faculty of pathology and more recently with a crematorium. Once that mechanism is in place, it is the hospital's intention to contact all of the families concerned. In recent months the hospital authorities have responded to families who have contacted them and have arrangements in place to facilitate any individual family who wishes to make alternative arrangements.</P>
    <P>The chief medical officer of my Department has today written to the chief executive officer of each health agency asking them to ensure, pend<Col N="1149" /> ing the issue by the faculty of pathology of its guidelines on this matter, that a policy of informed consent by next of kin to the carrying out of a post-mortem and retention of tissue or organs operates in each health agency. Each agency has also been asked to make appropriate arrangements to deal with any organs or tissue which have been retained and in a manner which is sensitive to the needs of individual families.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of post-mortem examination practices is a matter for the health agencies concerned. I am confident that the guidelines of the faculty of pathology, which will ensure that tissue and organs will only be used for diagnostic, treatment and research purposes where explicit consent has been obtained from next of kin, will form the basis for best practice in this area.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied these arrangements will ensure that post-mortem examinations are conducted in a manner that is sensitive to the needs of families and will ensure that the necessary functions and processes involved in post-mortem examination can be understood and accepted by the general public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has received a formal request to meet with concerned parents on this matter and I know he will respond positively to this request.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue. It is an issue that seeks to remove an invidious distinction and I am anxious to ensure that VTOS students are treated the same. We have a position where half the students on the VTOS schemes who are one year unemployed qualify for the £25 training bonus. The other half, who are six months unemployed, do not qualify for the training bonus. All students have met the same criterion since entry to the VTOS scheme is contingent on six months unemployment. Having met the same entry requirement, experiencing the same courses and sharing the same commitment to acquire training to enable them to acquire a range of skills including interior design, media skills, video, information technology, design technology, general studies, languages, computers, etc. which will enable them become valuable members of the workforce in the future, one group of people qualify for the training bonus of £25 to which participants in VTOS schemes became entitled to on 1 September last.</P>
      <P>The bonus of £25 is welcome. It is good thinking to give a positive incentive to people to participate in VTOS schemes, yet it is significantly damaging to suggest to people who are experiencing the same courses with the same teachers in the same circumstance that they should have been unemployed for 12 rather than six months to get this training bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> Another point which appears to be patently absurd is the fact that if the students who are disqualified from the £25 training bonus, instead of coming on to the VTOS scheme, had stayed unemployed for six additional months, they would qualify for the additional £25 training bonus. Where is the incentive in that to return to work?</P>
    <P>One might argue that this is a bureaucratic fallout from another aim, namely that FÁS and VTOS participants be treated equally. VTOS is specifically structured with definite subjects aimed at a particular outcome. This is an invidious distinction. This week someone who has had his or her taxability level raised from £100 to £110 stands to make a net benefit of £3.50. I hope that when the talks conclude between the partners that will significantly change. That must happen if we are to create an incentive for people to return to the workforce.</P>
    <P>VTOS participants are people who have made a very serious commitment. I have received a number of signatures, not merely from the participants affected by this distinction but also from those who are in receipt of the benefit and from their teachers across a wide range of skills and disciplines. The cost of treating all participants equally is not significant. Those who qualify for the bonus were informed on 11 November that the bonus would be backdated to 1 September. Unfortunately, this issue will tend to divide students who are already quite vulnerable. I greatly admire the commitment of the students and their teachers.</P>
    <P>The scheme is an attempt to give people a lift and I appeal to the Minister of State to consider the removal of the existing anomaly. It is not sufficient to state that because this inequality applies in regard to FÁS, it should have a knock-on effect on VTOS. Even if the Government is waiting to deal with FÁS schemes under the Social Welfare Bill, would it not be possible to treat VTOS students equally in terms of the £25 training bonus? I am sure that would be welcomed on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme was established in 1989 as a special initiative designed to cater for the education and training needs of the long-term unemployed. The current running cost of the programme is approximately £29 million. For some time, the Government had been concerned at the failure of education and training schemes for unemployed people to attract people who had been unemployed for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A European Social Fund evaluation report, ESF and the Long-Term Unemployed, was published in November 1998. The major conclusion of this evaluation was that there should be a change in emphasis for long-term unemployed away from work experience programmes such as <Col N="1151" /> community employment towards placement in education and training. The report also recommended the need for a level playing pitch in the payment of allowances so that participants could avail of the option which best met their needs. At the time, the rate of payment for community employment was higher than in FÁS training programmes.</P>
    <P>Early in 1999, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced details of a new £25 per week bonus, which would be paid to participants who were long-term unemployed, that is unemployed for at least one year, prior to commencing a FÁS programme. The extra allowance was seen as an important incentive in encouraging the most marginalised in the labour market to take the important step of returning to training to upgrade their skills. About 11,000 people stand to benefit from this allowance.</P>
    <P>In September of this year, it was decided to apply this incentive to the vocational training opportunities scheme in order to make it more attractive for long-term unemployed people to return to education. The bonus is payable to VTOS students who had been in receipt of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit and one parent family payment for at least one year prior to commencing the programmes. Periods spent on community employment or the job initiative may be combined with periods on the above mentioned social welfare payments for the purpose of meeting the qualifying period for the bonus. The bonus will also apply to any participants who meet these qualifying criteria on Youthreach or senior traveller training programmes. The cost of this measure is expected to amount to £3.6 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>One of the principal objectives of VTOS is to reach those most in need, particularly older unemployed people and those with the lowest educational skills to help them raise their educational and skills levels to enhance their chances <Col N="1152" /> of gaining employment or progressing to further education and training. There had been some criticism that we were not reaching those whom it was most difficult to reach and the recent mid-term evaluation of the ESF human resource operational programme specifically called for a more effective and targeted approach in respect of the long-term unemployed, starting training programmes for the remainder of the operational programme.</P>
    <P>It is the intention to review the terms of VTOS in the context of a consultancy study currently being undertaken with a view to making the scheme even more effective in reaching those whom it is most difficult to reach. The equalisation of this bonus with that payable by FÁS was seen as an essential step in achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, not surprising that the availability of a bonus to some participants on a scheme such as VTOS should create demands that it be extended to all participants. I understand the Department of Education and Science has received a number of queries from students and others on these lines. However, the effect of the incentive in prioritising access for the long-term unemployed would be dissipated if the bonus was applied to all VTOS participants. In addition, it is essential to maintain a common approach in the treatment of such allowances across FÁS and the education area. For that reason, the Department is unable to extend the bonus to VTOS participants who had been short-term unemployed before they joined the scheme. The House will appreciate that we are implementing the conditions of the bonus scheme on the same basis as FÁS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The international pigmeat market has been experiencing serious difficulties over the past year or so due to the combination of oversupply of pigs and substantially reduced demand in the traditional import markets of Russia and the Far East. Ireland's pigmeat sector has not been immune from these developments.</P>
      <P>I have raised the continuing difficulties in the pigmeat market directly with Commissioner Fischler and also in the most recent Agriculture Council where I, along with a number of other member states sought urgent action to address the matter. In particular, I sought immediate reinstatement of the high export refund to Russia and the resumption of the food aid programme under which 100,000 tonnes of EU pigmeat was committed to Russia. My Department is in ongoing contact with the Commission on this and every opportunity is used, including most recently at the pigmeat management meeting, to raise the need for urgent action.</P>
      <P>I accept that particular difficulties are being experienced by certain producers in the Border regions as a result of the fire at a Northern Ireland pig processing plant in 1998. I have met Commissioner Fischler recently on this and have been in contact with him an a number of occasions since then in relation to a special measure aimed at alleviating the problems for the producers in question. Senior officials of my Department also had meetings with the Commission on the matter and contact is continuing with a view to finding a solution within the constraints of EU State aid law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the longer term, I accept the issue of slaughter capacity requires examination, in the light of developments in the wider pigmeat market, and particularly based on the experience following the fire at the northern plant. I have requested Enterprise Ireland to carry out an <Col N="1154" /> examination of the suitability of slaughtering and processing capacity and its adequacy in terms of the location of pig production on the island as a whole. I understand Enterprise Ireland is making arrangements for a consultancy study to be carried out and I have asked for this to be completed at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office's agricultural labour input release indicates that there were 146,200 family farms in the country in 1998. The number of farms below 20 hectares has been declining in recent years while the number of farms above that size has been rising slightly. The overall rate of decline in farm numbers in Ireland has been lower than that in most other EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teagasc's national farm survey provides an estimate of the proportion of farmers in the <Col N="1155" /> sample working in some form of off-farm employment. In 1998 the figure was 30%. On 44% of farms either the farmer of his-her spouse had off farm employment. These figures have been rising in recent years. As the Teagasc sample excludes some very small farms, it is probable that the actual figures for all farms are somewhat higher than this. I expect both of the above trends to continue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in part-time farming, as this is the best route to viability for many of our farm families. A clear impact of this can be seen in the sharp decline in recent years in the proportion of farmers in relative poverty, as measured by the number with household income per person below 50% of the national average. Farmers in fact now have a much lower risk of being in relative poverty, 13%, than the population in general, 22%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is a participant in the National Anti Poverty Strategy known as NAPS which was launched in 1997.</P>
      <P>In addressing rural poverty one of the five themes in NAPS the target is to ensure that strategies are developed with regard to the provision of services in rural areas, especially those concerned with educational disadvantage, unemployment and income adequacy so that the overall target of the NAPS is achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> That overall target was to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor from 9-15% in the population to less than 5-10% as measured by the ESRI. The most recent data available relate to the ESRI's living in Ireland survey. This shows that the numbers experiencing consistent poverty have fallen to 7-10% of the population by 1997, which indicates that the NAPS global target was virtually achieved. In the light of this progress, the Government has set a new target of reducing consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004.</P>
    <P>NAPS identified those in poverty as including both low income farmers and other non-farm rural dwellers. The living in Ireland surveys suggest that the level of farm households in poverty has decreased substantially in recent years. In 1997 13% of farm households were identified in this category compared with 20% in 1994 and 33% in 1987. This trend is the reverse of the general position in households. The comparable figures are 16% in 1987, 18% in 1994 and 22% in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency has commissioned research on low income farm households and the results should be available in the New Year. The results will be useful in refocusing policy measures as appropriate.</P>
    <P>My Department's contribution to NAPS is principally through the operation of its programmes and schemes. These are a mix of income supports, including compensatory payments, measures to improve farm structures and their viability and support for alternative enterprises. The farm assist scheme is, of course, operated through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>Income support for farmers in the form of direct payments has grown dramatically since the MacSharry CAP reforms. In 1998 direct payments, mainly consisting of headage payments in disadvantaged areas and CAP reform compensation payments, accounted for 56% of aggregate farm income.</P>
    <P>The rural development fund promised in the White Paper has been provided for in the national development plan with an allocation of some £6 million. The Fund will finance research, evaluations and pilot actions, where appropriate, to provide information and advice to policy makers on such issues as the effectiveness of sectoral policies, structural change, income and employment opportunities and rural inclusion. I am pleased to say the strategy set out in the White Paper endorses and supports the objectives contained in the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>The national development plan, which gives practical expression to the commitments in the White Paper, provides for investments in agriculture and rural development of £6.7 billion over the next seven years which will directly impact on rural areas. Other investments under the plan in areas such as housing, health, roads, transport and enterprise support will also be of considerable importance in improving the economic and social life of rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime. I have decided to take the opportunity to make significant changes in the system which operates in Ireland in order to ensure that active, committed producers have greater access to quota over the coming years. It is essential that the new system will bring a greater degree of certainty to these producers so that the dairy industry will be in a position to meet the competitive challenges that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>To achieve this I have decided that the transfer of quota based on the rigid link between quota and land will be replaced by a system that allows for the sale of quota in a structured manner and in line with priority categories which will be set. This will be done in a fair and balanced way to encourage the best possible development of the industry while recognising the interests of all the parties involved. I hope that this will facilitate a more orderly arrangement for the distribution of quota.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the introduction of changes to the manner in which quotas can be transferred is a complex process and the new legislation will therefore have to address the question of family transfers and other exceptional circumstances as well as seeking to provide adequate protection for all milk producers. It is also intended to include arrangements for dealing with existing and expiring leases.</P>
      <P>The new regulation does not come into force until 1 April 2000 and therefore, the changes which I intend to make cannot come into effect until that date. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement on details of the proposed changes to the milk quota regime in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have already announced the eligibility criteria for the allocation of the additional 20.5 million gallons milk quota which becomes available to producers on 1 April 2000.</P>

      <P>The national development plan contains particular provisions relevant to the food industry. These provide a total indicative public funding allocation of £282 million and reflect the recommendations of the food industry development group. In line with a general aim to maximise competitiveness and market-orientation, the provisions will assist innovation and added value.</P>
      <P>The food-related provisions cover capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion, and human resources. While all have a relevant role, there will be a particular emphasis on added value and innovation under the capital investment and research and development initiatives. In the case of capital investment, the national development plan points out that a specific focus of support will be the high value prepared consumer foods and food ingredient sectors. This will assist Irish companies to avail of the substantial growth opportunities that exist in these sectors.</P>
      <P>The support measures on research and development will cover three complementary facets institutional &ndash; or public &ndash; research, in-company research and technology transfer. These will assist innovation and enhance the adaptability of the food industry.

One of these is agriculture under which the issues currently agreed for discussion are CAP issues, animal and plant health, policy and research and rural development.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that yesterday I met the new Northern Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Brid Rodgers, for an initial discussion on matters of mutual concern. We agreed to intensify existing co-operation and to establish a more formal framework. It was also agreed that some specific areas merited immediate attention.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Good Friday Agreement also provided for the establishment of six North-South Implementation bodies. Three of these are of particular interest in relation to my areas of responsibility:</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Promotion Board has responsibility on an island-wide basis for a range of functions in regard to food safety, including promotion and research, the communication of food alerts and the surveillance of food borne diseases. Existing food safety agencies, North and South, will continue to be responsible for inspection and enforcement.</P>
      <P>The trade and business development body exercises a range of functions including the promotion of North-South trade and devising new approaches to business development in a cross-border context.</P>
      <P>The special EU programmes body exercises managerial functions in relation to new community initiatives under the new round of Structural Funds including Interreg III and LEADER + in which my Department has a special interest.</P>

      <P>The data on farm household income requested by the Deputy are not available. The CSO and Teagasc publish detailed information each year on income from farming, but no such annual information is published on the income received by farm households from off farm sources. I have asked both bodies to address this important gap in the information available to us.</P>
      <P>The last complete information on farm household income was that published in the household budget survey for 1994-95. This showed that the average gross household income of farm households was £18,582, compared to £15,055 for other rural households and £18,951 for urban households. The survey also showed that 47% of farm household income came from off-farm sources.</P>
      <P>Teagasc's national farm survey provides an estimate of the proportion of farmers, or their spouses, in the sample working off-farm. The results for the last five years show a rising proportion of farmers or spouses with off-farm employment. The figures are as follows:</P>

    <P>The rise in off-farm employment since the household budget survey in 1994-95, strongly suggests that more than half of farm household income now comes from off-farm sources.</P>
    <P>Many farm families are now securing their place in rural Ireland by a combination of on-farm and off-farm work, and are supported by a range of state and EU agriculture payments. I welcome this trend. The impact can be seen in the sharp decline in recent years in the proportion of farmers in relative poverty, as measured by the number with household income per person below 50% of the national average. In 1997, 13% of farm households were in this category, compared to 20% in 1994, and 33% in 1987. As I pointed out, in relation to an earlier question, farmers now have a much lower risk of being in relative poverty &ndash; 13% &ndash; than the population in general &ndash; 22%.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development </P>
    <P>(Mr. Walsh): The rural environment protection scheme which was introduced in 1994 plays a vital role in the promotion of sustainable agriculture through fostering environmentally friendly farming practices, while at the same time enhancing farm viability.</P>
    <P>REPS now plays a pivotal role in the promotion of sustainable agriculture by supporting the production of quality food in an extensive and environmentally friendly manner, while at the same time protecting wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna. In return for farming in accordance with the scheme guidelines participants are paid compensation over a five year period. To date in excess of £430 million has been paid to farmers participating in the scheme and this significant contribution to farm incomes is a major factor in maintaining the viability of farm units. At present, there are 44,000 farmers participating which indicates a very high of interest in the measure.</P>
    <P>While the scheme has enhanced family farm income the evaluation report furnished to the EU Commission in July established that while family farm incomes inclusive of the REPS payments are 13% higher than an extensive non-REP scheme farm they remain 4% lower than the national average family farm income. The evaluation has also showed that family farm income per hectare on REP Scheme farms when the REPS payments are included increased significantly since 1994.</P>
    <P>For the period 2000-06, I have secured total funding of 1.5 billion for REPS. This compares with expenditure of £430 million under the current REP scheme since its introduction in 1994. Proposals for a new REP scheme will be included in the rural development plan which my Department will be submitting to the European Commission before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I will be pressing for the earliest introduction of the new REPS and am planning the widest publicity and promotion of the measure when I secure EU agreement. This will include briefing of local Department staff as well as Teagasc and the approved planners. I will also be considering holding regional seminars to appraise farmers of the new REPS.</P>

      <P>A new scheme of early retirement from farming is being prepared in my Department for submission to the European Commission as part of a rural development plan for the period 2000-06. The new scheme is being drawn up in accordance with the terms of EU Council Regulation 1257-99 on support for rural development.</P>
      <P>The draft plan must be submitted to the Commission by 4 January 2000 and the Commission will then have six months to approve it, though I will be pressing for approval at the earliest possible date. Until the plan has been approved by the Commission, it is not possible to state categorically what the terms of the new early retirement scheme will be. However, my Department's proposals will take account of the fact that the Council Regulation, unlike the regulation on which the present scheme is based, does not include the requirement that both the transferor and the transferee be engaged in farming as a main occupation and that the transferee enlarge the holding. I am aware that these requirements had discouraged some farmers from taking part in the existing scheme and I am glad that my efforts to have them changed were successful.</P>

      <P>I set up the sheepmeat forum last year to evaluate the future of the <Col N="1163" /> sheepmeat sector and to assess how the industry can best address the constraints and future challenges facing it. The forum identified a wide range of issues across all areas of the sector and agreed a comprehensive series of recommendations which, if implemented, would enable the industry to prepare for the challenges ahead. I am anxious to ensure that these recommendations are implemented and, for that reason, I have decided to set up a monitoring committee under the chairmanship of Dr Frank Crosby, UCD, to progress implementations of those recommendations which are amenable to action at national level. These recommendations relate to improvements in efficiency and quality of production and in the promotion and marketing of lamb on the home and export market. The committee is representative of all interests in the industry and will work closely with my Department.</P>
      <P>The other recommendations relate in the main to the deficiencies in the sheepmeat regime and, in particular, to the failure of the ewe premium system to properly compensate Irish producers for the low prices here. I raised the issues at the meeting of the Agriculture Council last month.</P>
      <P>At that meeting, I outlined the serious income situation facing sheep producers at the present time and the failure of the ewe premium system to properly compensate Irish producers because of the lack of convergence of prices across the European Union. In particular, I asked for urgent action to address these issues, including by way of the temporary suspension of the stabiliser or through the payment of a supplementary premium in member states where prices are significantly below the EU average. Apart from the United Kingdom, I received no support from other member states. Commissioner Fischler has indicated that he intends to review the current regime next year. I intend to continue to press the Commission on these issues.</P>

      <P>In January of this year the Government adopted an action plan for implementing the Information Society in Ireland. This plan sets out commitments over a whole range of actions including: investment in telecommunications infrastructure; the development of electronic commerce or e-commerce; putting in place the necessary legislative and regulatory measures to enable e-commerce to operate.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned the shift from a policy of price support to direct income support in the 1992 CAP reform agreement was accompanied by more detailed application forms and more onerous administrative requirements for farmers. The reform package with new and revised schemes, integrated administration and control provisions and the setting of very rigorous standards of accountability to the EU was also a major challenge for my Department.</P>
      <P>I believe that sufficient progress has been made in recent years in delivering services using information technology. Indeed it is obvious that without extensive use of IT it would not be possible to deliver services in an efficient manner.  Since the middle of this year my Department has been conducting a major review of its IT strategy. This has been done in association with external consultants and I expect to receive the final report very soon.</P>
      <P>The IT strategy and plan will spell out what needs to be done to upgrade our IT systems in order to meet the various challenges ahead including those flowing from Agenda 2000. More effective integration of IT systems will provide the basis for better linkage between my Department and its clients. The question of submission of application forms electronically and indeed moving to a system of electronic funds transfer for various payments will be examined as part of this re-development. Any move to accepting premia and headage application forms by e-mail would of course have to be approved by the EU Commission. That body recently indicated that it is examining the question of electronic signatures and will issue appropriate guidelines to member states when that examination is completed.</P>

      <P>I recognise the fundamental role of young farmers in securing the future of the agriculture sector and maintaining a viable rural population. Consequently, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 launched last month provides for a range of measures which will assist young farmers embarking on their farming career. These include the continuation of the scheme of installation aid to encourage the taking over of farms by younger farmers and assisting young farmers as they first set up in farming.</P>
      <P>Provision for a development programme for young farmers is also made in the national development plan. While the detailed terms and conditions of this new Programme are still under consideration, I am confident that it will facilitate the consolidation of a strong core of confident young farmers.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement, a special provision of 5 million gallons of milk quota is being set aside for young farmers and it is envisaged that this will be allocated in April 2000.</P>
      <P>The early retirement scheme, which has been extremely successful since its introduction in 1994, will continue in the coming years and some £565 million has been provided for the measure in the period 2000-06. More than 9,000 farmers have participated in the measure since its inception and the Scheme has had an important role in facilitating young farmers to take over farms.</P>
      <P>The proposed measures and improvements are in addition to current measures and these are being continued beyond the year 2000. Tax incentives are already in place aimed at reducing the cost of ownership transfer for young farmers. Priority will continue to be given to young farmers in the allocation of suckler and ewe premium quota rights from the national reserve.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced the formation of a task force to review agricultural education and training. Its terms of reference are to review agricultural education and training in the context of the changing economic and social environment and to make recommendations to address those needs. I expect the task force will have completed its work early in the new year and its findings should further benefit young farmers.</P>
      <P>Significantly, the Agri-Food Strategy Committee 2010, which I have established to critically plan for the development of the agricultural industry, will examine all aspects, including the issue of land mobility which will directly affect young farmers in the year 2000 and beyond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic viability of farming activities and the adequate provision for farm families, in terms of total income, are increasingly two separate questions, because of the rising level of income to farm families from off-farm sources.</P>
      <P>More than 44,000 farmers are estimated by Teagasc researchers to be commercially viable, meaning that the family farm income is sufficient to remunerate the family labour on the farm, plus a 5% return for non-fixed assets. However, a much larger number of farm families than this are achieving a reasonable income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increasing number of farm families are supplementing their farm income with off-farm earnings and find this the best way to provide adequately for themselves and their families. Teagasc's national farm survey gives an estimate of the numbers of farmers in some form of off-farm employment. In 1998 almost 30% of farm holders <Col N="1167" /> had off farm employment as an additional source of income. Either the farmer or the spouse is engaged in off-farm work on 44% of farms.</P>
    <P>The latest available household budget survey, for 1994-95, showed that only half of farm household income derived from farming activities, with the balance coming from off-farm employment and State transfers. As the economy continues to grow, and to provide new job opportunities in rural areas, off-farm employment is likely to make an increasing contribution to total household income for many farm families.</P>
    <P>The success of these trends can be seen in the ESRI's recent report on poverty trends, which showed that farm households now have a lower risk of being in poverty than other households. The percentage of farm households in poverty declined from 33% in 1987 to 13% in 1997. This means that in 1997, only 13% of farm households had an income of less than half the national average, compared to 22% of all households.</P>

      <P>The position is that <Col N="1168" /> the EU regulations governing the integrated administration and control system require that on-the-spot checks should be unannounced. However, the regulations also provide that advance warning limited to the strict minimum necessary may be given and that as a general rule this should not exceed 48 hours.</P>
      <P>During the recent negotiations on changes to the integrated administration and control system in the context of Agenda 2000 Ireland sought to have the maximum notice time changed from 48 hours to 96 hours particularly in the light of the introduction of the computerised movement monitoring system for bovine animals. The European Commission, however, was not prepared to accede to this request. In the light of the Commission's response my Department has no option but to operate the notification requirements as specified in the regulations.</P>

      <P>Commonage framework plans are, in effect, a comprehensive environmental assessment of commonage land. These plans are being drawn up by teams of agriculturalists and environmentalists specially trained by my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The preparation of such plans involves a detailed assessment of the environmental status of each commonage. The main aim of the framework plans is to determine the sustainable level of farming activity which will allow for the regeneration of damaged vegetation.</P>
      <P>The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have entered contracts for the drawing up of framework plans for 65 commonage work blocks comprising an area of 245,700 hectares, 65,700 hectares of which have been completed and a further 35,500 hectares of which it is expected will be completed in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The process used in drawing up the plans is more complex than originally anticipated and in recognition of this fact additional teams were trained to help with the process. In view of the fact that the information in these plans will establish baseline data for future evaluation it is essential that the procedures for drawing up the plans be fully complied with.</P>

    <P>National legislation has been enacted to deal with the problem of illegal dumping. The persons or bodies empowered under such legislation are primarily responsible in this area but in so far as the rural environment protection scheme is concerned participants are prohibited from engaging in such actions. The question of annexation of land is a matter of title which again is governed by national legislation. It is a condition of eligibility under the REP scheme that participants must have legal title to the land declared.</P>

      <P>Imports of poultry meat have become a significant feature of the <Col N="1170" /> industry and I understand price attractiveness is an important consideration. My preference is that the industry should use native raw material to the greatest degree possible but it is the case that a considerable quantity of these imports are processed into finished consumer products, and re-exported.</P>
      <P>Poultry products may be imported from other member states of the European Union and from third countries in accordance with EU harmonised rules. The product may be exported direct to Ireland or through another member state.</P>
      <P>The main conditions for imports into Ireland provided for by the harmonised rules are: advance notification to my Department of each consignment; the goods must be accompanied by veterinary certification or, in certain cases, a commercial document; the goods must come from an approved establishment, that is, slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold-store which has been approved by the EU Commission and the goods may be subject to inspection by officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>Imports of poultry meat products are selected for sampling on a regular basis to monitor the health status of the product. Under arrangements agreed between the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and my Department, 1,200 samples of imported poultry meat will be tested to check for the presence of illegal residues. It must be borne in mind, however, that particular imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring as Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation to allow the free circulation of legally imported goods within the EU. Goods detected as not being in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and if necessary destroyed.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of evaluating the contribution of badgers to the spread of TB, I have arranged for the effect of badger removal on TB levels in cattle to be studied in detail. The East Offaly badger removal project has been in place for some time and further research commenced in four area experimental project in parts of Cork north, Donegal, Kilkenny and Monaghan in 1997. These arrangements are operated under licences granted by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> Apart from the area projects, licences are also granted at individual farm level to research specific outbreaks of disease, under agreed protocols with the NPWS. Veterinary and technical staff attached to DVOs, as part of their general duties, are involved in the operation of licences. Due to the volume of other priority work in a number of district veterinary offices, I am aware that due to a shortage of staff numbers, it is not always possible to ensure that all badger removal licences are serviced promptly.</P>
    <P>My Department keeps the deployment of staff at all offices under its control under ongoing review with the aim of ensuring the best possible service to its farming clients. My Department is currently reviewing the measures in place in relation to the disease eradication schemes with a view to presenting proposals to the animal health forum on the regime to be applied from 2000 onwards.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to exports to Libya is that an agreement was signed with a Libyan Government delegation in July 1998 providing for the re-opening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts. This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997. The Libyan Government, through the General People's Committee, formally cleared the agreement before the end of September of that year and written confirmation to this effect was received.</P>
      <P>Despite the agreement, there has been a delay on the part of the Libyan authorities in putting it into effect in relation to live cattle exports. This delay has been a matter of serious concern both to myself and the Government. Ongoing contact has been maintained with the Libyan authorities, through every appropriate channel, with a view to ensuring that the agreement is implemented in practice. I visited Libya in August and there has been correspondence from the Taoiseach to the Libyan leader since then. As recently as last month, I wrote again to the Libyan Minister for Animal Health in this matter. We are still awaiting a reply from the Libyans to these communications. I will, however, continue to pursue every avenue open to me to ensure that this agreement is honoured.</P>
      <P>Exports of live cattle and calves to date this year have substantially increased to 386,000 compared with 150,000 and 52,000 in the corresponding periods of 1998 and 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 47, 48 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The international pigmeat market has been experiencing serious difficulties over the past year or so due to the combination of oversupply of pigs and substantially reduced demand in the traditional import markets of Russia and the Far East. Ireland's pigmeat sector has not been immune from these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the serious effects of this situation on the incomes of Irish producers, I negotiated increased support arrangements at EU level including substantial export refund increases, a generous subsidy for private storage of pigmeat and a major food aid package to Russia, which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. As a result pigmeat prices have increased by nearly 18% since the beginning of 1999. Despite this positive result, the situation is still not satisfactory and there is much more ground to be covered in relation to improving the income levels of producers. In this regard, I have raised the weak market situation at the most recent EU Agriculture Council meeting and, along with a number of other member states requested further market <Col N="1174" /> support to be put in place. I am continuing to press the matter at EU level, and I have written to EU Commissioner Fischler regarding the current difficulties in the pigmeat market.</P>
    <P>At national level, I had meetings recently with the feed suppliers and the banks to ensure they do all in their power to support producers at this time. I met also with the pigmeat processors to ensure that everything possible was being done in terms of slaughtering schedules and marketing initiatives to lessen the adverse effects of the market weakness on the primary production sector. In terms of processing capacity, I have asked Enterprise Ireland to examine the situation as a matter of urgency and to consider the current structure of the industry.</P>
    <P>I met the Irish Pigmeat Processors Association in mid-November to discuss the current weakness in the pigmeat market. At that meeting I emphasised in particular the continuing need for adequate slaughtering facilities during the remainder of the year and into the new year. It was also agreed at the meeting that the processors would do all in their power to ensure producers were facilitated in having their pigs slaughtered as they became available. It was agreed also that the processors would submit slaughter schedules for the period in question to my Department. Most of these have now been received and I understand the remainder are in preparation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied following further contact with the processors and the producers organisation that adequate facilities are being made available and that producers are not being asked to hold back finished pigs.</P>
    <P>As regards the situation in the Border counties, it is the case that certain producers in these areas are experiencing financial difficulties and it is clear that further action is required to alleviate their difficulties. I recognise this and have been in contact with the Commission. I have put certain ideas to Commissioner Fischler and these ideas have been the subject of contact at senior level between my Department and the Commission. While there are serious constraints arising from the EU State aids provisions, contact with the Commission is nevertheless ongoing to find acceptable solutions to the problems in this area.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to give the number of farmers awaiting payment under any scheme until the eligibility of each application is established. All queries in relation to each problem case must be resolved before a decision can be made on whether payment is due.</P>

      <P>Of the remainder 32 cases have so far been found to be ineligible for payment for various reasons including no area aid application submitted, false declaration penalties and non-compliance with regulations governing the scheme. The balance involve queries in relation to their area aid applications or their sheep headage applications.  Payment cannot issue in these cases until the relevant queries are resolved and their eligibility is established.</P>
      <P>In regard to the 1999 cattle headage-beef cow scheme, the number of applications received from farmers in the constituency of Cork south-west was 2,685 of which 2,350 have been paid. Of the remainder, 16 have so far been found to be ineligible because they either failed to lodge area aid applications or had less than the minimum area required to qualify for payment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by sheep producers at present. However, there has been a firmer trade in recent weeks during which prices have increase significantly, with the result that prices are now approximately 20% higher than the same time last year. This firmer market should be sustained by strengthening demand in the run-up to Christmas. Beyond that there are reasonable grounds for believing that market conditions in 2000 should be somewhat better than in 1999. While the sheepmeat market balance in the EU is expected to remain unchanged in 2000, the lower sheep numbers in this country and the elimination of intervention beef stocks should result in an increase in prices for red meat generally, including sheepmeat. A recovery in the Russian market for lambskins would also contribute to stronger lamb prices generally.</P>
      <P>Looking further ahead I believe that, while it will continue to face challenges, the Irish sheepmeat industry has many advantages, particularly in its low cost production system and natural methods of production. There is much that can be achieved in partnership to improve the future prospects of the sector. To this end I established the sheepmeat forum to evaluate the future of the sheepmeat sector and to assess how the industry can best address the constraints and future challenges facing it. The forum, which was chaired by my Department and included members from all interests connected to the sheep sector, identified a wide range of issues on all areas of the sector and agreed a comprehensive series of recommendations which, if implemented, will enable the industry to prepare for the challenges ahead. I am anxious to ensure that these recommendations are implemented as soon as possible and for that reason I have set up a monitoring committee, chaired by Dr. Frank Crosby of UCD, to progress implementations of those recommendations in the area of efficiency and quality of production and the promotion and marketing of lamb. The committee, which is representative of the various interests in the industry, will work closely with my Department. The EU regime will, of course, have an important bearing on the future prospects of the sheep sector. I accept that the EU sheepmeat regime contains many deficiencies from the point of view of Irish sheep producers and I am committed to continue to seek adjustments to that regime to ensure it better reflects the needs of the Irish sheep sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However it is important that sheep producers make maximum use of all of the EU schemes available to them to improve their income posi<Col N="1177" /> tion. Recent studies by Teagasc have shown that the income of sheep producers who participate in the rural environmental protection scheme have improved their income position quite significantly relative to those who have remained outside of the scheme. I understand that less than 50% of specialist sheep producers are involved in REPS. Those sheep producers not yet involved in REPS should give careful consideration to doing so as a way of enhancing their incomes.</P>

      <P>My Department has no plans to broaden the eligibility conditions of the current national scheme for the control of farm pollution. The scheme, introduced in June of this year, is targeted at farmers operating small to medium sized enterprises. These are deemed most in need of financial assistance in regard to their investment. I am satisfied with the level of uptake under this scheme to date.</P>
      <P>Also, a national scheme for the improvement in dairy hygiene standards was introduced in May of this year. Again, this scheme is geared to small to medium sized milk producing enterprises. The level of applicants has been less than anticipated and this issue is being reviewed in the context of drawing up the eligibility conditions for a new scheme under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>As provided for in the national development plan, my Department is currently drawing up terms and conditions for the on-farm investment measures which will operate in the period 2000-06. These include measures for the management of farm wastes and improvement of dairy hygiene standards. An amount of £147 million will be provided over the period of the plan for the scheme for the management of farm wastes to grant aid farmers for the provision of farm waste storage, winter housing for cattle and sheep, and fodder storage.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposed scheme for the Improvement of dairy hygiene standards, a sum of £28 million will be provided over the period of the national development plan. Eligibility conditions for both schemes are under active consideration by my Department in consultation with the farming organisations. These measures when finalised will be submitted to the European Commission for approval. Given the overall funding resource, it will be necessary to focus these schemes on farmers who most require assistance to enable them to carry out essential investments on their farms.</P>

      <Col N="1179" /> There is a structural surplus of apples in Europe and EU member states are not allowed to provide grant assistance for expansion of production. In addition measures were taken at EU level for grubbing up of productive orchards. There has however been an increased interest in planting cider apples in Ireland for predetermined outlets, but plantings of this sort have not yet come into full production. Apple producers have benefited from assistance for post harvest investments and from assistance for producer organisations.</P>

      <P>The recently launched national development plan sets the scene for developments in the agriculture, rural development and food areas over the next seven years. The proposed strategy builds on the outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the White Paper on Rural Development and the report of the food industry development group.</P>
      <P>Seven key areas are addressed in the plan, namely, improving farm structures; improving animal breeding, welfare, hygiene and quality; focusing on quality products and food safety at processing level and assisting the further development of the food industry; developing rural services and rural enterprise support and promoting alternative enterprises on and off farm; the provision of direct income support for farmers in designated disadvantaged areas; improving the environment and the provision of back-up research, advice and training in the agriculture, food and rural development areas.</P>
      <P>The Irish agri-food sector will face further significant challenges in the medium to longer-term, including the next WTO round and EU enlargement. These challenges will present the sector with both opportunities and threats. It was with this in mind that I established the Agri-Food 2010 Committee last May. I gave this group the task of mapping out a future strategy for the development of Irish agriculture and food. The committee is engaged in a detailed analysis of all aspects of the agri-food sector and I expect to receive their report early in the new year.</P>

      <P>I have no reason to believe there has not been general compliance by affiliated hunts with the rules and procedures governing fox hunting since their introduction by the Hunting Association of Ireland in August 1998. These rules and procedures have applied throughout the full 1998-99 hunting season and the current season to date. During that time my Department has been made aware of one specific complaint alleging breaches of these rules and procedures by a particular hunt and one anecdotal complaint. The first of these complaints has been passed to the HAI for investigation, and in the second case the complainant is being advised to take a similar course. As I pointed out in my reply to Question No. 44 on 1 July last, restrictions relating to the practices of digging out, bolting and earthstopping are specifically provided for in these rules and procedures. I am on public record as having expressed concerns in the past about such practices and I regard the introduction of and compliance with the rules and procedures as a positive and welcome advance in this regard.</P>
      <P>I again take the opportunity to emphasise the importance which I attach to ensuring there is full compliance with the rules and procedures by all concerned, that any alleged breaches are properly investigated, and that any persons found to have breached the rules and procedures are properly sanctioned by the HAI. I have received formal assurances in this regard from the HAI and its affiliated fox-hunting organisations and have made it clear that I expect such assurances to be honoured.</P>
      <P>Any person making an allegation or complaint of a breach of the rules and procedures must of course provide to the HAI supporting evidence of the alleged breach in order to facilitate proper investigation in accordance with fair procedures. It is open to a complainant to provide such information to my Department, which will pass it to HAI with a request that the matter be investigated.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of the year, my Department has approved four additional dedicated cattle ships and a roll-on/roll-off vessel for the carriage of livestock. All of the dedicated ships have been approved for transporting cattle to the Continent while two are approved for markets further afield such as the Lebanon. This brings the total number of approved dedicated ships approved for the export of cattle to 17 and the number of approved ro-ro vessels to three.</P>
      <P>It is clear from this that everything possible has been done to facilitate the carriage of livestock to our markets in Europe and the Middle East.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent figures available to my Department for cattle exports bear testament to the success of the efforts of all concerned in this regard. In particular, live cattle exports increased significantly from 49,957 head in 1997 to 145,127 head in 1998. The exports to mid-November 1999 of 377,956 is almost double the total exports for the years 1997 and 1998 combined. Of the 377,956 cattle exported to date this year, exports to the Continent amounted to 299,093. This compares <Col N="1182" /> with 120,810 in the same period last year, an increase of 147%.</P>

      <P>A new scheme of early retirement from farming is being prepared in my Department for submission to the European Commission as part of a rural development plan for the period 2000-06. The new scheme is being drawn up in accordance with the terms of EU Council Regulation 1257-99 on support for rural development.</P>
      <P>The plan must be submitted to the Commission by 4 January 2000 and the Commission will then have six months to approve it, though I will be pressing for approval at the earliest possible date. Until the plan has been approved by the Commission, it is not possible to state categorically what the terms of the new early retirement scheme will be. However, my Department's proposals will take account of the fact that the council regulation, unlike the regulation on which the present scheme is based, does not include the requirement that both the transferor and the transferee be engaged in farming as a main occupation and that the transferee enlarge the holding. I am aware that these requirements had discouraged some farmers from taking part in the existing scheme and I am glad that my efforts to have them changed were successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Climate change is recognised as a most significant global environmental problem. The Kyoto Protocol sets legally binding targets for developed countries to reduce their collective emissions of all significant greenhouse gases, based on 1990 levels, by 2010. The target for the EU is a reduction of 8% below 1990 levels and within that EU target, Ireland has a limitation target of 13% above 1990 levels.</P>
      <P>Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture in 1990 were 35% of the total national emissions. It is estimated that agriculture was responsible for approximately 80% of both methane and nitrous oxide emissions in 1990. Overall agricultural emissions are expected to fall to about 29% of the total emissions by 2010. While agriculture emissions are well within the 13% growth limit allowed to Ireland an equitable distribution of the burden sharing may require agriculture to adopt all economically feasible measures to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Policies are being looked at which will achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in an equitable manner while continuing to support economic growth. In this context a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy is being drawn up by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in consultation with other Departments including my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland also has to fulfil obligations under the UNECE Protocol to the 1979 convention on long range transboundary air pollution to abate acidification, eutrophication and ground level ozone. The objective of the protocol is to control and reduce emissions from four gases &ndash; sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic carbons and ammonia. Agriculture is the principal source <Col N="1185" /> of ammonia emissions. Compliance with the national emission ceilings is required by 2010.</P>
    <P>As the strategies for reducing emissions are at the developmental stage, it is not possible now to quantify what additional investment will be needed in the farming sector to comply with our environmental obligations.</P>
    <P>However, REPS, which has a very high uptake, has a major impact on handling and storage of farm waste. REPS is an extensification programme and requires the use of nutrient management plans in conjunction with the application of restrictions on the timing of landspreading of farm waste. The current control of farm pollution scheme also requires a nutrient management plan.</P>
    <P>Accordingly both schemes are instrumental in bringing about changes in farm practices that would have beneficial effects on meeting our environmental obligations arising from international commitments.</P>
    <P>In addition to the significant amount of payments already made to farmers under these schemes, I have secured funding in the national development plan of £1.5 billion for REPS and £147 million for waste management on farms in the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Also a code of good farming practice will be implemented as part of the new REPS programme in 2000, which will incorporate practices that should help to further reduce emissions and help to meet our international obligations.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan, funding of the order of £110 million will be available to support Leader-type activity in the period 2000-2006. Some £35.4 million of this is to be provided by the EU in respect of the Leader+ programme. The balance will come from the National Exchequer and will comprise national co-funding for Leader+ as well as support for a mainstream Leader-type measure.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusion of discussion with member states, the commission has indicated that it intends to finalise the Leader+ guidelines later this month.</P>
      <P>Pending receipt of the finalised guidelines, I am not in a position to comment on the areas in which the new programme will operate, or the basis on which groups might be approved for funding.</P>

      <P>To date in 1999, more than £121 million has been paid to sheep farmers under the ewe premium and sheep headage schemes. Payments of the top-up under the 1999 sheep headage scheme, amounting to £2.4 million, issued earlier this week. In addition, it is envisaged that payment of the Euro compensation in respect of the 1998 ewe premium amounting to an estimated £5 million will be made before Christmas. This will bring the total amount paid to sheep farmers this year to £126 million.</P>
      <P>REPS is an area based payment. The number of participants whose main or sole farming enterprise is sheep is not recorded.</P>
      <P>It is therefore not possible to state the level of payments under REPS to sheep farmers. Nationally, some £430 million has been spent to date on REPS with some 44,000 participants having received payment under the scheme.</P>

The company has informed my Department that, in the event, it did not export all of the product to Russia and the non exported quantity, which had passed its use by date, was sold on the domestic market for use as pet food.</P>
      <P>As regards the meat content of the cans put up for sale as pet food, samples were analysed by the State Laboratory at the request of my Department. The analysis shows that the cans contain a total meat content of 46.6% by weight. The Laboratory has indicated that because of the method of preparation of this product which involves high pressure and temperature treatment it is not possible for it to determine which type of meat is predominant in the sample nor can it reliably determine the percentage meat by species in this cooked product.</P>
      <P>The labelling of products and issues relating to retail sale are primarily matters for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and for the appropriate health board.</P>

    <P>Applicants for position of cleaner must be registered with FÁS and many are also registered with the National Rehabilitation Board. In the past there were many applications but in recent times it has been extremely difficult to attract suitable people to these positions. Following interviews held in September 1999, six people who were placed on a panel for cleaners turned down the <Col N="1188" /> offer of employment. Based on this direct experience, there is at present a shortage of suitable workers willing to take up these jobs.</P>
    <P>The staffing of the agencies under the aegis of my Department is a day-to-day internal matter for them and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>

      <P>A head services officer was appointed in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources during the past four years. The officer in question was recruited through a competition run by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. The salary scale for the grade rises from £261.82 to £ 328.72 per week.</P>
      <P>No other permanent appointments have been made in the Department. There have been a limited number of occasions, when it was necessary to recruit staff on temporary or part-time basis to carry out manual grade work.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in the process of recruiting a services attendant. The salary scale for the grade of services attendant increases from £171.62, under 19, to £256.16, after six years at the maximum of the scale, per week. There has been significant interest in this position, and of the 21 applicants for the position, 14 were called for interview. The qualifications and experience of applicants was deemed to be of a high standard, and it is anticipated that the successful candidate will be appointed shortly.</P>

      <P>Staff at the grades mentioned in the Deputy's question are recruited directly by the Department by means of competitive interview. In the past four years, competitions were held for service officers and cleaners in June 1996 and a competition for night watchman was held in September 1998.</P>
      <P>There were 25 applications for the service officer competition and 21 of the 23 candidates called for interview attended. All seven candidates placed on the panel were offered appointment, three refused the offer and four were appointed. Prior to the establishment of this panel, three candidates from the previous competition held in September 1994 were offered appointment and one accepted. The pay scale for this grade ranges from £171.62 for officers under the age of 19 to a maximum of £259.57 per week.</P>
      <P>The Department received 25 applications for the competition for cleaners and 12 of the 13 called for interview attended. Of the six candidates placed on the panel, five refused full-time positions and one took up a temporary position. Prior to the establishment of this panel, three candidates from the previous competition held in September 1995 were offered and accepted appointments. The pay scale for this grade ranges from £171.62 for employees under the age of 19 to a maximum of £215.85 per week.</P>
      <P>With regard to the night watchman competition, 37 of the 43 applicants were offered an interview. Of these, seven did not attend for interview, 16 were placed on the panel from which the three available positions were filled. The pay scale for these employees ranges from £193.70 to £240.22 per week.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the competition process ensured that only applicants with appropriate abilities were selected for inclusion on these panels. The Department's experience of recruiting staff at these grades is that there has been a reasonable level of response to the competitions.</P>

      <P>The charge being referred to by the Deputy is one introduced under section 54E of the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994 as inserted by section 4 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Act, 1999. The relevant provisions prescribe that off-course bookmakers must pay to the Revenue Commissioners for and on behalf of the authority by the 1 September each year a charge, in respect of each premises, of £500, £1,000 or £2,000 depending on their level of turnover at the premises up to the previous June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no pre-existing convenient system that would allow for the collection of this charge on a monthly basis. It was considered that the introduction of a special monthly collection system <Col N="1192" /> would be too cumbersome and inefficient. The lower rates were in fact introduced especially to cater for the possible difficult financial circumstances that some smaller bookmakers may find themselves in. Under the legislation the only instalment system that could be used now is one involving advance payments so that the full amount of any liability would be paid by 1 September as prescribed in the Act.</P>

      <P>Irish dairy exports have increased by 10.7% overall from 1996 to 1998. This results mainly from an increase in product going to other EU member states. Export figures for third country markets show a slight decline over the period in question. This decline is largely attributable to economic difficulties in some overseas markets, notably Russia, South-east Asia and Latin America.</P>

      <P>Following from the BSE crisis, all of the traditionally important markets for Irish beef have been re-opened. To date, Ireland is exporting beef to some 60 countries worldwide. As recently as last month, practical arrangements for the commencement of beef exports to Indonesia were finalised. A substantial <Col N="1193" /> lifting of the Russian restrictions was also negotiated in which five counties were derestricted.</P>

      <P>The recently launched national development plan sets the scene for developments in the agriculture, rural development and food areas over the next seven years. The proposed strategy builds on the outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the White Paper on Rural Development and the report of the food industry development group.</P>
      <P>Seven key areas are addressed in the plan: improving farm structures; improving animal breeding, welfare, hygiene and quality; focusing on quality products and food safety at processing level and assisting the further development of the food industry; developing rural services and rural enterprise support and promoting alternative enterprises on and off farm; the provision of direct income support for farmers in designated disadvantaged areas; improving the environment; the provision of back-up research, advice and training in the agriculture, food and rural development areas.</P>
      <P>The marketing of Irish meat of all livestock species is primarily a matter for the industry, assisted by An Bord Bia, in terms of the identification and development of new markets and the promotion of the products involved. Where appropriate, my Department plays an active role where there is a requirement for technical/ veterinary issues to be addressed as was the case in the re-opening of markets which were closed or restricted following the BSE crisis in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to beef following from the BSE crisis, all of the traditionally important markets for Irish beef have been re-opened. As regards live cattle, despite the fact that to date Libya has not yet honoured the agreement reached in July 1998 between the two Government's to resume imports from Ireland, exports this year are substantially up on those for the same period last year. The priorities now are to increase the level of beef exports to the high value EU markets, <Col N="1194" /> to focus on the secondary international markets where market access problems persist.</P>
    <P>The marketing of dairy produce is also a matter for the industry in conjunction with the Irish Dairy Board. I am not aware of any specific problems in regard to market access.</P>

      <P>Exports of sheepmeat in 1999 are estimated to be 3.5% higher than 1998. The main markets are France, which takes over 75% of our sheepmeat, Germany, United Kingdom and the Mediterranean countries, to which our lighter lambs are exported. It is estimated that exports to the latter destinations increased by over 60% this year. Our export markets are likely to be largely unchanged over the next 12 months. An Bord Bia, who have responsibility for the promotion and marketing of sheepmeat, will continue to seek new markets and are currently looking at markets in Scandinavia.</P>

      <P>The McKinsey Study, which was published in 1998, found that there is significant under used slaughtering capacity in the beef processing sector. It also concluded that there are considerable benefits to be gained from a rationalisation process leading to a better matching of capacity with actual requirements. The beef task force recommended that the industry itself should address this problem by providing buy-out facilities to expedite the rationalisation process, which would have regard to regional balance and competition for cattle.</P>
      <P>The task force also recommended that significant public funding should be provided under the next round of the Structural Funds for the support of a major development programme for the beef industry in the context of a better matching of slaughtering capacity with cattle supplies. Under the national development plan, the Government has decided to give priority to capital investment in the beef sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of developments in the pigmeat sector following a fire at a Northern Ireland pig processing plant and the consequent effects on the <Col N="1195" /> incomes of those producers who had supplied that plant, I have asked Enterprise Ireland to examine the structure of the pig processing industry and to report back at the earliest possible date. The outcome of this study will provide a basis for assessing whether or not the sector currently has adequate capacity in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In the sheepmeat sector, there is also some overcapacity in the slaughtering area. The provision of boning and packing facilities, which adds value to the basic product, is an ongoing process which has been assisted by public funding under the Structural Funds. Ongoing investment in this area, in response to the demands of the marketplace is envisaged.</P>
    <P>As regards the poultry sector, there are currently 23 EU export approved slaughtering plants and I am satisfied that sufficient slaughtering, processing and ancillary facilities are in place to meet the needs of that industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to introduce further improvements in the tax treatment of older people, the following taxation provisions have been made in Budget 2000 for elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age exemption limits for those aged 65 and over will be increased by £1,000 single/£2,000 married, so that the threshold for elderly people entering the tax net is now £7,500 single/£15,000 married, equivalent to £144 per week single/£288 per week married. This means that in my three budgets I have increased the exemption limits for the elderly by up to two-thirds. The new increases will take almost 10,000 taxpayers aged 65 and over out of the tax net. The age allowance, which <Col N="1198" /> is available to taxpayers aged 65 and over, will be doubled to £800 single/£1,600 married and standard rated. This will benefit standard rate taxpayers by up to £80 single/£160 married per annum. Rent relief for those aged 55 and over will be doubled to £2,000 single/£3,000 widowed/£4,000 married and standard rated. Since 80 per cent of those on the relief are standard rate taxpayers, this amounts in effect to a doubling of the relief for four out of five claimants.</P>
    <P>People aged 65 and over will also benefit from the general changes in taxation announced in the Budget, that is, the 2% reduction in both the standard and top rates of tax, the widening of the standard rate tax bands for single-two earner married couples and the increase in the personal allowances by £500 single/£1,000 married. Where applicable they will also be able to benefit from the increases in the widowed persons allowance.</P>
    <P>As I have stated in my budget speech, older people have been and remain a priority. On the social welfare side, the principal rate improvement in respect of older people within the context of budget 2000 is the increase of £7 per week in the full personal rate of old age and related pensions. There is a weekly increase of £4.70 for the qualified adult allowance on retirement and old age contributory pensions for those over 66 years. This represents an £11.70 weekly increase for old age contributory pensioner couples. There is a special catch-up increase of £7.50 for the qualified adult allowance of non-contributory old age pensioners, giving a total increase of £14.50 for those couples. The weekly payment increases are to be paid four weeks earlier. On the non-rates side, a change was made in the method of assessing capital for the means test for entitlement to social assistance payments, other than for unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. The free schemes are to be extended to all people over 75 years regardless of income and household composition. The tapered withdrawal of qualified adult allowance is improved and extended to old age contributory pensions and retirement pensions. Widows and widowers with the fuel allowance will be able to retain it when transferring to the old age contributory pension. The Social Welfare Bill will include measures to improve the position of those whose pensions are affected by present treatment of pre-1953 social insurance contributions.</P>

      <Quest>the position with DIRT on the savings of old age pensioners and widows over 66; the process of getting a refund; the persons who qualify; the cost if this concession was extended to all special savings accounts of persons over 66; the cost if extended to all pensioners paying tax at standard rate; and if he will implement these concessions in view of the harsh treatment of pensioners' savings.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the elderly in relation to DIRT deducted from ordinary deposit accounts and special savings accounts is that the over-65's are entitled to a refund of DIRT paid if their total income, including interest income, is below the income exemption thresholds. Concessionary treatment is, therefore, already afforded to these individuals in the administration of DIRT where their income falls outside the tax net. With effect from 6 April 2000, the age allowance, under the income tax code, which is available to taxpayers aged 65 or over is being doubled from £400 per annum single and widowed and £800 per annum married to £800 and £1,600 respectively but will be available at the standard rate of income tax only. The full year cost of this is estimated at £6.8 million. In addition, the standard DIRT tax rate will be reduced from 24% to 22% from 6 April next.</P>
      <P>The claim for repayment of DIRT is made after the end of the year of assessment. The individual completes a claim form and sends it, together with the certificates of interest which are issued by the deposit taker, to his or her local inspector of taxes.</P>
      <P>The claim form is automatically issued to those individuals who have been identified from the records of the Revenue Commissioners as being likely to qualify for repayment. Forms are also available from all tax offices.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant information indicates that some 23,000 individuals aged 65 and over who were liable to income tax for 1996-97 were identified as having interest income to which DIRT applied. On the basis of these figures it is estimated that if all DIRT deducted from the deposit interest of persons aged 65 and over was repaid regardless of their liability to tax, the estimated cost to the Exchequer would be of the order of £8.5 million in respect of DIRT deducted at the standard rate and £150,000 for DIRT deducted at the rate for special savings accounts which is 20%.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce proposals for additional modifications of the main features of the DIRT system.</P>

    <P>A national survey of vacancies in almost 1,100 firms in private sector manufacturing and services carried out by the ESRI in Autumn 1998 for FÁS and Forfás indicated that there was a strong upward trend in the vacancy rate for the manufacturing sector and that this was probably the case also for the services sector. The survey found that as the demand for labour increases employees have a wide range of job opportunities from which to choose. Consequently, firms may experience difficulties retaining staff as well as gaining new recruits. With the exception of clerical jobs the occupations for which it was most difficult to retain staff were in skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled positions whereas the jobs for which it was most difficult to recruit were in intermediate and highly skilled positions. This upward trend in vacancies is likely to have continued since autumn 1998 given the strength of the economy and employment growth &ndash; the unemployment rate has fallen from 6.5% in November 1998 to 5.1% in November 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited was a private company which went into voluntary liquidation in 1987. In 1988 the Government decided that the unclaimed prize money of swepstakes promoted by Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited should be used to benefit former employees. In December 1990 the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act, 1990, enabled the then Minister for Health to take over approximately £481,000 in unclaimed sweepstake prize money, together with accrued interest, for distribution to former employees of the company.</P>
      <P>The money was distributed to the two categories of former employees of the Hospital's Trust (1940) Limited generally regarded as being the most seriously disadvantaged when the company ceased trading. The two groups were: former employees still living who opted for early retirement in 1978 or later and from whom an<i> ex-gratia</i> element of pension entitlement was withdrawn in 1987 and former employees still living who were made redundant when the company was placed in voluntary liquidation in 1987.</P>
      <P>Spouses of deceased persons belonging to either of the above categories were eligible to receive the amount which the deceased person would have been qualified to receive. Persons in category 1 received a flat rate payment of £1,000. The balance of moneys available after category 1 payments were finalised was distributed among persons in category 2 on the age and service weighted basis used to calculate statutory redundancy payments. The money was distributed in 1990 and 1991 to 282 persons on receipt of valid application forms. These payments were made on a once-off basis as part of a special arrangement at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The records currently available in my Depart<Col N="1204" /> ment indicate that the person referred to by the Deputy did not benefit from this distribution of unclaimed prize money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are empowered by law to acquire land compulsorily for the purposes of carrying out any of their powers, duties and functions. A local authority acquiring land compulsorily may be authorised to do so by means of a compulsory purchase order made by the authority and submitted to and confirmed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Notice of the making of the CPO must be published and served on the parties having an interest in the land affected by it. When this is done, the CPO is submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for confirmation. The Minister may annul the order or confirm it, with or without modification. If objections are made to the Minister by the owners, lessees and occupiers, not being tenants for a month or less of the lands and the objections do not relate solely to matters affecting compensation, the Minister, unless he decides to annul the order, must arrange for the holding of a public local inquiry into the objections. Before deciding whether or not to confirm the order he must consider the objections made and the report of the person who held the inquiry. The administration of a confirmed CPO is a matter for the local authority concerned.</P>
      <P>The amount of compensation payable by local authorities for land acquired by them under a CPO is solely a matter for negotiation between the landowner and the local authority concerned and the Minister has no function in the matter. In the event of dispute, either party has recourse to the land values reference committee for the appointment of an official property arbitrator to determine the case.</P>
      <P>Once an order is confirmed and the requisite notices given the local authority may serve a notice to treat and, on giving at least 14 days notice to the owners etc., may take possession of the land for the purposes for which it was acquired, and any dispute about compensation can be determined afterwards.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill, 1999, will, when enacted, transfer the Minister's functions to An Bord Pleanála and bring about other changes designed to streamline the CPO process.</P>
      <P>My Department has no role in relation to CPOs other than those made by local authorities.</P>

This review was carried out in consultation with the National Roads Authority and local authorities and took account of representations received from a wide range of local interests. There are accordingly no proposals for significant changes in the national road network in the short-term. Traffic patterns will, however, continue to be monitored in order to identify any long-term changes which might have implications for the classified system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>The details sought by the Deputy are available only from end-December 1997 and are shown in the following table. They include the total number of persons on the live register adjusted to take account of those people who are not entitled to a payment in respect of a full week's unemployment, namely those signing for credits only; casual workers, those receiving a payment for part of a week and in employment for the remainder, others not entitled to a payment &ndash; claims awaiting decision, suspended etc.</P>
      <P>Data before the end of December 1997 are limited because statistical data on sub-categories within the live register were not then collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The projected average live register for 2000 is 170,000 and the average cost of unemployment <Col N="1211" /> payments per 1000 persons on the live register, allowing for increases in payments provided for in the budget, is £3.9 million.</P>
    <P>The average cost per annum of every 1000 persons on the live register who are actually in receipt of a payment for full weeks of unemployment is estimated at £4.47 million. Fully unemployed persons may also qualify for additional benefits such as rent subsidy, fuel allowance and payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme but information as to the average cost of these payments for such persons is not available.</P>

      <P>The statistical information requested by the Deputy in relation to the appointment of services officers, services attendants and cleaners to my Department and to agencies under my Department's control, is furnished in the following tabular statements.</P>
      <P>Services officer positions in the Dublin offices of my Department are filled internally by the promotion of suitable staff from the services attendant and cleaner grades. Otherwise, appointments to the services grades are made by way of a selection process, usually from amongst those nominated by FÁS or the National Rehabilitation Board as being suitable for employment in Government offices and, occasionally, from amongst others, for instance, those who have been employed on a temporary basis by the Department.</P>
      <P>While there has in the past generally been a good response to recruitment from among those nominated by these agencies, there is a changing trend which is demonstrated by the statistics in relation to a recent competition for cleaning grades in Dublin. In that case, only 17 out of 57 persons invited to apply for positions as services attendants and cleaners completed application forms, of which 12 subsequently attended for interview.</P>
      <P>The selection interview process is qualifying and competitive and only those considered suitable for appointment are placed on panels from which appointments are made.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> The salaries in these cases range from £171 per week at the minimum of the lowest scale to £280 at maximum of the highest scale.</P>
    <P>My Department also employs a large number of industrial staff spanning over 30 grades-grade groupings. At peak this year &ndash; June &ndash; some 1220 were employed and at low season &ndash; February &ndash; some 850 were employed. In any year over 400 are recruited for a variety of permanent and seasonal positions. Industrial pay rates vary widely but the basic pay for the main grades ranges between £180 and £404 approximately.</P>
    <P>There are significant variations between the level of application for the different positions, depending on the skills required and economic and geographic factors. In the majority of cases it is possible to fill vacancies but in some instances posts are currently unfilled due to the absence of suitable candidates in particular locations. These tend to be for skilled craft positions, where pay rates in the private sector exceed the public service pay levels. My Department is seeking to address these recruitment difficulties both in the short and longer term. In the case of the latter, for instance, it is planned to expand our existing apprenticeship schemes.</P>
    <P>Compiling information on competitions held for industrial workers over the past four years, 1996-1999, would not be justified given the inordinate amount of staff time required to carry out the task.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, as Minister, I do not get involved in the day-to-day working of the agencies under the control of my Department.</P>

      <P>In the 17 year period since 1982 a total of 93 serving and retired members of the Garda Síochána have lodged claims for hearing loss against the State. To put this in context, the Department of Defence has received approximately 14,600 deafness claims.</P>
      <P>Of these 93 cases, 12 claims have been settled at a cost of £317,580. This represents an average settlement of £26,465 per case. A Supreme Court decision on 7 December in relation to the level of awards in army hearing loss cases is likely to significantly reduce the overall cost of these claims. Two claims have been withdrawn and 79 are pending.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the number of gardaí currently trained in the use of firearms is 3,900. Members undergoing training in the use of firearms must attend a refresher course on three occasions per year. It is important to note that since March 1983 each member who attends a firearms course is issued with ear defenders and instructed in their use. The wearing of ear defenders is compulsory at all times when on the firing range or within the vicinity of the firing range.</P>
      <P>Instructors attached to firearms section are routinely tested for deafness. These tests are carried out on an annual basis at the Garda depot hospital. Instructors are required to refrain from attending a firing range for a period of 48 hours prior to undergoing this test.</P>

      <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation was established in July 1997.

      <P>Intake policy is primarily a matter for individual school authorities, subject to acceptable criteria being applied. My Department's main responsibility in any given area is to ensure that, overall, there is adequate accommodation to meet the demand for pupil places.</P>
      <P>Accommodation for 1,100 pupils is being provided by my Department at Castleknock community college It is expected that the overall project will be finalised for September 2000.</P>
      <P>In addition to Castleknock community college, there are currently five post primary schools operating in the general Dublin 15 area. I am aware that there is pressure on accommodation in some of these schools, including the community college. This pressure is due, mainly, to extensive housing developments in the area and, in some part, to parents exercising choice in selecting schools for their children.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present, closely examining the need for additional accommodation at primary and post primary level in the Dublin 15 area. As part of this examination officials of the planning and building unit will endeavour to ensure that optimum use is being made of existing facilities. This will help to determine the appropriate amount and location for any additional facilities which may be required to meet the needs of the area.</P>

      <P>My officials have investigated the individual cases referred to, together with a small number of similar cases involving students from Donegal attending courses in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The students in question applied, and were eligible, for maintenance grants from Donegal VEC in the 1998-99 academic year. The students were also, however, advised, in error, that they would also qualify for assistance from the VEC towards the recently introduced tuition fees. It has been established that the appropriate Education and Library Board in Northern Ireland will not provide assistance towards fees for these students in <Col N="1219" /> respect of the 1998-99 academic year. In the circumstances of these cases, approval for the payment of the relevant fees for the 1998-99 academic year as an exceptional once-off matter has been conveyed to County Donegal VEC.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill which was recently passed at Second Stage by this House, provides a comprehensive framework to promote school attendance and deal with associated issues. The legislation also provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board, which will have responsibility for advising the Minister in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This draft legislation recognises the important work currently being carried out by home-school liaison officers, and integrates them into this new framework for the promotion of school attend<Col N="1220" /> ance. Section 22 of the Bill provides statutory recognition for the role of a range of school personnel, including home-school liaison co-ordinators, and other personnel in the preparation of strategies and measures to foster an appreciation of learning among students. A primary function of the liaison co-ordinators is the development of partnership between parents and teachers in the interests of the children's learning. This involves the provision of such supports as the parents identify to develop their confidence and abilities in this vital collaborative role. The Bill, therefore, provides that the liaison co-ordinators shall have an important role in the preparation of an individual school's statement of strategy to foster an appreciation of learning and encourage regular school attendance amongst the school pupils. They will also have an important role in developing the parents' active involvement in the identification, preparation and delivery of effective strategies.</P>
    <P>More generally, I would envisage that home-school liaison officers will collaborate with educational welfare officers and teachers within the overall context of the Education (Welfare) Bill to promote school attendance within our schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the current school year 190 second level schools have been allocated disadvantaged posts and qualify for disadvantaged status on that basis.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantage status should be confined to 16% of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17% of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>While I have no proposals at present for designating further schools as disadvantaged, I can assure the Deputy that the position of St. Angela's school will receive full consideration in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged scheme.</P>
      <P>The authorities of St. Angela's school may apply for an increase in the approved teacher allocation to cater for particular circumstances. Applications of this nature are considered under the curricular appeal process and each case is considered on its merits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>There are currently an estimated 400,000,000 speakers of Spanish in 21 countries across the world. This makes Spanish speakers the second largest group after speakers of Chinese. English speakers are at present in third place.</P>
      <P>Neither the number of speakers of a language worldwide nor the number of people holidaying in a certain country, in themselves, constitute reasons for making the learning of that language an education priority. There are other valid factors governing policy in the matter, for example, personal taste, proximity of the learners to the country in which the language is spoken, availability of teachers, third level study plans and plans to seek employment abroad.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am not satisfied with the fact that only 3,690 candidates sat Spanish in the 1999 public examinations, 2,131 at junior certificate and 1,559 at leaving certificate level. I am taking the following steps to address the matter.</P>
      <P>I have just recently appointed a full-time inspector of Spanish. This single measure has already had an empowering effect on the Spanish learning and teaching community.</P>

    <P>I have ensured that Spanish is taught in a number of primary schools participating in the modern languages &ndash; primary &ndash; initiative. At present, 53 of the 287 participating schools teach the lang<Col N="1223" /> uage. This measure will increase demand for the teaching of Spanish at second level.</P>
    <P>An initiative targeted specifically at increasing the uptake of Spanish and Italian, and introducing Japanese, will commence shortly. My Department is currently working on the details of this initiative. It will include in-service for the teachers of Spanish already in the system as well as increasing present capacity for teaching the language within the second level system.</P>
    <P>I am in discussion with the Spanish Embassy about the possibility of appointing a larger number of language assistants for Spanish, of whom there are currently five working in Irish schools. Up to now the number of students taking Spanish did not warrant an increase. When the initiative targeting lesser-taught languages at second level is in place it will certainly be possible to re-examine the situation. Student exchange programmes could also be part of this initiative.</P>
    <P>My Department's in-career development unit funds in-service provided by the Spanish Teachers Association for teachers of Spanish at second level. Proposals from course organisers for additional in-service support to meet the identified needs of Spanish teachers will be considered in a positive way.</P>
    <P>In the university sector, there is opportunity to study Spanish on its own and in conjunction with other subjects in all seven universities as part of the following undergraduate programmes:</P>

    <P>Student exchange opportunities at third level occur under the aegis of the EU Socrates-Erasmus programme. In the academic year 1998-99 a total of 173 students in the third level sector travelled to Spain as part of this programme.</P>
    <P>According to the information available to me in relation to the technological sector Spanish is taught to students in five institutes of technology, namely, Athlone, Cork, Galway-Mayo, Tallaght and Waterford. Should further information become available I will forward it to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other that mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties that these provisions can give rise to in individual cases and I have asked my Department to examine the issues concerned.</P>

      <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school textbooks. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of schoolbooks to parents.</P>
      <P>The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in primary and post-primary schools. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance misuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Special grants are provided to schools at second level, which are categorised as disadvantaged, to assist them in the establishment of book loan-rental schemes. At primary level schools that opt for book rental schemes are allocated enhanced grants to encourage schools to participate in such schemes.</P>
      <P>School textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level, apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects. Decisions as to which books to use are taken at school level. School authorities have been advised regularly that textbooks should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary. Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over frequent changes, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. Textbooks require to be changed periodically, however, to enable teachers to keep their own and their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to introduce a system of approved book lists at either first or second levels. However, I will continue to urge all schools to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have recently announced the allocation of approximately £3.7 million to primary and £2.8 million to second level schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. A circular on this matter has been issued to schools by my Department.</P>
