      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I will travel to New York tomorrow evening, 10 November, where I will undertake a number of engagements before returning on Friday, 12 November. During my visit, I will address both the National Committee on US Foreign Policy and the Irish Business Organisation. I will also host a breakfast meeting for members of the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board. In addition, I will meet the Governor of New York, Mr. George Pataki, and Mayor Giuliani. I will visit the Consulate General of Ireland in Ireland House and meet the heads of Irish State Agency New York Offices. A comprehensive press programme includes meeting both mainstream New York and the Irish American media.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach list the people who will travel with him to New York? Will he spend some of his time in New York on private fundraising efforts for Fianna Fáil? If so, has he considered refunding the £25,000 from the Leader's allowance which was used to pay off the debts or some of the debts of a member of the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>
      <P>What will be the private end of the Taoiseach's visit? Is he breaking his public visit on behalf of the country to do a couple of functions? I understand that is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>By Government jet. I will attend one private function. I will meet members of the Fianna Fáil committee. I do not even know if it will be a fundraiser; it is a very small group. If it is, what we normally do is give a contribution towards the costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach mean that if he will do some private work, he will give a contribution to the costs of the Government jet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not do any private work. I do not consider work for Fianna Fáil as private work. When I go to New York I normally meet the Fianna Fáil committee. Once a year we normally do a fundraiser in New York. We will not do that, as it happens, this year but I will meet the Fianna Fáil group and some people with it. If that meeting turns out to be a fundraiser, as I have said in the House before, we normally give a contribution towards the costs of the trip. However, in this case my trip is not for party purposes. My trip has another purpose, as the Deputy will see from the programme and from what is going on at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach confirming to the House that whatever function he might attend on behalf of Fianna Fáil involves meeting a small Fianna Fáil group and perhaps some people who might pay some small donation for meeting him, and that there will not be a major fundraising dinner, function or functions despite the fact that people have been asked to functions? The functions may have collapsed now, but my information is that there have been invitations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach met the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board when he was there for St. Patrick's Day. Would it not be more appropriate for it to travel to Ireland for this meeting? Why did the Taoiseach feel it necessary to go to America to meet these people seeing that last year he indicated that he hoped that group would come to Ireland? Does he think it would be more appropriate for the group to come to Ireland to examine the kind of projects in which he hoped it might have become involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to two matters because I do not want to mislead the Deputy. This is an official trip. I have not been in New York since I was elected Taoiseach almost two and a half years ago although I have met the advisory board in Washington. There will be one short period where I will meet some of the Fianna Fáil committee. I assume the committee, as it normally does, could invite other people to meet me. If the committee raises any money on those occasions, we normally give a contribution towards the costs and we will do that again if that is the case in this instance. It is usually a small sum because we are not as lucky as other parties in the House who can raise big money in New York &ndash; I believe the Deputy's party is very successful in that regard also. However, that is not the primary purpose of such functions. We do not have an annual dinner this year in New York but one took place last year and the year before.</P>
      <P>The New York advisory group visited Ireland last year and I met its representatives in March. It is not its intention to return here this year but it hopes to do so next year. During the past ten years various Taoisigh have met representatives of the group when visiting New York or Washington.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Taoiseach his powers of recollection. In a reply to a Parliamentary Question on a previous occasion, he stated that it was agreed&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;at his meeting on March 18 with representatives of the Ireland-American Economic Fund that the next meeting of the fund would take place in Ireland. Why has the plan changed and why will the Taoiseach travel to New York to meet them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy states that I am merely travelling to New York to meet representatives of the fund. On my arrival I will have a press breakfast at 9 a.m. with the Irish-American media in Fitzpatrick's Hotel, at 11.45 a.m. I will meet the New York Editorial Board, at 1.15 p.m. I have an interview with CNN International, at 2,30 p.m. I will meet Mayor Giuliani, I have an interview with RTE at 4 p.m., at 5 p.m. I will attend a Fianna Fáil function for one hour and I will then meet the Irish Business Organisation. I will also have a series of meetings on the following day including those with the Irish America <Col N="448" /> Economic Advisory Board, the heads of Irish State agencies in New York in the Consulate General's office, I will then give a number of interviews with various interview groups, meet Governor Pataki, have lunch with the American Committee on Foreign Policy, give a number of further interviews and then return home.</P>
      <P>I will not travel to New York with the express purpose of meeting representatives of the group to which the Deputy referred but I will meet them while I am there. As the Deputy is aware, these people work on a voluntary basis and they do not receive expenses. When they visit Ireland, I meet them and I also meet them if I am travelling abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My visit, not merely the meetings with the three prestigious groups to which I referred, will be of significant benefit. As Deputy Quinn is aware, the advisory board is of significant value to this country and provides great help in attracting foreign investment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to update the various groups and bodies, including the media, on the current position in respect of the peace process. I also hope to outline what is happening in foreign direct investment. The Deputy will be aware that views have been expressed at international level <Col N="449" /> regarding the path the country will take in the coming years. All of my speeches to these three major bodies, which represent several hundred business organisations, will outline the current state of our economy and society and our plans for the future. In the two day period I will attract enormous exposure for the country. Most of my television interviews will probably deal not with the economy but will concentrate on the peace process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach be informing the Irish-American Economic Advisory Board of the advice the Tánaiste has given to American companies wishing to invest in Dublin, namely, that they are not welcome? Will the Taoiseach tell the group, on behalf of the Irish Government, that foreign direct investment in the Dublin region has reached saturation point and that if it is contemplating&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he is going to America to meet the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board. I am asking if he will tell the board what the Tánaiste told a group from Wexford about investment in the Dublin region. Will he say to the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board that, as far as foreign direct investment from North America is concerned, Dublin has reached saturation point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This year we have attracted a quarter of the foreign direct investment into Europe. That is an extraordinary achievement which I hope can be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain in detail, as I always do in the United States, the benefits of being part of the Irish economy. The references made by the Tánaiste relate to changes after Objective One and grant aid which now exist in Dublin as against other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the case that direct investment into Dublin will cease. I will not try to stop people coming to Dublin, but I will explain the benefits of the Government's policy of regional and balanced development, to try to move industries around the country. We are completing the global cross-connectivity cable from the United States which gives us the opportunity to generate more activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also hope to put an end to the fallacy that we are short of people. The reality is that the Irish labour market will continue to grow at 4 per cent for the next decade while the rest of the EU will grow at 2 per cent. A number of issues have been <Col N="450" /> gaining strength, for obvious reasons, in the last few months and I will address them also.</P>

      <P>In keeping with what was agreed last March when he chaired a meeting there, is the Taoiseach going there at the invitation of the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board and is he taking with him a list of the further infrastructure programmes he hopes this body will support?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I follow the precedent set by Taoisigh over the past ten years: whenever the individuals of the advisory board come here on their own business &ndash; five or six have come this year &ndash; I encourage them to continue to assist, and they do. I place on record my thanks to them. Some new members have been recruited onto the economic advisory board whom I have not met yet &ndash; a number of them were not present at the meeting in March. These are people who have been approached by our ambassador or consul to assist the effort. I will talk to them about a number of issues and make them aware of the national development plan. They are also anxious about public private partnership.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for my Department was voted by Dáil Éireann on 30 June 1999 and amounts to £32,233,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision within the Vote for two grants-in-aid, one for the National Economic and <Col N="451" /> Social Council and one for the National Economic and Social Forum. These amount to £464,000 each. An amount of £348,000 has been paid over to the NESC and a total of £204,000 has been paid to the NESF to date this year. Grant funding was made available by my Department this year in three areas. First, £14.9 million was allocated to projects related to the millennium celebrations. This funding is administered by my Department through the National Millennium Committee and funds are allocated subject to the relevant criteria. A total of £1,301,275 has been spent to date in respect of millennium projects.</P>
    <P>An amount of £800,000 was made available this year from the Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, for projects involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole. An interdepartmental assessment committee, chaired by my Department, has allocated funding to projects under these headings subject to the relevant criteria for the award of such grants. A total of £472,920 has been paid out to date. An amount of £400,000 was made available in the Estimate for commemoration initiatives, with a total of £131,500 paid this year to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is funding included in the Estimate for the continuation of the group set up by the Taoiseach to examine taxi and hackney issues? He indicated that £14.9 million is available for millennium projects, of which only £1.3 million approximately has been spent. Will the remainder of the money that has been set aside for such projects be spent before the millennium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxi committee concluded its work last year and, therefore, no money has been allocated to it &ndash; it received very little in the first place. All the money for millennium projects must be spent before the end of next year. To date, grants totalling £1.301 million have been paid for the millennium festival, Míle Átha Cliath, the millennium book, the logo and other projects. It is hoped that a number of others, such as the Messiah project, will be paid before Christmas. The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, who is responsible for this, said last week that within accountancy procedures he will examine which funding can be carried over for projects not already dealt with.</P>

      <P>The NESC report, which has just been published, and the supplementary publications, all of which have not yet been published, will deal comprehensively with that issue and I support them. The Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion has dealt with a number of projects in this area, which have led to a number of good publications. NESF is involved in detailed monitoring of initiatives, particularly those related to the long-term unemployed, poverty and social exclusion, which are also very good. There is a great deal of work taking place in this area and the more that can be supported by everybody the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, and 6 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated previously to the House, the working group on basic income commissioned a study to be carried out in two phases. The overall purpose of the study is to consider and evaluate the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system. Phase one of the study, which covers the costs and distributional aspects of basic income and entails a considerable amount of detailed analysis of costings, taxation and social welfare matters, is virtually completed.</P>
      <P>When the draft report on phase one was considered by the working group, it identified a number of modifications to the basic income structure being analysed. This was envisaged in the terms of reference for phase one. The further analysis required as a result has been carried out by the ESRI and the results and the final report on phase one are expected later this month or at least before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work is well under way on the second phase of the study which will evaluate the economic, <Col N="453" /> social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system. I understand that the working group met to review progress in the past few days, and that the study is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not mention phase three in his reply. Will he indicate when he thinks the work of this group will be completed and when the Government will make decisions on it? Will the Taoiseach agree, given that the Government is committed to introducing a minimum wage by April 2000, that the first £170 per week should be tax free for every person in the State? There is no point in introducing a minimum wage and taking half of it back by way of tax. The Fine Gael proposal is for £170 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is to be passed by the House on the minimum wage. There is no phase 3. Given that there has to be a green paper on this issue, that might be called phase 3. Following the meeting of recent days I think the work will be finished by the end of the year. The work has been very complex; the more they have gone into it, the more questions are raised. It has been useful work and it will be a useful study. As soon as that work is finished we will look at ways of advancing it and agreeing it with the social partners because it is an initiative under Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government taken a decision on the CORI proposal, which would allow for a basic income to be paid irrespective of whether a person was in receipt of a social welfare payment which was below the basic income? This is an issue which concerns CORI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This work arises out of the CORI proposal. This is what initiated the effort under Partnership 2000. The CORI proposal included the creation of a social solidarity fund. The idea was that additional payments would be made to those who were previously on social welfare so that no one on a low income would lose out on the introduction of a basic income. One of the proposals will be to see how that actually works in effect. In fairness to CORI and the people involved, nobody quite knows how that will happen. That is why the study has been so complex. We have to await he findings of the study to see if that proposal works in the way people thought it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has correctly said this initiative arose from commitments within Partnership 2000. Is it the Government's intention that the findings of this working group will be referred back to the social partners? If so, will the findings include an analysis of the impact of the establishment of a basic income proposal in the context of Ireland being part of a single European market and in the context of the free move<Col N="454" /> ment of labour and European citizens across a population base of 373 million people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps people might be interested in the final analysis to see how it will operate. As the working group is made up of the social partners, all the analysis is going back to them. They have been raising the questions and analysing them. I spent some time looking at the study because it so different from anything we have tried in this country before. It is said to be very far-ranging while others have said it is nonsense. I think it is a study well worth doing. It evaluates not only the figures but looks at the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system. It also looks at what one can yield from a basic income system here. I honestly do not know how it will all work out &ndash; the winners and the losers and the pluses and minuses at the end of the day &ndash; nor can anybody else. If the study is a model, it will be of interest to others. Everybody has doubts and reservations and nobody is sure how successful it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach took me up incorrectly or I may not have phrased the question accurately. Is it within the terms of reference of this study that if a basic income system is introduced in the Republic any European citizen, legally resident in the European Union and capable of exercising his rights with regard to free movement of labour under the Single European Act, would be entitled to the benefits of a basic income, similar to that enjoyed by an Irish citizen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it would but it has not been included in the terms of reference. The position of those on low incomes, enduring hardship, who are disadvantaged and not gaining the benefits will, however, be looked at in the report. Those on welfare would fall within these categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>From his knowledge of the guaranteed basic income scheme, what would the Taoiseach say are the advantages? Does he agree with the Conference of Religious in Ireland that such a scheme would do much to eliminate poverty traps and with its assessment that Ireland is a low-tax state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some who do and some who do not. It all depends on who one is and where one is in the system. If one is in a low-paid job and drifts into the higher tax band one does not believe that taxation rates are low.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it does if it employs a small number of staff. There are a few which fall into this category. It is an extremely complex <Col N="455" /> area. No one involved in the working group has yet declared that such a scheme would work. We have to await its report. CORI conducted much research and it was worth the effort. The previous Government took the initiative in Partnership 2000 which I have followed. We have had to go to a university either in New Zealand or the United States to find someone to work on it. The theory is that basic income would be taxable at a flat rate but it is acknowledged by everyone that there would be huge losers and gainers. That would not be equitable. This aspect has to be studied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the working group is happy with the report &ndash; I have honoured the commitment to at least look at the matter &ndash; we will look at the possibility of publishing a Green Paper on basic income. This would take some time as there are many issues which have not been looked at in the first part of the study.</P>

      <P>I had a very useful meeting with Mr. Donald Dewar, First Minister of Scotland, on Friday, 29 October. The meeting provided an opportunity for a wide-ranging discussion on matters of mutual interest on political, economic and cultural levels. Both of us recognised the potential benefits arising from the British-Irish Council and of close co-operation in areas where our interests coincide. We agreed that in whatever wider context, there should be a process whereby information could be shared on these issues and that closer co-operation should be developed.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the answer and for the reiteration of the commitment about the British-Irish Council, including Scotland. What credence does the Taoiseach give to the statements over the weekend that the IRA is about to implement some form of decommissioning?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The process is almost complete. Senator Mitchell is engaged with the parties. Needless to say, I am reasonably well briefed on what is happening and the stage at which the discussions are currently, but they are extremely delicate. It could take a number of days or a number of weeks to bring them to a conclusion &ndash; I hope it will be a number of days because I do not think Senator Mitchell can give much more time to the process. Hopefully, over the next period the position will become clear. Senator Mitchell has committed himself to giving his best assessment as soon as the process is finished. I do not want to say anything that&mdash;</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach a very specific question. It was rumoured over the weekend <Col N="459" /> that the IRA was about to enter into what was called technical decommissioning. What credence does the Taoiseach give to that because obviously that is crucial to whether Senator Mitchell's work will be completed satisfactorily? Is there some element of hope that there will be some decommissioning, which is being hinted at? I realise the Taoiseach has to be sensitive in what he says but could he at least give us some idea?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Taoiseach's concern about ensuring that any comments made at this time are deemed to be constructive. It is against that background that I pose the following question to him. By way of illustration to the rest of the Irish community and the broader community, will he outline to the House what the circumstances would be if Senator Mitchell were to, in a matter of weeks or days, give a final report back to the two heads of Government to the effect that the review had ended in failure and that progress was not possible? That is not a prospect to which I look forward; on the contrary, I hope positive progress can be made. However, the alternative needs to be posed to all Members of this House and others. What options would be open to the Irish and British Governments if Senator Mitchell were to, regretfully, report that the final bridge could not be crossed and that progress could not be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the constructive way in which the question was put. Needless to say, we will do everything we possibly can to assist Senator Mitchell and all the pro-Agreement parties, and all other parties for that matter, to try to reach a successful conclusion. Without going into it step by step, if that were the case, both Governments would have to receive that report and immediately try to engage with the pro-Agreement parties to see how aspects of the Good Friday Agreement could continue to be implemented. There has been agreement throughout the discussions over the past year or so that, while it would be extremely difficult, we would have to endeavour to continue to implement and operate as much as possible of, and in as comprehensive a way as possible, the legislative base, human rights issues and many other aspects. However, it would be difficult. The Deputy already knows what has been stated about the difficulties there would be for the Patten commission and North-South matters if there was no agreement. We could try, in an <i>ad hoc <Col N="460" /></i>way, to develop those, because they would be right in their own way, but it would be very difficult to do so without the institutional mechanisms. I assure the House we would immediately put all our efforts into doing that. However, at this stage, we are concentrating our efforts on trying to get a successful outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that is the case and I urge the Taoiseach &ndash; not that he needs urging from me &ndash; to ensure such a satisfactory outcome is arrived at. Nevertheless, in the event that such an outcome does not obtain, are the Irish and British Governments empowered to proceed to enact the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement to ensure that Articles 2 and 3 would be changed in line with the wish of the electorate, as expressed last May?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to return, for clarification purposes, to a question the Taoiseach answered. In reply to my question about Articles 2 and 3, the Taoiseach said that change can only be implemented if the Good Friday Agreement is implemented. Certain components of the Good Friday Agreement have already been implemented. In light of the progress that has been made where, while there was a failure to establish an Executive, Ministers have continued to have responsibility for Northern Ireland and there is the prospect of a North-South dimension, is it the Government's view that Articles 2 and 3 could be changed to bring them into line with the wishes expressed by 95 per cent of the people of the Republic of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to give a loose reply to that. I stated that the people who voted on this issue, particularly those in the Republic, were asked to agree to the amendment to the Constitution on the basis of the full implemen<Col N="461" /> tation of the Good Friday Agreement. That was the basis on which we sold this issue during extensive campaigning throughout the country. We did not sell it on the basis of a partial implementation of the agreement or on implementing sections of the Agreement. Particular emphasis was placed on the setting up of the institutions &ndash; the Executive and the North-South bodies. That will have to be considered.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that people who took a particular interest in this issue and the debates which occurred focused on whether we would see real and meaningful North-South bodies under the institutional arrangements. If we see such meaningful bodies, then people will be happy to change. If we do not, people will have grave difficulties. That is what was put to the people. All of these matters will have to be examined. In reply to the Deputy last week I stated that I would like to think that very soon after the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full, hopefully on the same day, the Government would pass what was agreed and that we would change our Constitution on the basis of what was put to the people.</P>

      <Quest>the current incidence of tuberculosis in cattle compared to 1998; the reason there is an increased incidence in the cattle herd; the research carried out on the level of tuberculosis transmitted through badgers; if he accepts that there is inadequate compensation for reactor cattle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>While considerable progress has been made in reducing the incidence of bovine tuberculosis it has not been possible to eradicate the disease from the national herd. At the same time, it should be borne in mind that 99.5 per cent of cattle are free of TB and the scheme in place facilitates the continued trading of livestock and livestock products to EU and third countries.</P>
      <P>TB levels tend to be cyclical and, unfortunately, the rate of disclosure of reactors was considerably higher in 1998 than preceding years, and this trend continued this year. A detailed review of the precise causes of the high level of the disease is being undertaken and the outcome of this review will be discussed shortly with the farming bodies and veterinary groups in the Animal Health Forum.</P>
      <P>As regards research, a number of projects, including the specialised work of the TB investigation unit, are continuing with the aim of providing new technologies required to eradicate TB. The research is focused in particular on the role of wildlife, as well as establishing the best possible information on the causes of the disease spread.</P>
      <P>The scientific community generally accepts the role of the badger in the spread of bovine tuberculosis and there is a growing body of evidence to support this opinion. Research work on this aspect is currently ongoing in the special areas, namely the east Offaly project which was initiated in 1988 and projects in parts of Donegal, Kilkenny, Cork north and Monaghan which were initiated in 1997, as well as on the development of a vaccine for possible use in wildlife. One of the purposes of removals under the projects is to demonstrate the actual level of infection in a representative sample of the badger population. Of the badgers removed in 1998 from the four new areas, 24 per cent had confirmed tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that there is inadequate compensation for reactor cattle. Grants paid under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes are intended broadly to bridge the gap between the salvage value received by the herdowner from the meat plant and the cost of a replacement commercial animal and that is what is happening generally. My Department monitors the level of grant rates on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>We are back to the old long-playing record regarding the incidence of TB. I thought we would have moved away from that in recent years, but unfortunately according the Minister's figures TB is on the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened for years about the incidence of TB which is carried by badgers. According to the Minister 24 per cent of badgers were found to <Col N="463" /> have the disease. Following all the surveys and scientific research what will the Department do with regard to badgers? Has the Minister accepted that they are one of the greatest conduits for carrying the disease to our national herd? If this is so, then after all the years of research it is time the Minister said what he will do about badgers.</P>
    <P>For many years I have been told that scientifically we would soon get to the stage where we would have a blood sample test to replace the tuberculin test which is not as accurate as it should be. I must confess that this matter has been discussed for an awfully long time. Ten years ago people convinced me that we were almost at the point of having a blood test which would be much more accurate. Will the Minister give an indication as to whether we will ever have a blood test and, if so, when it will be introduced?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister must accept that reactor prices being received by farmers are far below the market value in many cases. Will he give some indication as to when reactor prices will be increased?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that 24 per cent of badgers were confirmed to have tuberculosis. We are looking at ways and means of overcoming the wildlife problem, be it by vaccination or otherwise. That work is ongoing. I can report nothing definite at this time, but wildlife have clearly been identified as part of the problem.</P>
      <P>Regarding blood samples, I will get the information regarding progress as I do not seem to have it with me. It might be a way around the problem. However, I point out to the Deputy that we had only about 44,000 reactors out of a national herd of almost eight million animals. I also wish to point out that while the issue often looks devastating and quite serious, there are only 6,000 herds locked up. These statistics, which are approximate, may be of help to the Deputy in alleviating his concerns.</P>
      <P>Compensation is quite generous, but will always have to be under the level of the commercial value of the stock. If compensation was higher it would have the effect of encouraging people, and there is a certain number of problems and mischief in this area with people seeing more profit in reactors than in quality and reactor free animals. From time to time a number of people are investigated by my Department.</P>

The title of my Department is the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with effect from 27 September last, reflecting its lead role in rural development. Arrangements for the rural proofing of policy proposals are now in place. Arrangements for the Cabinet sub-committee, chaired by the Taoiseach, and the interdepartmental policy committee on rural development have been agreed. I expect to be able to announce very shortly the establishment of the National Rural Development Forum, which will be widely representative. The rural development fund will be in place from next year to support the review and analysis of rural development policy through appropriate research.</P>
      <P>Pilot projects on rural transport are in progress in several areas to examine their effectiveness. In addition, each county development board, from next year, will carry out an audit of local transport needs and services as a priority and will identify with the relevant partners the most appropriate co-ordination and delivery mechanism to ensure effective local transport provision in its area.</P>
      <P>The White Paper is a general policy statement setting out principles and commitments for the future. The commitments in the White Paper will be reflected in the national development plan to be published next Monday. The review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, published last week, reaffirms the Government's commitment to rural development.</P>

How much will the rural development fund amount to? When will it become operational? Will funding in addition to what already exists under a number of heads be provided? Will all funding be gathered together and will it be incremental on a per annum basis?</P>
      <P>Regarding the rural forum, will the Minister indicate the Departments, State agencies, assemblies or regional authorities which will be included? Will local authorities be included?

      <P>The rural development fund will be operational from January next year. In the region of nearly £1 million will be provided for review of policy, feasibility studies and various other things for bodies.

      <P>I asked about rural proofing, an issue which I have championed since being elected to the House. This is a very important part of overall policy direction and one I want to ensure gets top priority. How much resources will be allocated to establish the rural proofing unit? Who will be responsible for establishing this unit, seeing there is a diverse number of Departments involved? Will resources be made available for all the other Departments to employ officers to work in rural proofing across the different areas? As the Minister said, about 14 Departments are involved. How will rural proofing be managed and evaluated to ensure it is effective? How will transport proposals be rural proofed? Will there be a specific proposal for a budget for rural transport projects? This is extremely important as many people feel left out in rural areas because of a lack of transport. Will the Minister consider the idea of using school buses in the period from 9.30 a.m. until 1.30 p.m. or 2.30 p.m., something which has been working extremely well in a pilot project in Westmeath? Will moneys be provided to ensure this is adopted on a more widespread basis in midland counties, particularly in areas which do not have a public transport system? Is that where the money will be allocated, to ensure rural people are treated fairly <i>vis-à-vis</i> their urban counterparts? Is that the idea behind rural proofing? Will the Minister of State ensure, in terms of regional balance in development, that there will be discrimination in funding in favour of rural areas to ensure they get a greater number of industrial projects than they have heretofore?</P>

      <P>With regard to rural proofing, each Department will appoint an officer to ensure that all legislation brought forward will be examined in the context of rural proofing. The interdepartmental committee will also examine legislation for rural proofing, as will the Cabinet sub-committee. There are a number of safety measures, therefore, to ensure rural proofing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy's remarks about rural transport. There are a number of projects in Mayo, Meath, Wicklow, Ballyhoura, Feakle and Westmeath. They use school buses. It appears to <Col N="466" /> be the simplest way of solving the problem because the transport is already there. It is particularly useful because it is local transport. I know a good deal about the project in Feakle. It brings people from remote areas of east Clare into Ennis one day each week. It is used by 37 people and is a great benefit to the area. The maximum fare a passenger pays, who does not have a free travel pass, is £5 return. A hackney for the same journey is £15 return and the hackney driver will not wait for four hours.</P>

      <Quest>the grounds on which his Department appealed the Emerald Meats case to the Supreme Court, taking into account the previous judgment given in the High Court; if damages have been agreed with the company; if so, the extent of these damages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the Emerald Meats case concerns entitlements to licences for the import of beef into the EU under special arrangements almost ten years ago. In 1990 a dispute arose between the meat processors and Emerald Meats, both of whom claimed entitlement to 70 per cent of the licences. My Department decided to allocate the disputed licences to the beef processors who had been allocated the licences when they first became available in 1985 because it believed that, on the basis of the facts then available to it and on its interpretation of the EU regulations, Emerald Meats had acted as an agent of the processors in the case of these licences. The remaining 30 per cent of the licences were allocated to Emerald Meats.</P>
      <P>The High Court ruled against my Department in the judgment it delivered in 1991. The Department appealed it to the Supreme Court on the basis of advice from legal counsel and the Office of the Attorney General that its interpretation of relevant EU regulations, in particular in relation to the agency issue, was open to question. The legal advice was that greater consideration should have been given in the High Court to the fact that the disputed licences had not been transferred to Emerald Meats in accordance with the Community's licensing arrangements and the fact that Emerald Meats had explicitly described itself, in a letter dated 26 January 1989 to my Department, as having acted in 1988 &ldquo;on behalf of&rdquo; the processors. In addition, Emerald Meats failed to comply with EU regulations which oblige an importer to state on customs documentation whether he is acting on his own behalf or on behalf of another person. The appeal to the Supreme Court was heard in December 1995 but the judgment was not delivered until March 1997. My Department unreservedly accepts the ruling of these courts and has fully implemented them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> As far as damages are concerned, the High Court awarded Emerald Meats economic damages of over £400,000 in respect of profits foregone by the company as a result of the Department's decision. This amount was paid in full and without delay by the Department to Emerald Meats in 1992. In its March 1997 decision, the Supreme Court gave leave to Emerald Meats to seek general damages and referred this issue back to the High Court for determination. There is no agreement on the amount of general damages due to Emerald Meats. While it offered to settle the case for £7.5 million in a short half page letter to the Chief State Solicitor's Office in January 1998, the company has not submitted a substantiated statement of claim.</P>
    <P>My Department has been advised both by the Chief State Solicitor's Office and legal counsel that it should only consider offers for settlement based on a substantiated statement of claim. This remains the position. As far as the claim itself is concerned, it has not been substantiated despite the lapse of the two and a half years since the judgment of the Supreme Court in March 1997. This claim also has to be seen in the context where rights to the licences were fully restored to Emerald Meats from 1991 onwards and for which the company was fully compensated in 1992 for the only year in which it was without the licences in dispute, that is, 1990. I am advised by the Office of the Attorney General that the award of interest is not automatic in this situation and any consideration of this could only take place in the context of a substantiated statement of claim and, even then, it would be at the discretion of the judge.</P>
    <P>While the courts found against my Department, all decisions in this case were taken on the basis of legal advice. The costs and damages awarded against my Department were promptly paid to Emerald Meats. The case will continue to be handled in accordance with legal advice and normal legal procedures. I do not wish to prolong this case but, obviously, I can only consider any settlement on the basis of a substantiated statement of claim.</P>
    <P>The decision on the Emerald Meats case was taken almost ten years ago and in the interim there have been major changes in the operations and procedures of the Department. Major initiatives have been taken over the past decade and substantial progress has been made in eliminating the scope for the kind of error which occurred and in ensuring that there is no departure from high standards. The CAP reform of 1992 switched the emphasis of Community support from market supports, notably export refunds and intervention, which is in progressive decline, to direct income support to individual farmers. The Department's handling of this major undertaking has been an acknowledged success. Its performance in the delivery of these income support payments is among the best in Europe.</P>

      <Col N="468" /> Strong financial control and audit procedures have been introduced in recent years. The Department is now certified annually by an independent auditing firm as paying agency of the Commission by complying with the rigorous requirements of the FEOGA accreditation process. The reach and capacity of the Department's IT services have been vastly extended, an upgraded internal audit unit was established in 1994 and an audit committee headed by an external accountant was also established in 1994 to advise management.</P>
    <P>The approach to controlling meat plants has been transformed. There is now greater reliance on unannounced inspections which were first introduced in 1991, special control teams have been set up and chains of command have been clarified. The Department has introduced a system of fair procedures and a customer complaints unit, which deals with weaknesses identified by the Emerald Meats case. A modernisation programme has been under way for some years encompassing major improvements in the financial control environment and service culture of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I and the Department recognise how difficult this matter has been for Emerald Meats. It was not a comfortable time for the Department either. I know that everybody concerned in the Department, as well as the shareholder in Emerald Meats, acted in good faith throughout, notwithstanding the suggestions that have been made to the contrary. The handling of this case has been reviewed internally in the Department and it is clear that there were shortcomings in the Department's management of the scheme concerned, by way of lack of administrative care and failure to afford the company fair procedures in dealing with its applications and representations. This was a unique situation which I do not want to happen again and it would, therefore, be unwise to argue from the particular in this case to the Department in general.</P>
    <P>There have been substantive changes in the Department over the past decade. The nature and type of schemes have changed dramatically and we must position ourselves to deal with the serious issues and challenges facing agriculture over the next decade.</P>
    <P>While the courts found against my Department, all the decisions in this case were taken on the basis of legal advice. The costs and damages awarded against my Department were promptly paid to Emerald Meats. The position in relation to general damages is that Emerald Meats has not substantiated its claim despite the lapse of two and a half years since the Supreme Court judgment. The case has been and will continue to be handled in accordance with legal advice and normal legal procedures.</P>
    <P>Allegations were made against me on the Adjournment last week. I reject them outright and wish to make my position clear. I had no dealings with the meat processor mentioned. I have met him no more than three times in the <Col N="469" /> past decade, once as part of a broader industrial delegation and otherwise in the context of trade organised business receptions. Neither he nor his companies have privileged access to me or my Department. I wish to nail this misconception and reject allegations of collusion.</P>

      <P>This is a serious matter. Serious allegations were made on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme. I worry greatly about one matter. I do not intend to delay Question Time today about interpretations and whether Emerald Meats were agents or otherwise. The problem is that a particular settlement arose after the High Court action and the strong judgment issued by the court. Why was the case appealed to the Supreme Court, given that ruling? To people outside the legal profession, such as myself, the judgment appeared to be so strong there was no reason to go to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>What factors influenced the decision to appeal to the Supreme Court? What were the damages awarded in this case? Had the Department accepted the ruling of the High Court, the damages would probably have been less than £1 million. However, current reports and even the Minister's reply indicate that the matter has not yet been finalised. Figures are being bandied around and it is said that the taxpayer could be exposed to a bill ranging from £11 million to £15 million. The Minister must explain why he appealed to the Supreme Court, despite the information then available to the Department, against the strong ruling from the High Court. That decision is where many of the problems arise.</P>

On the basis of that advice, the Department appealed the case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court heard the case in December 1995 and deliberated on it until March 1997.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to a current matter affecting the Department. The headage and premia appeals unit established within the Department in 1995 affords the opportunity to applicants penalised under the relevant schemes to appeal against the initial decision.</P>
      <P>Although the staff of the appeals unit are officers of my Department, they operate independently of the staff who take the decision in the first place. The extent of that independence can be gauged by reference to the success rate of appeals; 32 per cent of all appeals result in either the complete overturning of the original decision or its partial modification.</P>
      <P>This is a high success rate and reflects the appeals unit's openness to the case made by appellants. It should be noted that the appeals unit, like the offices where the original decisions are taken, is nonetheless bound by the very precise terms of the governing regulations, which it must implement scrupulously in order not to expose this country to censure by the Commission or Court of Auditors, and to protect the Exchequer against penalties.</P>
      <P>I am aware nonetheless that there is a perception of inadequate independence of the unit from the rest of the Department. I have, therefore, asked that the possibility be investigated of establishing the unit on a basis that will overcome this perception.</P>
      <P>If it is possible to establish a fully independent unit without compromising my Department's responsibilities as paying agency for the Commission in respect of all FEOGA funds, I am inclined to believe this is what we should do. I am also open to expanding the unit to cover other schemes in addition to those covered at present. I am having this proposal examined in detail. I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the establishment of an independent unit covering all disputes, difficulties or complaints against the Department in relation to any of the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to correct any impression that might be given by the question that it is errors by the Department that generally give rise to complaints from farmers. While errors do occur, as they do in any organisation, they number a very small <Col N="472" /> percentage of the applications processed. The vast bulk of appeals relate to penalties applied by the Department under law on foot of failure by applicants to comply fully with the terms of the relevant schemes.</P>

While a court case has not been taken in regard to complaints in this area, if the Department officials had not been so vicious in going to court because they felt that they were right, we may not have the problems that have arisen in respect of the case that was the subject of the previous question, but that is another issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulatory framework arising from the Agenda 2000 agreement allows for greater flexibility in the operation of the milk quota regime. I have decided to take the opportunity to make significant changes in the system that operates in Ireland in order to ensure that active committed milk producers have greater access to quota over the coming years. It is essential that the new system will bring a greater degree of certainty to these producers so that the dairy industry will be in a position to meet the competitive challenges that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve this, I have decided that the transfer of quota based on the rigid link between quota and land will be replaced by a system that allows for the sale of quota in a structured manner and in line with priority categories which will be set. This will be done in a fair and balanced way in order to encourage the best possible development of the industry while recognising the interests of all the parties involved. I hope this will facilitate a more orderly arrangement for the distribution of quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the introduction of changes to the manner in which quotas can be transferred is a complex process and I have been advised these changes should be implemented by primary legislation. Every Member will get an opportunity during the passage of that legislation to table <Col N="474" /> amendments and, if they are worthwhile, I will accept them because the issue of land and quota is dear to Irish people. I want to make sure this is done in a proper, fair and equitable way. This legislation will address the question of family transfers and other exceptional circumstances and will seek to provide adequate protection for all milk producers. It is intended that the arrangements for dealing with existing and expiring leases will also be contained in that primary legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his endeavours in this regard. As a principle, any changes that favour active producers is something to which I am sure we would all subscribe, but the Minister must also be aware that there is an inextricable link between leasing arrangements for quota and the farm retirement scheme. While we are all anxious to facilitate those who are active producers, what plans has the Minister to provide for those who are in the farm retirement scheme, who will see the value of their asset, their milk quotas, diminish significantly in a relatively short period? Will he take steps to ensure proper synchronisation between the new leasing arrangement and the new farm retirement scheme that will be introduced and that those who will be most severely affected by the new arrangements will be adequately compensated? When is it anticipated the relevant legislation will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust of the change is to make it easier for active milk producers, particularly young farmers, to get access to milk. Since the courses were introduced, we know how difficult it is for committed farmers to get access to milk. Officials from the Department as well as an officer from the Office of the Attorney General intended to go to Brussels this week to meet the legal services of the Commission to ensure we have a sound legal basis for the legislation, but Brussels postponed the meeting until next week. It is envisaged we will have the legislation through the House in time for 1 April, which is the new milk quota year.</P>
      <P>I want to ensure a smooth changeover so that inter-family arrangements are not disrupted. Some farmers have a substantial amount of their milk on lease. If they have 70,000 gallons from approximately 20 cows, 50,000 gallons could be their own and 20,000 could be leased. That lease will not be terminated abruptly and the milk farmer will not have to sell part of his herd. We want to do it smoothly and fairly and to take into account people's different circumstances. At the same time, we want the future of the dairy industry in the hands of committed active milk producers who milk their cows every morning and evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said about people who are committed to dairy production. However, there is another side to this <Col N="475" /> equation. Sufficient thought has not been given to the financial implications for people who have entered long-term arrangements through farm retirement schemes and who have leased their quotas. The Minister should factor in satisfactory compensatory arrangements for these people before he publishes legislation because the Department's track record on milk quotas is not good, regardless of what Minister was in office. One has only to remember the milk rights case, the Duff case and the mulder quota.</P>

      <P>In so far as the scheme of early retirement from farming is concerned, full compensation, with 100 per cent funding by the EU, will be payable for the reduction in 1999 pensions to participants who joined the scheme prior to 1998. Approval of the EU Commission is necessary before compensation will be paid. It is hoped the Commission will give the necessary approval by the end of November. Once such a decision is received, payment will issue as soon as possible. Two further tranches of compensation at reduced levels will be paid.</P>

      <P>This is an important structural scheme from a socio-economic viewpoint. More than one quarter of our farmers are over 65 years of age. Why has it taken so long to pay money to farmers who lost out as a result of the introduction of the euro? Why did it take 11 months for this decision to be made when the Council of Ministers approved it seven or eight months ago? Are we the poodles of Europe? Why can other countries implement measures approved at Council of Ministers level? Are we the whipping boys of Europe? How many farmers have been affected by the introduction of the euro? Have they lost up to £45 per month, which is £11 or £12 per week? Has it had any impact on the numbers of farmers who want to participate in the farm retirement scheme? I cannot understand why it has taken so long for EU money to reach the pockets of farmers.</P>

      <P>The farm retirement pension has been successful in Ireland. We have taken up this scheme more than any other member state. I have had negotiations with Commissioner Fischler and the Council of Ministers to try to improve this scheme. However, there are still niggling problems, such as getting additional land. This matter was approved at the Council of Agriculture Ministers and then sent to the services of the Commission where I thought it would be dealt with fairly quickly. We often complain that our Civil Service takes a long time to do anything, but bureaucracy in Europe is excruciatingly slow.</P>
      <P>The payment will be backdated to 1 January but that is of cold comfort to people who are on a retirement pension. I want it paid as quickly as possible. The information available to me is that the Commission will make a decision before the end of the month and then the payment will be made straight away. At least it will be a nice Christmas box for people this year.</P>

      <P>The matter is not as simple as the Minister outlined. Is it true that until last June the Minister and the Department thought the Exchequer would have to fund it and that he realised only then that Brussels might do it and that is why it has taken so long? Pensioners are angry because five or six months have been wasted. Can the Minister assure the House that every pensioner will get their back payment by Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They will get their back payments by Christmas. I would have preferred if this matter had been sorted out long ago. This is a new scheme which has been successful. Up to 10,000 farmers are availing of it and it will cost approximately £75 million per annum. It is the first retirement scheme to work in Ireland because it applies to inter-family transfers. We want the management of farms transferred to younger people and we want to keep the scheme in operation. I would be pleased if improvements to the scheme were more attractive under Agenda 2000 and if more young people managed farms. That is how we want to drive the agriculture and food industries in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 74 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals for cuts in export refunds before the EU Council of Ministers at present. I understand that the Commission intends to present a report to the Council in the near future on the implications for export refunds of the obligations imposed by the GATT Uruguay Round Agreement of the EU budget constraints.</P>
      <P>The World Trade Organisation's ministerial conference in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999 aims to take the decisions necessary to launch a new round of trade negotiations, including agriculture. I expect that a new WTO round, including a new agreement on agriculture, will be launched and that the negotiations will take a number of years to complete. Ireland will participate in the Seattle conference and in the subsequent negotiations as a member of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The EU has been preparing its overall position for the Seattle conference for some time and I have been actively involved in that process. The position adopted by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers on 27 September 1999 and confirmed by the General Affairs Council provides that: the negotiations on agriculture will be based on the mandate provided in Article 20 of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture which conditions the long-term objectives of trade liberalisation by other concerns, notably the experience and effects of implementing the commitments agreed in 1994, non-trade concerns, special and differential treatment of developing countries and the objective to establish a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system; the EU position will be based on the full Agenda 2000 package decided by the European Council in Berlin in March 1999; the EU will be prepared to negotiate reductions in support provided the concept of the &ldquo;blue and green&rdquo; boxes will continue; similar instruments to the peace clause and the special safeguard clause will be needed in the future; the EU will take forward the multifunctional role of agriculture, food safety, food quality and animal welfare; and the EU will actively promote special and differential treatment for developing countries, especially for the least developed countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to keep up with changes in procedure. I will complete my prepared reply and I thank you, Sir, for drawing this matter to my attention.</P>
      <P>While the EU position stresses the fundamental importance of safeguarding the future of the European model of agriculture, it also recognises that the interests of developing countries need to be protected and, in particular, that the new round should provide benefits to developing countries and assist the integration of those countries, particularly the least developed countries, into the international trade system.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparations at EU level for the opening of the WTO negotiations and in addition to the normal multinational meetings, consultations have taken place at ministerial and official level between Ireland and other EU member states. The agricultural attaché in Geneva, who is seconded from my Department, is participating fully in the preparations for the Seattle conference which are taking place in Geneva and is in continual contact there with representatives of both EU and non-EU members of the WTO. This process of consultation with other countries will continue and intensify when the new round of trade negotiations has commenced. The EU Council of Agriculture Ministers will, of course, maintain an active role in the forthcoming negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the European Union stand on export refunds? These must be paid on the basis of agreed procedure within the EU and it is important for Ireland that we know, not alone where the Minister stands but what the EU stance on this matter will be. What input will the Minister have into this very important issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton has hit the nail on the head. The single most important matter for Ireland in these negotiations is to protect export refunds. The second consideration, which is almost equally important, is the protection of direct payments. We will be insisting on the blue box to protect any reductions in direct payments, as we did the last time. We will do the same with regard to export refunds. At the last meeting of the Council of Ministers in September we agreed that the multifunctional role of agriculture in the EU would form the thrust of our negotiating position. We want to insist on export refunds being maintained because we have very large exports outside the EU and we want to protect them. Those are the two critical issues. These are the two things which the Cairns Group and the other countries involved in the WTO wish to reduce and emasculate. The negotiations will be quite tough and will continue until 2003. As a state <Col N="480" /> more dependent on exports than any other member state, we want to make sure our position is protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is acutely aware of the problems in the sheepmeat industry. This matter will be of great concern at the forthcoming WTO negotiations. What steps will the Minister take to ensure there is no increase in the importation of lamb from New Zealand and other non-EU countries? Does the Minister agree that these imports have contributed significantly to the problems which sheep farmers are experiencing? The importation of 247,000 tonnes of sheepmeat contributes to making the EU 103 per cent self-sufficient in sheepmeat. What is the cost in EU subsidisation of this level of imports and what impact has it had on the income of Irish sheep farmers? Does the Minister agree that any further increase in sheepmeat imports would signal the demise of Irish sheep farming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports into the European Union are a major problem for Europe and for Ireland. The agricultural sector has two particularly difficult problems at present, the sheepmeat and pigmeat sectors. In both cases, there is a substantial level of imports into the EU and Ireland. For example, approximately 35,000 tonnes of pigmeat are imported into Ireland while our domestic requirement is only 135,000. A quarter of our annual requirements is being imported. Every effort will be made to ensure that there is no disruption of the European market, but the present New Zealand quota is 206,000 and that is an enormous amount of sheepmeat. Quite a substantial amount of this comes in chilled form and is very competitive while previously it was imported in frozen form.</P>
      <P>We have the additional difficulty of the explosion in the number of sheep. A few years ago we had between three million and four million sheep whereas we have eight million now. The problem is similar in the UK. We used to export live sheep to Spain and Portugal but those countries are now exporters themselves. For a relatively small economy such as Ireland the WTO round of negotiations will be critically important. Any gains or copper-fastening of the position of the CAP reform will be severely tested. We will have to make every effort to ensure that the industry &ndash; farmers and processors &ndash; have a secure future in the first decade of the next millennium.</P>

      <P>I am pleased my constituency colleague, Deputy Sheehan, has brought these important matters to the attention of the House because, while the blue box is extremely important to protect indirect payments, there is a concern about the green box and the amber box. While we go to a great deal of trouble to ensure Irish consumers of poultry products, for example, are protected from antibiotics and various residues, there is a large number of poultry coming into Ireland and we do not know what has gone into the process. We want to ensure in the WTO round that the phytosanitary aspects of it are fully taken into account. If our producers and industry adhere to certain standards, importers would have to adhere to the same standards. It is not good enough that some countries use BST to boost milk production which gives them an economic advantage. We do not allow that in Ireland. We want a level playing pitch and I am glad my colleague brought this matter to the attention of the House.</P>

In view of the tardiness of the Government in advancing its own legislation, an example being the Private Members' Bill referred to by Deputy Jim Higgins, which deals with the security industry, will the Whips discuss the possibility, as has been the case in previous administrations, of Second Stage of those Bills being accepted and their being referred to relevant committee? The Government, if it has amendments to make, would be in a position to make them then. We are simply not doing our job as a Legislature at present.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on all sides have made a wide range of contributions to the debate. When the Taoiseach was leader of the Opposition he gave the people a solemn undertaking that there would be a referendum on PfP and he reneged upon that in Government. Fine Gael, as has been outlined by Deputy Mitchell on numerous occasions, has been consistent in its position on PfP. We believe in it and think that it is an important element of Ireland's progression on the European stage. It does not involve becoming a member of NATO. Ireland will not be forced into war games or send young soldiers to fight in wars all over the world. PfP will provide a long list of opportunities for Ireland and it can decide on those which it wishes to take up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity for young men and women to participate in the Army should be grasped because it delivers challenge. Young people will not stay in jobs which are mundane and where they are likely to go to seed because a challenge is not offered. When one speaks to soldiers who have participated in peacekeeping operations one formulates an understanding of their career pros<Col N="496" /> pects and their desire to meet other military personnel and garner knowledge about various equipment and technology. While the Army has done a first class job, of which all of us are proud, young people do not want to be on standby to drive refuse trucks or deliver water supplies, which is necessary on occasion.</P>
    <P>Only 12 soldiers remain in the Army out of a class of 43 which joined in 1980 because of a lack of career prospects; a lack of challenge; and the improvement in the economy. One cannot expect bright, intelligent young people who display initiative and want to be involved in Ireland's participation in the military landscape to stay in what many of them perceive to be a dead end job with no career prospects. That should not be so and we should not be ashamed of involvement in the five areas put forward by the Government &ndash; co-operation in peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection of the environment; and co-operation in marine matters. These are important issues and Ireland can decide on the issues in which it wants to participate. It is important as we move forward.</P>
    <P>The Swiss have decided to join PfP without fear. Switzerland has a structured society and it holds referenda on various issues several times a year. Ireland should get on with it. I regret very much that the Taoiseach did not honour his word when he was leader of the Opposition. I recently saw him togged out in camouflage gear in Kosovo. I have received complaints from Army personnel that similar gear has not yet been made available to the Army, which requires it more than the Taoiseach, or perhaps not, depending on the fall out from various political issues. He should ensure that this gear is provided to the Army as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that having debated this matter for a number of weeks Members of the Government parties have decided to excuse themselves from this debate. There is silence on the opposite side of the House as a result of the gigantic U-turn in policy by the Fianna Fáil Party. As director of elections for Fine Gael in the Dublin South-Central by-election, I noted that the level of cynicism was palpable with regard to politicians who people perceived as not keeping their word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A manifesto is the most important document that any party can present to the people. It sets out clearly what a party wants to do in Government and it is, therefore, disgraceful that Fianna Fáil, which made an explicit commitment to a referendum on PfP, has done a complete U-turn. This issue has increased cynicism about politics over the past month. Fianna Fail made an appalling U-turn as it gave one commitment in Opposition and another in Government. I do not agree with the Green Party's stance on PfP but it is at least consistent, as is Fine Gael's. These are the only two parties in the House which have consist<Col N="497" /> ently maintained their position on Ireland's participation in PfP.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is proud of its record of consistency on this issue. I congratulate our spokesperson, Deputy Mitchell, not just for his contribution on this motion but for the work he had done on this issue over the past two years. A number of Deputies said that the debate has only been thrust upon us in recent times. That is absolute nonsense and some members of the media have not paid attention to the assiduous work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy when my party was in Government with the Labour Party and Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>It is typically hypocritical that when we come to making a decision on such a matter, we claim that we have not had a debate. There has been debate and it is time to make a decision. Furthermore, it is time that people were consistent regarding the position they presented to the people at the last general election. The thumbprints of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, are all over the White Paper. It states:</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to explore further the benefits that might derive from participation in Partnership for Peace and to determine the contribution that Ireland might make to that participation. A decision on participation in PfP will only be taken by the Government in light of consultations, including with the relevant Committees of the Oireachtas, and such a decision will be subject to a motion and the terms and scope of any participation by Ireland being approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what has happened. I understand the Committee on Foreign Affairs has discussed this matter on nine separate occasions in the past 18 months. The Government has presented its view and it is right in suggesting that a referendum is not required. The Government has presented, by way of substantive motion, Ireland's entry to PfP. That was set out three years ago when the White Paper was published by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The White Paper was quite clear. That is the reason I cannot understand why some parties who were involved in the publication of this document have done a U-turn by asking for a plebiscite. A plebiscite has no standing in Irish law. Article 29 of the Constitution clearly states the obligations we are entering into in relation to international affairs. That article specifically puts responsibility on this House to pass any binding contract we make with other international organisations. That is precisely what the Government is doing. My party and I support that view.</P>
    <P>It was a disgrace that in the last general election and in the run up to it in this House the then Leader of the Opposition, the current Taoiseach, used the issue so cynically. It is interesting to reflect that a later section in the White Paper, <Col N="498" /> which outlines the new role PfP would have in international relations, states: &ldquo;However, the overall objectives of PfP are consistent with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security and participation in the partnership could have several important advantages.&rdquo;  This document which was debated substantively in the House some years ago has been proven to be correct and the procedures followed were correct. If we are to rule ourselves as a completely irrelevant Legislature, we would run to the country every time an issue such as this had to be faced. There is absolutely no difficulty in maintaining our current position of neutrality and our membership with PfP. Furthermore, the Amsterdam Treaty which was accepted by the people in 1998 clearly outlines the Petersberg Tasks which are consistent with Ireland's membership and our participation in PfP. That consistent line has been maintained throughout. The overriding endorsement which the Irish people gave this House when we signed the Amsterdam Treaty was that we were prepared to accept future involvements in terms of the Petersberg Tasks involving rescue and peacekeeping missions, crisis management and other areas.</P>
    <P>I remind the House of the appalling speech by the then Leader of the Opposition, the current Taoiseach, some years ago when he said: &ldquo;We would regard any attempt to push Partnership for Peace or participation in Western European Union tasks by resolution through this House without reference to the people who, under our Constitution, have the right in final appeal to decide on all questions of national policy as a serious breach of faith as fundamentally undemocratic.&rdquo;  Those were the words of the Taoiseach some years ago when his mind was put to this task. It is a disgrace that he comes into the House and admits readily this gigantic U-turn is not important and that the commitment he gave to the people some years ago does not matter. It does matter. In his correspondence with the Leader of his party, I hope the Minister will put it to him that he and his party are increasing cynicism in politics by saying one thing in opposition and another in Government. This is something which the Minister and his party are particularly good at. The party cannot get out of that conundrum which it has put itself into.</P>
    <P>My party has consistently supported Ireland's membership of PfP. We have said that for the past number of years. Our influence in respect of the White Paper can be seen as one reads through that document. We have taken that position because Ireland's membership of PfP involves no mutual defence mechanism whatsoever, which would be unconstitutional, because there are clear commitments in the Constitution in respect of going down that avenue. There is no difficulty with our country joining with every other country in central and western Europe. As Deputy Kenny pointed out, substantive benefits can accrue to our Army and other agencies involved with PfP. <Col N="499" /> We have much to give Partnership for Peace and we have much to learn.</P>
    <P>Three years ago I was a member of a delegation which visited Sarajevo to see the SFOR troops on the ground. The visit was paid for by the American Embassy in Dublin. I was joined by the Green Party and the Labour Party. It is interesting to note that Fianna Fáil decided not to send anybody because it was so implacably opposed to Partnership for Peace. I saw at first hand what an international brigade such as that can do in an area of crisis management. Ireland is very good at pointing the finger at other international organisations and other countries in relation to crisis management and resolving ethnic and nationalistic problems in the former Yugoslavia. We are very good at pointing in the direction of the United States, the United Kingdom and France in regard to foreign policy.</P>
    <P>When it was decided to send military police to Sarajevo three years ago, following acceptance of a motion in this House, there was no demand from any party for a referendum on the issue because those people were taking their place with other countries in helping to bring peace and security to Bosnia following the appalling ethnic wars in the Baltic region during the past ten years or so. No referendum was promised on that occasion. In arguing for a referendum today we are pandering to the worst forms of nationalism.</P>
    <P>Much of our foreign affairs policy for the past 50 years has focused exclusively on how we can take a position against the United Kingdom. It is time this country grew up, took its international obligations seriously and was prepared to commit to these theatres where there is a need for international mobilisation of defence forces to bring about peace and security to help the whole issue of crisis management, ostensibly the Petersberg Tasks. I passionately believe that if Ireland is to play a further role in the European Union we should take these obligations seriously. We should not pander to any kind of little Ireland or nationalism, something which is evident from the contributions to this debate. I make no apology for saying I am pro-American. I support what the US has done in many parts of the world. In many cases it was the only country that was prepared to put its dollar where its mouth was. It was only after the failure of the European Union to intervene in Bosnia and when many of its member states decided to debate the matter that the United States decided to take part in the SFOR and KFOR initiatives. While I support the motion, it is a gigantic exercise in Fianna Fáil cynicism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>When the record of the debate on Partnership for Peace in this House is read by historians there will be cynicism and laughter. Given the stances adopted previously by various parties, they will point to certain individuals and ask, &ldquo;What were they at? Why did they act in <Col N="500" /> that way and what was the outcome?&rdquo;  When the attitude of Fianna Fáil in particular is reviewed there will be tremendous cynicism.</P>
      <P>In opposition the Taoiseach spoke strongly about the dangers and said there should be a referendum on whether Ireland should join. In government he has done a complete U-turn. What is the reason for this? There are many possible answers. In opposition did he adopt the stance that he took purely to oppose the then Government? When one looks at the approach adopted by Fianna Fáil to many issues one can only come to the conclusion that that is the case. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, adopted the attitude that he had to oppose Deputy Owen no matter what she did. It appears she was responsible for all the bank robberies that occurred at that time. Bank robberies are occurring daily but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform just wrings his hands and says that he has no role to play in the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>This leads to cynicism among the public. My famous constituency colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, summed it up well. When asked why Fianna Fáil adopts a different attitude in government her response was, &ldquo;That was then, this is now&rdquo;; in other words, the position changes when one moves from one side of the House to the other. If that is its attitude it is a sorry state of affairs.</P>
      <P>Another possible reason Fianna Fáil acted in the way it did is that it had not looked closely enough at what was involved in PfP and it decided to run with the approach recommended by the spin doctors as it would make good reading. If that is the case it has to be severely criticised.</P>
      <P>The sad part is that the Taoiseach did not set out clearly the reasons for the change in attitude or apologise to the people for getting it wrong. In such circumstances politicians would do a great deal to enhance their reputation if they came out and said, &ldquo;I was wrong, I made a mistake for which I apologise&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche indicated some time ago that he was opposed to PfP and that he would call for a referendum. He also insinuated that he would vote against the Government &ndash; perhaps the whip was cracked or he realised his future within the party did not look good &ndash; but somewhere along the way he got the wobblies. When his Independent constituency colleague, Deputy Fox, indicated that she would definitely vote against the Government he changed his position once again and in a watered down version has called for a referendum on neutrality. I do not know from where he is coming but his approach can only be described as muddled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party is practising what Fianna Fáil did in opposition. In government with Fine Gael it was prepared to support Ireland's membership of PfP and knew that a referendum would not be required, as indicated by some of its contributors to this debate. Despite this it is saying <Col N="501" /> the people should be given an opportunity to vote on the issue. Most of the Labour Party Members seem to think that because Fianna Fáil promised to hold a referendum it should be held, end of story. Is that a good reason to hold a referendum or a logical position from which to come? </P>
    <P>A senior member of the Labour Party said that if we are to bring the people with us there must be a referendum. How does this make sense? Despite the fact that the electorate are well informed and there are many current affairs programmes on radio and television there is tremendous ignorance about what PfP is all about. Shortly after the local elections in June I was informed by a soldier that he had conducted a survey of the local election candidates who knocked on his door, on where they stood on PfP. Only one knew what it was all about. Some had the guts and the gumption to say that they knew nothing about it while two or three who should have known better and see themselves filling prominent positions in later life thought it had something to do with the Northern Ireland peace process about which they went on to speak. If this is an indication of where the public stands on PfP it is a sad state of affairs, although it may be said that it was not a fair sample. One would imagine however that many local election candidates would be fairly tuned in.</P>
    <P>On taking office the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, said that the first thing he would do was develop understanding and informed discussion of PfP. This has not happened. While there are many debates in this House and the matter has been dealt with in talk shows on radio and television, the public has not been informed with the result that it is not aware of what is involved. The participants in these talk shows tend to adopt polarised positions and shout down anyone who holds a different position. We owe it to the public to ensure that such programmes are balanced. The Green Party speakers were at least consistent in their approach to Partnership for Peace. They vigorously oppose it, but then the Green Party seems to oppose almost everything that is internationally based. It opposes most things that happen here with great gusto and it is a pity its members cannot be more constructive. The bouquet, however, must go to Deputy Ó Caoláin, the Sinn Féin representative in this House, who is opposed to any kind of military alliance or partnership. He is opposed to anything to do with &ldquo;military&rdquo;. That is hard to take from someone who is a member of Sinn Féin when we note the former allegiances and alliances of Sinn Féin and when we see what is happening in relation to discussions on demilitarisation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We need to carefully examine PfP, and many speakers did that in their contributions. It is a new organisation, only six years in operation. It involves 43 countries, 24 of which are non-members of NATO. It includes the neutral countries, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. Many of those countries joined Partnership for <Col N="502" /> Peace with little discussion at local level. Switzerland is a case in point and the Minister made clear in his contribution that Switzerland tends to have a referendum on most matters. It could have several referenda in one year on various issues concerning its external affairs but it did not have a referendum on PfP and joined without any major debate.</P>
    <P>What are we to do? Is our neutrality to be compromised? Will we find ourselves in difficulty in relation to this? I do not think so. We are not joining a particular treaty. We are not entering into defence commitments. We are not entering into a military alliance. We are simply joining PfP with an<i> à la carte </i>menu in that we can participate in some areas and withdraw from others. Membership is mainly about peacekeeping and international co-operation on various issues, and Ireland has a particular role to play in that regard.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played a tremendous role in peacekeeping across the world. Thousands of our soldiers have been involved in missions in many countries, and let us not forget the gardaí. More recently, a small but important number of gardaí worked side by side with soldiers in various countries on peacekeeping missions. A total of 76 Irish soldiers have died abroad on peacekeeping missions. They gave their lives in the cause of peacekeeping. The people of Ireland are proud of the job our soldiers have done in peacekeeping. They are proud of the fact that they helped to keep the peace in many countries of the world. When we saw the television pictures of Kosovo, Rwanda and East Timor, many people wanted to know if we could do something. They wanted to know why the UN or EU countries could not do something. Our involvement in PfP will strengthen the alliances of many countries and strengthen the will to avail of peacekeepers and international co-operation to quell the terrible atrocities which have occurred in some countries. Our soldiers have much to gain from Ireland's membership of PfP. They have attained particular skills in terms of peacekeeping and service abroad but they can learn much more and our membership of PfP will help in that regard. I ask the House to support the motion.</P>

      <P>In concluding the debate on the motion, I thank all the contributors for and against the proposition. It was a wide-ranging debate. People were given as much time as they wanted, as is appropriate, and the subject has been advanced by the quality of the contributions from all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to review some of the fundamental issues involved in Partnership for Peace and to respond to some of the specific points raised during the course of the debate. The first point relates to the quality of the public debate on PfP which the previous speaker suggested was not great in the sense that, inevitably, there is always a brouhaha on radio and television programmes and the main point is missed. I would not altogether disagree with that because it is difficult to <Col N="503" /> inform both the listener and the viewer if there is an argy-bargy between the antagonists and the protagonists on a particular programme. I understand that. It is difficult to get the specific message across in the context of what the viewer beholds or a listener hears at a particular time and if the debate is &ldquo;hot&rdquo;, the subject and the specific points related to the subject are inclined to fall by the wayside.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions during our debate that the public debate has been unsatisfactory or incomplete. I do not necessarily accept that view. I accept some criticism in relation to it. PfP has been in existence for almost six years. When I became Minister for Foreign Affairs I sought to develop an understanding of the issues involved and to stimulate and inform subsequent public debate.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Government's motion, I set out at some length the efforts which I and my colleagues in Government have made to encourage a healthy and open debate. The record of this House over the past year is testament to our efforts. Since October 1997 there have been over 40 parliamentary questions related to Partnership for Peace, Dáil debates were devoted to the issue in January and May 1999, there has been an Adjournment debate, the Foreign Affairs committee has considered the issue on a number of occasions and a detailed explanatory guide was issued at my direction in May of this year, along with a summary. The guide, which was distributed to all Deputies, is available free to members of the public and is also available on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Both the Taoiseach and I contributed newspaper articles and have been interviewed a number of times on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the approach we are taking to PfP, as set out in the excellent Presentation Document which I produced under my own direction and which is clear and concise for those who address it&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;is fully in keeping with our values and peacekeeping traditions.</P>
      <P>Partnership for Peace has no implications for neutrality. I have followed the public debate very carefully and nothing in it has caused me to change this view. I can understand the anxiety which many people have expressed about implications for our neutrality. I have sought at every opportunity to allay these fears and to demonstrate that they are groundless. The reality is set out in our Presentation Document, which states plainly that &ldquo;Ireland's decision to participate in PfP is fully in accordance with our policy of military neutrality which has always been pursued in tandem with full and active support for collective security, based on international law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The period of public debate has reinforced my conviction that we can pursue an approach within PfP and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, EAPC, which is fully in accordance with our fundamental values. In this context, attention has focused, in particular, on our contribution to peacekeeping. The pride which we can take in our UN peacekeeping record is fully justified. It represents common ground in this debate that we should maintain and, where possible, strengthen this peacekeeping role. Quite properly, tributes have been paid to the Garda and the Defence Forces, who have brought immense pride to the good name of Ireland in their peacekeeping roles abroad.</P>
      <P>A positive result of the public debate on PfP is that the changing nature of peacekeeping has come to be generally recognised. We are willing to face the challenges which the new style of peacekeeping presents. Our recent decisions to contribute to KFOR in Kosovo and INTERFET in East Timor demonstrate this willingness clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that PfP would represent a move away from our support for the United Nations or a breach of our tradition of peacekeeping. This is not an either-or issue. The role of regional organisations in peacekeeping is recognised and accepted by the United Nations. No one state or institution can, by itself, deal with the multi-faceted crises which we have seen in recent years. These crises have complex humani<Col N="505" /> tarian, political and security dimensions. I have set out clearly our interest in PfP's work on humanitarian aspects of peacekeeping, to give one example of an area of interest to Ireland.</P>
    <P>New models of co-operation at the regional level have been endorsed by the United Nations and by the OSCE. This House has wholeheartedly approved our participation in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. These missions are part of the new pattern of peacekeeping. In the case of Bosnia and Kosovo, the United Nations has authorised NATO to lead these forces. I reject any suggestion that our contribution to these missions is in breach of our finest traditions of peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>This motion offers us an opportunity to show confidence in our future contributions to peace and stability in Europe. Rather than express a clear choice for the future, some have sought to look back. I have made a frank admission that we have changed our minds on this issue. I hoped that we would have similar frankness and clarity on all sides.</P>
    <P>There are those who were clearly in favour of PfP when they were part of the Government which issued the 1996 White Paper on Foreign Policy. Now they cannot bring themselves to support this straightforward motion. They prefer to call for a referendum. In Government, they were quite clear &ndash; and the words of the former Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, are on the record of this House &ndash; that there was no need or basis for a referendum on this issue. Before judging others on the grounds of consistency, perhaps they should examine their own record and tell the people what has changed, in their view, to support their change of position.</P>
    <P>I should also like to respond to remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition during the course of the debate, when he suggested that the broad approach that the Government is taking in the ongoing security debate in Europe is not consistent with our earlier position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Bruton, that the approach we have been following, both before and after the European Council in Cologne, is fully consistent with the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, as negotiated by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised by a suggestion from the Leader of the Labour Party that membership of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council would pose difficulties. The EAPC is a welcome development which provides a voluntary political consultation framework for PfP countries. It responds to the wishes of non-members of NATO for such a forum. It has no implications for our neutrality. In line with the basic approach of PfP, the EAPC is based on a self-differentiating approach. I remind Deputy Quinn that the con<Col N="506" /> cept of the EAPC was elaborated and came into being during the period in office of the previous Government, of which he was a member.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed over the question of the appointment of an ambassador to NATO for the purposes of representation at the periodic ambassadorial meetings of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. This does not change the approach we are taking to PfP and it will not be construed as a signal that we intend to join NATO.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In this regard, we will be in line with the practice of other neutral PfP nations. All 24 of the non-NATO PfP countries have appointed, or are in the process of appointing, ambassadors for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Our excellent Presentation Document sets out clearly Ireland's approach to PfP. In this debate, there are those who complain that it is too restricted. Others complain that it is more detailed on peacekeeping than the Swedish and Finnish documents, which were drawn up when PfP was in its infancy, more than five years ago. Our Presentation Document is fully in accord with the approach to PfP which I have consistently set out over the past year.</P>
      <P>There have been suggestions that participation in PfP would impose enormous costs on the tax payer and that these costs would even result in cut-backs in social expenditure. These suggestions are simply groundless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>They are attempts to frighten people and are quite wrong and irresponsible.

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Beyond these administrative and staffing costs, there is not a mandatory contribution to PfP. Instead PfP operates on the principle that each country funds the cost of its own participation in PfP activities. This means that our costs will be proportionate to the nature and scope of our participation. As these activities will relate mainly to peacekeeping, the costs will be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence, in the first instance. Expenditure decisions of this kind will remain entirely a sovereign choice for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was made by Deputy O'Kennedy in regard to the commitments of PfP nations in respect of disarmament and arms control. In subscribing to the PfP's framework document, each PfP participant reaffirms its commitments to the <Col N="507" /> fulfilment of its obligations in the field of disarmament and arms control. The EAPC's work on global humanitarian mine action and small arms transfers is intended to complement, and add value to other international and national efforts aimed at these terrible scourges to humanity.</P>

Participation in PfP will not entail acceptance of nuclear deterrence; that arises only for NATO members and there are no <Col N="508" /> such obligations in PfP.

      <P>I reaffirm a point I made in introducing this motion and which was mentioned by a number of Members. It is a point on which there is no room for confusion. Participation in PfP will not cut across the constitutional prerogatives of the Dáil in relation to our Defence Forces, nor will it change the current situation, whereby a UN mandate and Dáil approval are required for Irish participation in peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations.</P>
      <P>In concluding this debate, I would stress that joining PfP, which is engaged in co-operation for peacekeeping, is entirely consistent with our basic long-standing approach to international security. It is also fully complementary to the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management activities, as set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of digital television which has tended to be overlooked is its potential for local television. The technology involved in digital television gives us access to a vast number of channels, some of which can be used for television programmes produced regionally and targeted at a local audience. This should mean people will no longer feel their areas or counties are not being mentioned. I hope the understandable impression, which is alive in many parts, that television is lopsided in favour of Dublin will disappear. The significance of establishing TG4 reiterates clearly the Government's commitment to the Irish language, not as some cultural curiosity but as a vibrant vehicle of communication.</P>
      <P>While technology often dazzles and startles us, it does more. It helps us to overcome the insurmountable. We must make sure the technology of digital television is used for the greatest good. In the future there will not be just television viewers sitting passively in front of the screen, there will be television users. Television will inform as well as entertain us. For example, RTE has already put in place plans for a dedicated news channel.</P>
      <P>The national broadcaster faces huge competition but it knows the best way to fight this competition is by providing a quality service, which is what the people want. This is the essence of public service broadcasting. It is not answerable to anonymous shareholders. It is not simply in pursuit of the biggest and quickest profit regardless of the product quality. It is answerable at the end of the day to the Irish people. It is this commitment to the people of Ireland that will sustain it successfully against all competition.</P>
      <P>The digital age in television opens up a whole new world for us. It presents many opportunities but also many challenges. It is uncharted waters but this should not make us complacent. The Broadcasting Bill puts in place mechanisms to ensure we face this new age with confidence. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this important legislation.</P>

      <P>On a positive note, I express my gratitude to all those in broadcasting, whether television or radio, for the magic they are able to produce day after day.

        <b>:</b> Local radio can produce shows with very little back-up. If I were to be critical of RTE, it would be that the list of credits following programmes seems to go on forever naming producers, lighting technicians, studio operators, sound technicians and floor personnel. Local radio people seem to be able to do the research, make the telephone calls between the advertisements and keep the show going. In fairness to all those involved in the production of these shows, it is a marvellous tribute to their skills that day after day they go in to make new programmes. There is no routine. &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; must have topics to discuss every morning and, as I try to wake up and listen to what is going on, I find others are alert, giving their views and switching from one topic to the next. Instead of criticising what they have done and the mistakes they have made, I will give them blanket praise. I appreciate what they are trying to do and that it is not easy.</P>
      <P>The Bill will open the floodgates to a certain extent. We will be able to access many new stations if DTT comes into play. When I saw the letters &ldquo;DTT&rdquo; first, it reminded me of my youth when DDT managed to clear the country of all forms of parasites, fleas and crickets, which used keep everyone awake. DDT was magical. I hope that DTT does for television what DDT did for all the vermin that survived after the war.</P>
      <P>If a lot of extra stations come on the air it will pose a difficulty in that there will be a lowering of standards in many cases. Some of what is broadcast on foreign television stations does not do much to uphold morality. That is one of the risks we face when these stations are made available to homes across the country.</P>
      <P>I believe one must purchase a black box to get reception on DTT. I do not know whether that is a costly affair, but perhaps the Minister will explain what people must do to access this new system.</P>
      <P>I was surprised when a previous speaker mentioned that in Britain only 8 per cent were prepared to have it. I know it presents a better picture, but it will also present us with a bigger choice of pictures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE is often criticised for the drop in listenership. That is unfair. Local radio, which has done almost as much for rural Ireland as rural electrification did for it 50 years ago, has been a marvellous advance for people who want to hear what is happening locally. I feel sorry for radio producers and programme presenters in RTE who must compete with local radio. It would be almost impossible for their ratings not to drop. Local radio listenership is increasing, and one cannot listen to two radio stations at the same time. The print media should exercise common sense when it reports stories about the drop in RTE Radio 1 and 2FM listenership because local radio, which has been in existence for about ten years, seems to be improving constantly. Many people who started out as novices and amateurs in local radio stations are now quite professional. Some have <Col N="518" /> moved to RTE and others have refused offers from RTE because they are happy in their own areas.</P>
    <P>When it comes to sports coverage, local radio provides a tremendous service on Sundays. My local radio station, CKR, received the McNamee award for the best sports programme on local radio. That programme provides coverage of, and results from, all kinds of sporting events around the world. Local radio gives meaning to people's lives because it keeps them abreast of events in their areas. Even the broadcasting of death notices on local radio serves a great purpose. People might not have time to read such notices in the newspapers but they can hear them on the radio. Even though politicians are often accused of attending funerals to seek votes, in my opinion everyone should attend funerals to show their Christian values. I have no qualms about attending funerals and I take no notice of those who say I do so only to gain votes. The least we can do is offer help when people need it.</P>
    <P>Local radio stations operate under a number of disadvantages, one of which is the payment of a levy. I am glad the Bill removes that levy because local radio stations will have scope to expand their services, spend money on producing higher quality programmes and perhaps employ additional staff. The Bill also makes provision for £500,000 to be distributed among local radio stations. I do not know how much each will receive, but I suggest CKR, which has won an award, should receive the bulk of the money because of the standard of programmes it produces. I am sure the Minister will note that point.</P>
    <P>The removal of the levy and the provision of funding are two major aspects of the Bill. That is the correct way to proceed. I know local radio stations sought funding from part of the licence fee. They have a huge listenership and it is important that they should be encouraged to improve the programmes they produce, etc.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the new stations, some of which, if experience is anything to go by, might not appeal to everyone. For that reason, I support the application of United Christian Broadcasters Limited, which has tried to re-broadcast a religious programme that originates in England. A previous speaker referred to proselytising but I see nothing wrong with broadcasting a religious programme on the radio. If people want to listen to such a programme, that is fine. It might negative the effect of some of the trash being broadcast on radio and, in particular, television. There is obviously a technical difficulty in granting the United Christian Broadcasters a licence but on the basis of its worth the Minister should use her influence to ensure that is granted.</P>
    <P>Like everyone else, I have been approached by the UCB group. Long before I became familiar with it I met people in Carlow who asked me why the religious programme to which they listened had been taken off the air. I heard the programme by chance but I did not miss it after it <Col N="519" /> was taken off the air because I was not a regular listener. Many people are anxious that a religious programme of this nature should be broadcast. If its content takes the form of scripture readings, it might, as already stated, negative some of the nonsense broadcast in other programmes.</P>
    <P>This matter does not involve a sect trying to push its wares. A document relating to it was circulated to Members and I notice Bishop Brendan Comiskey is willing to support the application of the United Christian Broadcasters. Reverend Laurence Graham of the Methodist Church, Alastair Kennedy of the Presbyterian Church and Fergus A. Ryan of the Fellowship Bible Church are also willing to support it. The costs involved in allowing the broadcast to proceed will be small because the programme involves a re-broadcast of material which originates in England. I do not know if the Minister has a say in this matter. I believe the Independent Radio and Television Commission, or whatever it is now called, has responsibility in this area and it should consider this application favourably.</P>
    <P>RTE produces many political programmes which we applaud when we are shown in a favourable light but which we do not like when they fail to do so. Local radio stations, which provide a great service during election campaigns, are handicapped in this regard. I can speak only from my experience of the stations in my area, but once the candidates for the recent local elections were chosen, these stations broadcast 19 programmes designed to give an opportunity to every candidate to express their views. The stations could not charge for advertising, which is wrong. Why should RTE receive massive amounts of money for political advertising while local radio stations cannot do so? If such stations provide a service to people, particularly during local elections, why should they not be allowed to charge for advertising?</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a need to be careful and to ensure such advertising is not abused. The programmes produced by local radio stations during the local elections required a great deal of organising in a short period because they had to wait until the candidates were chosen. Everyone had the opportunity to prove whether they should be elected. One of the disadvantages of appearing on television or radio is that one can prove that one should not be elected or re-elected. It is very difficult to get the balance right.</P>
    <P>Local radio stations should be permitted to charge for advertising. Like every other commercial company, they should be entitled to make money. A great deal of money is spent on advertisements in the print media. I firmly believe much of this is wasted because people often skip over a page to avoid reading an advertisement. At least if an advertisement is played on the radio, people are inclined not to change the station and they hear it in spite of themselves, whereas a person reading the newspaper has the option of skipping ahead to the sports page or <Col N="520" /> some other page, particularly if they do not want to read about politics.</P>
    <P>Some radio programmes can be so fascinating that they can represent a threat to people listening to them while driving their cars because they do not concentrate on what they are doing. However, they help to make a journey seem much shorter, particularly if one does not have a passenger in the car. In the past, long journeys were boring, but nowadays radio offers a great choice of programmes to which one can listen.</P>
    <P>With regard to education, the entire concept of broadcasting has changed our lives a great deal because people can learn about things more quickly. In the past, they had to engage in a great deal of reading and research but now they need only turn on the television to learn about many subjects. Nature programmes, and so on, have been of great benefit to children at school. Teachers can no longer keep ahead of their students as a result of what they see on television and on the Internet. These tools have proven to be of great assistance to the entire community.</P>

      <P>conscious of the deteriorating industrial relations situation in the public sector;</P>
      <P>supportive of the re-negotiation of another partnership agreement;</P>
      <P>acknowledging that many persons have not benefited from the booming economy,</P>
      <P>calls on the Government to announce its commitment to introduce an income tax reform programme which would include the following measures:</P>
      <P>the removal of the first £170 of weekly income from income tax;</P>
      <P>the extension of the standard rate band to £17,500 in respect of single persons and £35,000 for married persons;</P>
      <P>the introduction of a new middle rate of income tax at 35 per cent which would apply to income from £17,500 to £50,000 single, and £35,000 to £100,000 married;</P>
      <P>the maintenance of the 46 per cent rate for the top 5 per cent of income tax payers;</P>
      <P>the completion of the transfer to tax credits from tax allowances;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> the commencement of the integration of the income tax and social welfare systems, and</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, aware that families with young children need particular care, calls on the Government to increase child benefit to £25 per week per child, for all children under five years of age, and to take steps, as a matter of urgency, which will increase the supply of well-managed, well-regulated, affordable child care facilities.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is committed to social partnership. The industrial peace which has resulted from the various social partnership agreements has made a major contribution to the success of the Irish economy. The widening of the social partnership agreements to include not only pay agreements but agreements on tax reductions, tax reform, improvements in social welfare, health and education and a consensus approach to other social and economic issues has been of great benefit. Fine Gael is particularly committed to Partnership 2000, which we, together with the Labour Party, negotiated when we were last in Government.</P>
    <P>Social partnership has widened and deepened the democratic process. The majority of our people now not only have their say on the future of the country when they vote at election time, but they are also represented by one or other of the social partners in the ongoing negotiation process. The inclusion of the voluntary sector and the unemployed has added further to this democratic dimension.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult to negotiate a successor to Partnership 2000. Many workers feel that the benefits of the successful economy are passing them by. They believe they are now working harder than ever before for rewards which are not significantly higher than in the past; they complain more about the levels of tax and PRSI than they do about the level of wages; they believe that a small group of people are reaping extravagant rewards from the present economic boom and that an unfair tax system operates to the detriment of the working man and woman.</P>
    <P>In primary colours, their perception is correct. I am strongly of the view that the lever which will open the door to a new partnership agreement is a tax reform and reduction package more radical than anything proposed before and certainly more radical than the half-hearted commitment to tax reform in the damp squib published by the Government last week grandiosely entitled An Action Programme for the Millennium. Fine Gael has developed and published a radical tax plan. In tonight's motion we ask Dáil Éireann to call on the Government to commit itself to implement the main elements of that plan. We make this call fully aware that as the sands of time run out for this Government, we on the Opposition benches are likely to inherit the responsibility of implementing any agreement negotiated in the current round of talks with the social partners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> The proposals Fine Gael is putting forward focus on the needs of taxpayers and the needs of the economy, and are founded on a number of principles. First we want to introduce a fair and equitable income tax system, where the burden of income tax is significantly reduced for low paid and middle income taxpayers. A fair share of the resources available to the Exchequer should be given back to those people whose hard work has contributed most to the current prosperity.</P>
    <P>We must increase the number of persons available for work. The greatest threat to growing prosperity comes from a shortage of workers. There are vacancies in every sector. The hotel and catering industry has vacancies posted in every town and village in the country. The building industry is competing site by site to bring in skilled workers. The IT sector is running out of workers, especially at the high level end. The financial services sector is also experiencing shortages.</P>
    <P>One of the best examples of what is happening has arisen in my constituency, where Dell, which has given good employment for many years, is involved in a major expansion programme. Last week it brought 150 workers from Malaysia. It set up two prayer rooms in the factory so that these workers, who are Muslim in faith, can turn toward Mecca when they are saying their prayers in the plant. The exotic detail gives an impression of the skill shortage and how far the company will go for workers. It is planning to bring in 200 people from the plant in Scotland, which does not have the same level of orders. That is after bussing people from south Kerry, Fermoy, Cork city and north Clare to Limerick city. They have run out of assembly line workers.</P>
    <P>The greatest threat now facing our economy &ndash; the Minister shares this perception &ndash; is that the country is running out of workers. If that happens the boom will not continue. If the country runs out of workers, there are only three sources of additional workers. We must move more people from welfare to work, attract into the labour market those women who are now working at home and include more immigrants in the labour force, whether they are young people who live overseas, those from EU countries availing of the right to freedom of movement or people from even further afield. There are no other options.</P>
    <P>The ability to attract workers is sensitive to the tax system. If we remove the low paid from the tax net to ensure they have a living wage, there will be further encouragement to move from welfare to work. By dramatically reducing the number of persons who pay tax at the higher rate, we can also increase the labour force, so that people on low and middle income pay tax at the standard rate only and women who are at home are encouraged to rejoin the labour force. We can also ensure that emigrants who wish to return to work in Ireland are not discouraged from doing so by significantly higher tax regimes than they would experience in the countries where they cur<Col N="523" /> rently work, particularly the United States and Britain.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the proposals Fine Gael is putting forward. Our first proposal is that all those up to the level of the minimum wage should be removed from the tax net completely. Their first £170 of income per week should be exempt. It is invidious that the Government proposes to introduce a minimum wage next year of £4.40 per hour but to tax half of it at the same time. It makes no sense to decide on a policy which says that to give people enough to live, it is necessary to legislate for a minimum wage and then to tax it. I am calculating the minimum wage on the basis of a 39 hour week at £4.40 per hour. The exemption amounts to approximately £170 per week. However, in our progressive tax system I am referring to the removal of the first £170 in income from the tax net for all workers and not only those on the minimum wage. This should be done through increased tax allowances expressed as tax credits and by introducing a new proposal which I call an &ldquo;earned income tax credit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For many years, until the last budget, the PAYE allowance stood at £800. Governments were reluctant to raise it above this figure for two reasons. First, it only applied to PAYE workers and if it was significantly enhanced the Minister for Finance could have faced legal action from self-employed persons who would not receive such an allowance. The second reason was that in the allowance system which prevailed if one paid tax at the top rate, 46 per cent, the benefit of an increase in the PAYE allowance would be much more significant than at the standard rate. Governments were also reluctant to increase it because it was introduced in the first instance to allow for the fact that employees incurred expenses going to work and at work and PAYE workers generally pay tax on everything. They did not have the tax avoidance systems or the perks which were enjoyed by taxpayers elsewhere in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister increased the PAYE allowance in the last budget from £800 to £1,000 and turned it into a tax credit which is only enjoyed at the standard rate. There is great merit in increasing it and Fine Gael proposes an increase to £3,600 to be paid by way of tax credit of £864 for all taxpayers. We also propose that the single person's allowance should be raised by £1,000 and that of married persons by £2,000. The move from the standard rate of tax to the higher rate kicks in at an income level which is much too low. At £14,100 every nurse in Ireland even before the strike, paid tax at the higher rate. Every bus driver in Dublin probably pays tax at the higher rate; they certainly do if they are single. If people are to be encouraged to return to work, especially married women, this must be increased significantly.</P>
    <P>When a woman is deciding whether to stay at home or return to work she is only concerned with the higher tax rate because her spouse has already consumed on any reasonable income all <Col N="524" /> the allowances and the entire range of the standard rate band. The effective range of tax for spouses, who are generally women, deciding to go back to work is 46 per cent plus PRSI and its range must be extended dramatically. We propose that it should be extended to £17,500 and £35,000. This figure is not plucked from the air in an arbitrary fashion. The average industrial wage is £15,800 while the average wage is approximately £17,200. The CSO is not as precise with the average wage as it is with the industrial average wage. It is reasonable, looking to the future, that people on the average wage or less should not be liable to the higher rate of tax.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also proposes that a new 35 per cent rate of tax should be introduced. Taking one or two points off the top rate meets the needs of the economy. A new rate of tax is needed to apply to a tranche of income which most people returning from abroad or most women returning to work, if on a joint income, would experience. The new rate should extend to single people earning between £17,500 and £50,000 and married persons earning between £35,000 and £100,000. When these proposals were published, people asked whether the higher rate should apply to people earning an average income of £100,000.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the proposal is that, according to Forfás, there are 190,000 people abroad who would be prepared to return to Ireland. Many of them are single and in their present places of employment they enjoy salaries of between £40,000 and £60,000, especially those who work in the IT and financial services industries. If something serious is to be done about a lower rate of tax, such as a 35 per cent rate, the upper limit must be £50,000 for single persons if we are to attract them back into the economy. As a result of the Murphy case, our interpretation is that figure should be doubled for married persons. The thinking was not to pitch it at £100,000 but the figure is a consequence of pitching it at £50,000 for single people. However, if the figure is any lower than £50,000 for single persons, it will not have the effect of attracting people back from the US or the UK where tax rates are much lower than in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also proposes that the integration of the tax and social welfare systems should begin quickly. As a pilot project, the Minister should first try to integrate the family income supplement in the tax system. The full value of certain allowances, such as the incapacitated child allowance, the dependent relative's allowance and the blind person's allowance should be maintained if the Minister changes these to tax credits in the budget. They will have to be raised to the point where at least there is no loss to the recipient. The same applies to exemption limits which must be raised significantly, especially for pensioners.</P>
    <P>We also propose that child benefit should be increased. It is the most effective and equitable way of providing families with children with extra income. It should be increased to £25 per week <Col N="525" /> in respect of all children under five years. Fine Gael is conscious that many women who want to return to work are prevented because well regulated, managed and affordable child care is not available. Our proposal to increase child benefit will significantly help families with children under five years.</P>
    <P>However, there is also a supply problem which hits all families regardless of their level of income. Even when parents can afford child care, quite frequently the facilities simply are not available. There is a huge shortage of child care places and the Government must also address this problem, not just for the good of children and to facilitate parents, but for the sake of the economy and anyone with an interest in maintaining economic progress. Child care is now not only a family and social issue, but is one of the foremost economic issues facing Ireland because women are driven from the workforce as a result of the unavailability of affordable child care places and Ireland is totally out of line with its European partners.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's tax proposals will cost approximately £2 billion. The child care proposals will cost an additional £225 million and sums of this magnitude are big when one considers them from an historical perspective. However, they can be afforded over the lifetime of a wage agreement which is negotiated on the premise that moderate wage increases are accepted in exchange for strong tax packages and a number of social objectives which can be attained. Everything is relative and the budgets of 1997, 1998 and 1999 spanning two Administrations reduced income tax by £1.5 billion. Despite that reduction income tax receipts increased from £5.22 billion in 1997 to an estimated £6.25 billion for 1999. Not alone did the two Governments give back £1.5 billion, they collected £1 billion extra in income tax alone.</P>
    <P>However, what appears to be big is not so when one is dealing with underestimation of buoyancy of income tax year after year. Some £1 billion more is being collected now by way of income tax than was collected three budgets ago, even though £1.5 million has been given back. It is not unreasonable to talk in billions and certainly adoption of our proposals will not eliminate the budget surplus. There will be three budgets over the next two years. Fine Gael in Government would negotiate moderate wage increases in return for a radical tax package along the lines of our proposals.</P>
    <P>In its programme for Government, the Government promised that 80 per cent of taxpayers would pay tax at the standard rate only. At the time the promise was made 60 per cent of taxpayers paid at the standard rate but 40 per cent paid at the higher rate. At present 44 per cent pay at the higher rate and 56 pay at the standard rate only. The Government, rather than progressing to deliver on its commitment, has galloped off in the opposite direction. In its new programme for Government, published last week, it has virtually abandoned its position with a new watered-down promise that it will ensure that a <Col N="526" /> large majority of taxpayers will be subject to no more than the standard rate. Will the Minister say what exactly is meant by a large majority of taxpayers, other than that it is a formula of words to welsh on the commitment given in the original programme.</P>
    <P>The Government frequently refers to the record tax relief it has delivered in its previous budgets. The amount given &ndash; when you look at the outturns &ndash; after buoyancy is included at the end of the year, is significantly less than what it appears to be on budget day.</P>
    <P>It is worth remembering that the labour force has increased by about 40 per cent in the past five years or so. Consequently the number of taxpayers has increased by about 40 per cent. Any relief which the Minister gives on income tax on 1 December will be spread over about 400,000 additional people above what it was, say, five years ago. When we speak of record tax packages of £700,000 or £700 million, they are records but are spread over a record labour force and the butter is spread much more thinly than it appears. That is why when people are paid in May they are always disappointed with the tax relief in the budget and they will be disappointed again this year. Even if the Minister delivers between £700 million and £800 million they will still be disappointed because of the numbers involved and the Exchequer is taking in more and more proportionately every year. A more radical approach is needed. The taxes system needs to be changed along the lines the motion proposes.</P>
    <P>I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion and to congratulate Deputy Noonan on his imaginative proposals. It is worth noting that few commentators have opposed Deputy Noonan's document which has been well thought out and costed. It contains practical proposals to deal with present trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that a year after the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announces the budget on 1 December, we will learn it is so much ahead of target. I often wonder at the reasons for this. I am aware of the upturn in employment and of buoyancy in the economy. Perhaps some of the proposals in the Fine Gael document will continue that trend. People will work if they get the opportunity. On the other hand there is not any Member here who has not had people come to him and say they would like to take on a job but in doing so would lose certain benefits. There is nothing wrong with people having those benefits but when the State takes away the incentive to employment and a contribution to society and the well-being of that person there is something wrong. There is always a cry for people who are on the borderline of poverty etc. who need State benefits and who, for one reason or another, are unable to work but for those who are able and willing to work the State should not place barriers in their way. The proposal that the first £170 of weekly income be exempt from tax is a start and <Col N="527" /> a step in the right direction. I hope the Minister will include those type of proposals in his budget. There must be an incentive to work. Nobody likes paying tax.</P>
    <P>On Sunday evening the Tánaiste appeared on television &ndash; a preamble to Glenroe &ndash; to say that tax would be reduced and that was what she wanted to see in the budget. Is there anybody in Ireland who does not want to see tax reduced in the budget. I have yet to meet someone who does not want a tax reduction but it must be done in a practical way. The Fine Gael party has always stood for a good balance in tax right across the board. This is the opportunity for the Minister to do something positive</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Noonan. Very few commentators gave a negative response to the document put forward by Fine Gael and Deputy Noonan. I urge the Minister to consider some of its proposals in the budget. I wish the Minister well. I thank him for the rural renewal scheme which is up and running. There is a good response to the scheme in my county and constituency. The Minister resisted the pressure and got it through.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on bringing this motion before the House. It is an imaginative, radical approach to taxation and is what is needed at this time. Its attractions are the benefits to the economy, which he outlined, all of which are badly needed. We have not ever had so much money in the economy. That has its own dangers, one of the greatest of which is that we are running out of workers. This motion is designed to further stimulate the economy and keep it on track.</P>
      <P>I met a couple recently who told me they could not afford to have children because of their high mortgage. They also had a lodger who was helping to pay the mortgage. Child care is extraordinarily expensive. This is a major problem right across the economy. I appeal to the Minister to look at this issue. It is a scandal that many couples cannot afford to have a child. That is serious. That people on a minimum wage should be exempted from taxation is a sensible approach and one with which I agree. We cannot try to attract people into the workplace and say they will be taxed. That definitely makes sense.</P>
      <P>There is a notion that on reaching the age of 65 or 66 a person has to retire. Many Members have reached that age and have yet to retire. Older persons should be encouraged to remain on in the workforce a little longer if they so wish. This would help to increase worker numbers. The less that is taken in tax the more that is ploughed back into the economy. This motion is going down that road. The position of widows aged 60 to 66 needs to be looked at. Many are suffering needlessly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever I am asked in schools what I do in this House I reply that we legislate, raise and spend taxes and call Ministers to account. Most can do so. Taxation is a crucial issue. I commend <Col N="528" /> my colleague, Deputy Noonan, for tabling the motion. The proposals contained therein have been costed and would lead to wage moderation and help to avoid industrial unrest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on bringing forward the motion which is timely in the context of the budget which is due to be announced on 1 December. Many previous holders of his office envy the Minister in terms of the position in which he finds himself. There is Exchequer buoyancy which brings its own difficulties as choices have to be made and priority given to specific projects in distributing the largesse given to us by the workforce. To coin a phrase, it is payback time. The motion outlines practical ways in which we can give workers back as much of their money as possible in a focused way to release some of the blockages and clear the logjams in the economy.</P>
      <P>While there is unprecendented Exchequer buoyancy, there are also the serious problems of wage inflation, in the private sector much more so than in the public sector &ndash; this is often forgotten &ndash; escalating house prices and the lack of child care facilities. The most effective and appropriate way of intervening to resolve these problems without conceding on the issue of percentage wage increases which are often less beneficial to those who need help most, is through the tax system.</P>
      <P>On child care, if there was an adequate payment available &ndash; the motion proposes that child benefit be increased to £25 per week for all children under five years of age &ndash; it would release a significant number of people to participate in the workforce.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Stanton said, we are often too quick to cast on the scrapheap people in their late fifties and early sixties who still have a considerable amount to offer the economy. Incentives should be offered to facilitate their return to the workforce. They are probably available in greater numbers than those who might benefit from the increased availability of child care facilities. This should be considered given that measures have been taken in the past to facilitate new entrants to the workforce.</P>
      <P>Home ownership is now out of reach of a large number of people who might have been expected to put a roof over their heads. They are placing their names on local authority housing lists with practically no hope of securing accommodation. Exempting the first £170 of weekly income from income tax and focusing tax reductions on where they would deliver maximum benefit by empowering individuals to provide for themselves, be it in housing, health care or education, is the way forward.</P>
      <P>These are the challenges facing the Minister. The blueprint presented by Deputy Noonan is well thought out, costed and attainable in the context of the public finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael income tax document contains radical proposals as we move towards the new millennium. As my colleague, Deputy Creed, said the Minister is lucky to have so much money available. We, as politicians, and the Government in particular have to look at the issue of financial control in a new and imaginative way.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with my colleague, Deputy Noonan, that one of the greatest difficulties facing the economy is the labour shortage. This can be dealt with in a number of ways. Employers in the private sector in particular are finding it difficult to attract staff. It is imperative that those on low incomes are looked after. I fully endorse therefore Fine Gael's proposal that the first £170 of weekly income should be tax free.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest difficulties facing the economy is the vexed question of public service pay. In the 1980s, as the private sector was not providing sufficient opportunities, many had no choice but to seek employment in the civil and public service. The private sector is now providing opportunities but unable to attract staff. The Government should therefore look seriously at introducing an embargo in the civil and public service to ensure the jobs available in the private sector are filled and thus achieve a balance in both services. In 1975 there were fewer than 1,000 administrators in the Eastern Health Board. Today there are more than 11,000. Is it necessary in a country of this size to have that many? It would be more beneficial to spend the money on frontline staff. This is one of the reasons we have had a nurses' dispute. All political parties will have to look at this issue in a more imaginative way. This includes considering the introduction of an embargo in the civil and public service. People would willingly work in the private sector. Employers are finding it next to impossible to recruit staff.</P>
      <P>The lack of child care facilities is another serious problem facing the economy. Deputy Noonan's proposal that child benefit be increased to £25 per week for all children under five years of age is imaginative. Many women working in the home are not in a position to seriously consider entering the workplace as they would be unable to meet the cost of child care services.</P>
      <P>Along with my colleague, Deputy Belton, I compliment the Minister on introducing the rural renewal scheme in the County Leitrim. It has been successful and I hope the Minister will extend it to the year 2005.</P>

      <P>I will do that after the next election.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Government for, its progressive economic policies which have resulted in:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the achievement of rapid economic and social progress;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" />&ndash;the large increases in employment and the significant fall in unemployment, including long-term unemployment, over the past two years;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the pursuit of prudent and sensible budgetary policies since 1997 which have responded to the country's immediate needs while preparing for the longer-term, and</P>
    <P>&ndash;its programme of tax reform which has resulted in:</P>
    <P>&ndash;reducing the burden of taxation on all taxpayers;</P>
    <P>&ndash;increasing the incentives to take up work;</P>
    <P>&ndash;removing large numbers of low-income earners from the tax net altogether;</P>
    <P>&ndash;reducing the burden of taxation, particularly on the lower paid, the aged and widowed parents;</P>
    <P>&ndash;initiation of major change towards a more progressive system of tax credits, maintaining and improving our competitiveness,</P>
    <P>and calls on the Government to continue its programme of tax reform through an appropriately balanced mix of measures in the next and subsequent Budgets.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contribution to the tax policy debate which this Private Members' motion affords the House. While different sides may disagree on the choices to be made in some tax areas, it is helpful to the debate on important policy issues for Opposition parties to set out clearly where they stand and to seek to have these issues subjected to the scrutiny of this Chamber. This is the role of legislative debate and entirely proper to this House. It helps clarify the objectives that are being sought in the public interest, the range of options available, the choices between different strategies, the role of tax-based versus expenditure-based initiatives and the effect of different options on the equity of the tax system. One area in particular which has benefited from open debate, analysis and reflection has been the child care issue, where, at the expense of some criticism, the Government came to the view last year that the issue raised more complex issues than appeared to be the case to many, and required something other than a series of reactive measures.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies opposite have been careful and constructive in their handling of tax policy proposals and I hope they will regard my response in the same light. I suffer under one major disability in this debate in that it is three weeks to the budget and I cannot, nor would I wish to outline tonight what measures that will contain. I am sure the House will understand if I dwell more on what has been done by the Government and the policies we are committed to, rather than outlining specific measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> The amended motion before the House calls on the Dáil to support the Government in its economic and budgetary policies which have brought such positive results to this country since we took office in terms of economic and social progress, substantial tax reductions, major tax reform, unprecedented employment creation, the incentive to work and greater equity in the distribution of public resources. Over its remaining term in office, the Government is committed to further substantial measures to strengthen and deepen investment in key areas of the physical, economic and social infrastructure, to further reform the operation of the tax system and to the fair distribution of the fruits of economic growth. This is evident in the policy programme review published by the Government parties last week and will be further evidenced in the National Development Plan to be published next week.</P>
    <P>It is an unusual and satisfying task for a Minister for Finance to be able to point to such a record of achievement in such a short time and to be able to say to this House that we delivered in large measure on what was promised in the tax area when we sought a mandate from the electorate, and that in so far as commitments remain to be fulfilled, we are determined to do what can be done to achieve these in our remaining term in office.</P>
    <P>The economic success story of this economy in recent years is little short of remarkable. The reasons for this success can be traced to a number of factors working in combination. Some of these are due to decisions taken in the 1960s in the area of education, for example. Others are more recent, including the commitment of successive Governments, and this Government in particular, to fiscal stability, prudent economic and budgetary management, continuing social partnership, investment in ongoing infrastructural needs and targeted reductions in the tax burden.</P>
    <P>The continuation of economic and social progress is a key aim of this Government. Any examination of our record over the past two and a half years shows that we are achieving this objective. It is worth noting that between 1997 and the end of this year, GNP is projected to have expanded in volume terms by about a quarter; the numbers in work grew by more than 10 per cent in the two years to March 1999; and as a result the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 per cent in 1997 to its current level of 5.2 per cent. Despite this strong growth, inflation has remained under control and has averaged less than 2 per cent over the period. Meanwhile, the burden of Government debt has been reduced significantly and is now among the lowest in the EU. The Government has also managed to reduce the tax burden while making significant investments in our public services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> The performance of the economy has been better than anyone had forecast. Two years ago, a period of slower growth was forecast by most commentators. Growth rates, however, have shown little sign of easing. Official statistics show that the economy expanded by 9 per cent in 1997 and by more than 8 per cent last year. This is the strongest growth, by some distance, of any EU member.</P>
    <P>The improvement in our economic well-being is most in evidence in the jobs market. We have made considerable progress in addressing the economic and social problem that unemployment creates. The Government gave a clear commitment to reduce unemployment in the programme for Government when it came into office in 1997, and we have delivered with the number of people on the live register at its lowest level in 17 years.</P>
    <P>The fall in unemployment is mainly due to record jobs growth. The latest data indicate that employment increased by more than 96,000 in the year to May 1999, or by almost 6.5 per cent, bringing the numbers at work to almost 1.6 million &ndash; the highest level in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>One of the Government's main achievements has been the fall in the number of long-term unemployed. The long-term unemployed rate fell to 2.5 per cent in May 1999, less than half the level it was when this Government was elected. It is clear that more people who were excluded from the labour market are now benefiting from the employment opportunities that exist.</P>
    <P>The fall in the unemployment rate is a clear indication of the Government's successful policies. However, the Government is not resting on its laurels. The economic progress of the 1990s has given us a new set of challenges. We set ourselves a new set of objectives in the recently announced Action Plan for the Millennium including, among others, to achieve full employment, and effectively eliminate long-term unemployment; to renew and sustain the social partnership approach which has brought such gains over the past 12 years; to complete a substantial reduction in the income tax burden on the average taxpayer; to diminish substantially the incidence of poverty; to introduce a proper child support system; to provide affordable housing for our population and to ease the transport and other infrastructural bottlenecks through a major public investment programme, including public private partnerships; and to achieve a more balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>Labour market developments, in particular, point to a shift in emphasis. We now have to deal with the problems of success. The rapid rate of growth is not without its challenges. An emerging shortage of labour is one of those new problems that we now face. We are all aware of a new phenomenon in Ireland &ndash; advertisements in shop windows looking for potential employees. It is not too long ago that such advertisements <Col N="533" /> would have generated a queue of enthusiastic applicants. This is just the most visible sign of the way the labour market has changed, and the current pressures it now contains. These pressures are leading to some wage inflation which, unless addressed, will reduce competitiveness and hinder economic growth. Addressing these problems is one of the key objectives of policy.</P>
    <P>This Government has responded with imagination to the changed labour market situation. We have taken a number of important steps to address emerging shortages of labour: a skills advisory group was established to provide policy advice on shortages. On foot of recommendations by this group, the number of places at third level for IT education was increased. Taxation changes in the 1999 budget improved incentives for many of the low paid. These changes removed 80,000 from the tax net and provided an incentive for many more to take up the employment opportunities on offer. We also took steps in the 1999 budget to facilitate and encourage the supply of child care places to meet the growing need for such facilities. Ireland has one of the highest levels of expenditure on active labour market programmes in Europe. These programmes have been focused on reintegrating the long-term unemployed back into the labour market. These programmes have been successful. Our new situation presents a challenge in refocusing the objectives of these initiatives in light of changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>Our successful performance to date is testimony to the sound employment policies we have put in place. However, efforts will continue to be made by fiscal and other policy measures to increase the supply of labour. As Deputies are aware, throughout my political life I have drawn attention to the issue of the national debt problem, and the consequences for our economic well-being if the public finances are not managed prudently. In the programme for Government, we gave a commitment to eliminate the Exchequer borrowing requirement and to run a budget surplus. These objectives have already been achieved. In 1998 we achieved a budget surplus of 2.1 per cent of GNP. In my budget last December I aimed for a budget surplus of 1.7 per cent and for a debt-GNP ratio of 52 per cent.</P>
    <P>The latest indications suggest that 1999 will be another very good year for the Exchequer. This very buoyant performance indicates that there will be a significant improvement on the budget day target for the Exchequer surplus. At the end of September, the Exchequer surplus for 1999 was forecast to be in the region of £1,700 million, exclusive of receipts from the Telecom Éireann share flotation. In general Government terms, the surplus is expected to be about 3 per cent of GDP compared to a budget day target of 1.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>This budgetary performance puts us in a good position to absorb the reduction in EU receipts <Col N="534" /> over the coming years, while addressing the infrastructure and other challenges we face. Likewise, it enables us to prepare now for the longer-term costs associated with the progressive ageing of the population. I am determined to continue with these policies and to resist the calls by some to spend all the fruits of economic growth. By saving now and putting funds aside for future pensions or reducing the burden of debt, we are creating the leeway to meet future pension and health expenditures as the population ages without the difficult budgetary restraint that would otherwise be required. We are also preparing the public finances for the inevitable periods of slower economic growth that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party amendment to the motion calls for the abandonment of the 4 per cent ceiling on public spending and its replacement by a higher figure which implies spending the increased tax resources as they come in. I do not intend to pursue this course. The Government owes it to the taxpayer to continue to be prudent in the management of its resources while meeting clear and necessary public spending needs. To spend all now would inevitably create problems later on, and would certainly reduce very considerably the resources available for the sort of tax measures in terms of substantially increasing allowances and widening the standard rate income tax band to £20,000 single and £40,000 married for which that party is calling.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the country's infrastructure must be developed. Economic growth has been much more rapid than anticipated while the population has also grown by more than expected. The strain that economic growth is now putting on our infrastructure is becoming very evident. To put it in simple terms &ndash; parts of our public infrastructure are finding it hard to cope leading to congestion, delays and some frustration.</P>
    <P>These problems cannot be solved overnight. Planning and building infrastructure takes a long-time. I share the frustration of many with the slow pace of the planning process. However, even with a much improved system, it would take a number of years to develop our infrastructure to the extent required. Increasing expenditure in this area has been one of our key priorities. The facts speak for themselves. Capital expenditure rose by more than 20 per cent in 1998 and in 1999.</P>
    <P>However, this increased expenditure has to be maintained and built upon in the years ahead. The National Development Plan will set out our investment plans to 2006. There has been much speculation about the contents of this plan and I do not intend to add further to these varied reports. However, I assure Deputies that they will find the plan is an imaginative and creative response to our infrastructural problems.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the tax commitments of this Government were clearly set out in the Govern<Col N="535" /> ment programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, and were restated as recently as last week in our programme review. The Government's strategy is to reduce the burden of taxation so as to reward effort, improve the incentive to take up work and maintain and improve competitiveness. It is a five year strategy. The elements of this strategy in personal taxation are: removal of low paid taxpayers from the tax net altogether; reduction of the current income tax rates; increasing the numbers of taxpayers on the standard rate and moving to a full tax credits system.</P>
    <P>Budget 2000 will build on the very substantial progress which has already been made in budget 1998 and budget 1999 through the appropriate mix of tax measures. Our fiscal policies will ensure that the foundations which we have laid for future economic progress and social inclusion will be strengthened and secured.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 promised total personal tax reductions of £900 million over the three years of the agreement as part of the overall strategy for continued economic and social development underpinned by wage moderation. It also promised increases in after tax income for those on the average industrial wage of up to 14 per cent, or close to 5 per cent each year. In fact, over the period of Partnership 2000, total tax reductions have amounted to £1,500 million, of which £1,100 million was delivered in my two budgets. Over the same period, average tax rates have fallen significantly for all taxpayers. It is estimated that the combined effect of tax reductions and pay increases will give increases in net take home pay over the period of Partnership 2000 of 18 per cent to 21 per cent for most taxpayers between 1997 and the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>With the £1.1 billion of tax reductions which I delivered in my two budgets &ndash; £517 million in 1998 and £581 million in 1999, I have been able to implement the most significant tax reform measures of any Minister for Finance in the history of the State. I have been able to be in the process of reducing tax rates for everyone. I have taken more than 80,000 taxpayers out of the tax net altogether. I have been able to focus relief on those most vulnerable to financial difficulties &ndash;  those over 65 who have benefited from up to 40 per cent increases in the elderly person's exemption limit; widowed parents, for whom the bereavement allowance has been increased and the long-term unemployed, through the job assist scheme. I have also started the move to a full tax credits system which ensures a fairer distribution of tax benefits to all taxpayers especially those at the lower end of the income tax scale.</P>
    <P>In my first budget, I concentrated on the Government's commitments to rate reductions, reducing both the top and standard rates of tax by 2 per cent to 24 per cent and 46 per cent <Col N="536" /> respectively. I also provided for increases in the personal allowances. In budget 1999, I continued this programme of very substantial tax reform. In my last budget, I placed the main emphasis on reducing the burden of tax on the lower paid so as to further improve the incentive to take up work and improve the position of the less advantaged in the community. Budget 1999 increased personal allowances so that a single person on PAYE does not pay any tax on income below £100 per week. I announced the move to a full tax credits system and I introduced the standard rating of PAYE and personal allowances as the beginning of this process.</P>
    <P>Tax credits mean that the value of personal allowances is equalised &ndash; it is a fundamental and progressive reform of the tax system. A Partnership 2000 working group has been examining the approaches for standard rating the remaining allowances and in budget 2000, I will announce a timetable for completion of the move to a full tax credits system.</P>
    <P>I also cut the rate of capital gains tax to stimulate investment &ndash; a policy move which, I read, has caught on on the other side of the Irish sea. I made the first substantive and radical change in the area of pension tax policy to encourage pension provision and to give those saving for pensions greater choice and control over their personal pension packages. Here too I have received expressions of interest from overseas observers regarding the pension initiatives which we have undertaken. In my forthcoming budget I intend to address the areas of CAT and the real issues and concerns shared by many Deputies over the growing imposition created by the incidence of this tax on persons who are by no means wealthy or well off.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that it is good to see parties putting specific tax proposals before the House for discussion and analysis. There are common goals and some of these proposals which I share, namely, removing taxpayers from the tax net and widening the standard band to increase the entry point to the 46 per cent rate. I too have reflected on whether an intermediate rate of tax between the standard and higher rate might be a useful policy tool. The particular income tax structure of an intermediate rate between the standard and top rate has an appeal on the face of it. However, it raises the issue of whether there should be a special introductory rate, perhaps 10 per cent, for low earners. However, once we go down that road we will soon have the multi-rate structure of the early 1980s which resulted in six rates in 1983-84 &ndash; 25 per cent, 35 per cent, 45 per cent, 55 per cent, 60 per cent and 65 per cent. I prefer to keep matters simple &ndash; reduce direct tax rates, put more taxpayers on the standard rate and keep the low paid out of the tax net. Achieving this does not require a new rate structure but a determination to pursue a consistent policy of tax <Col N="537" /> reductions over a continuing period &ndash; a determination which this Government has shown its two budgets and on which more will be delivered shortly.</P>
    <P>One feature of the Fine Gael proposal for a new intermediate rate of 35 per cent is that it effectively cuts the top rate of tax for nearly all those on 46 per cent very substantially and focuses the gains towards the higher end of the income scale. The Labour Party proposal for a widening of the standard band by over 40 per cent also focuses a large element of gain on the upper end of the income distribution. I hope that this effect of widening the standard band is understood and appreciated by those putting it forward. Whether such measures are the appropriate policy response is a matter ultimately for the electorate. As far as the Government is concerned the options of cutting income tax rates remain on the agenda and the level of the top tax rate is a factor which influences work incentives and labour supply in certain important areas. All the relevant aspects of the income tax system as regards the equity and efficiency of the system will be taken into account in framing the measures I will announce on budget day.</P>
    <P>The budget will also set out our response to the child care issue. There are many and conflicting demands on this issue. The Government sought to focus on increasing the supply of child care by its tax initiatives announced last year. There is also a considerable demand for assistance to parents in meeting child care expenses. Some pre-budget submissions call for tax relief for such expenses. Others place the emphasis on increases in child benefit or special taxable payments to parents in addition to child benefit. The House will be aware, thanks to the informed debate of the past year, of the relative merits of tax based measures in focusing relief <i>versus</i> the case for universal type payments which go to all. I am not going to add to the debate except to welcome the greater clarity and common sense which have entered this arena since last year.</P>
    <P>Finally, to end on a topic where many will say our recent economic prosperity began, I would like to refer to the issue of social partnership. Deputies will be aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently voted by an overwhelming majority to enter talks on a new national partnership agreement. The talks have now commenced and the Government, for its part, is determined to make every effort on its side to ensure that an appropriate new agreement is put in place. The overriding consideration for all involved in discussions on a new agreement must be the continuation of sustainable and equitable economic growth and prudent economic management. We are anxious to negotiate a new national programme with the social partners on mutually satisfactory terms. One goal is an assurance that there will be industrial peace in the public service <Col N="538" /> and that the pay provisions of the agreement will be adhered to in practice.</P>
    <P>Because of EMU, we no longer have an exchange rate instrument at our disposal with which to influence short run competitiveness. Therefore, incomes across the economy will have to be flexible to handle unexpected developments. Pay determination in the public service has to move away from the very rigid system of relativities that has operated in the past. The Government intends to be creative in seeking solutions to the economic and social issues that we face and supportive in the use of budgetary policy so that we can continue to secure the interests and economic and social well being of all those who work and live in this country. I am happy to commend the amended motion to the House.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;aware of the fact that people enter the tax net at too low an income and graduate to the marginal rate too early;</P>
      <P>&ndash;aware of the existence of poverty and employment traps for low income earners, calls on the Government to announce its commitment in advance of negotiations on a new national agreement to:</P>
      <P>&ndash;an increase in the proposed national minimum wage to £5 an hour and to the removal of this level on income from the tax net altogether;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the extension of the standard rate band to £20,000 for single people and £40,000 for married couples; but also mindful of the serious inadequacies in many public services including:</P>
      <P>&ndash;growing waiting lists in the acute hospital sector;</P>
      <P>&ndash;an unprecedented housing crisis;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the failure of the Government to meet its targets for overseas development aid;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the continuing existence of class sizes in our primary schools in excess of 30 students;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the inadequate funding of public transport;</P>
      <P>&ndash;lengthening queues for appointments with legal aid solicitors, amongst other things, calls on the Government to abandon its commitment to a 4 per cent ceiling in public spending increases in favour of a figure commensurate with either the rate of GNP growth as outlined in the NESC report or the projected increase in taxation income, whichever is higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest charge levelled at politics and politicians is that we are all the same. I do not agree with this charge and will outline why in my contribution. The primary choice in politics is <Col N="539" /> how the State's resources are allocated, how much taxes are levied and what level of services are provided. That question could scarcely be more relevant today when the State's coffers are over-full. The Labour Party's response to that question differs from that of other parties. It is a position which seeks to respond to what we believe to be the most significant problem in society, namely, that the public services provided by the State are increasingly inadequate to meet the needs and reasonable expectations of a 21st century, civilised European society. It is not just our physical infrastructure which has failed to keep pace with recent economic growth, but the care we offer the elderly, people with disabilities and children is not commensurate with one of the wealthiest societies in the world.</P>
    <P>The period before Christmas is important in any financial year but it is a good deal more significant this year than most. Negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000 started today, the Government's spending Estimates for 2000 are to be published later this week, the national plan for the next seven years is finally to be published at the beginning of next week and the ministerial financial statement for next year is set for 1 December. This means that in the next few weeks we will make decisions and choices which will seriously impact on how we run the country over the next few years. In a real sense we will be setting the tone for the new century.</P>
    <P>In some ways this debate serves a useful purpose, but in other ways it does nothing of the sort. Its primary and perfectly reasonable purpose is to allow Fine Gael to engage in a bit of populism by promising tax reductions to just about everyone. In a sense it is difficult to blame Fine Gael and I do not blame it. It is not easy for an Opposition party to resist the opportunity to write an imaginary cheque for its target voters with a promise of more to come in the future. That said, and I do not say this in a high and mighty sense, I believe it is a temptation we should resist at this time.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Minister in coming to the House is to say as little as possible. We are asked to accept a fairly anodyne string of meaningless clichés because it would be wrong to expect the Minister to say anything else in the three or four weeks before the budget. The Minister knows my views on budget secrecy, which is not something I accept as necessary. It is an antiquated system of budgeting. We cannot say the accountability of the Minister for Finance to the House stops a few weeks after the Finance Act as it apparently does under the current system. Currently the Minister apparently feels he is entitled to avoid all questions on taxation policy and budgetary strategy for the rest of the year on the grounds that he is contemplating what to put in to his next budget. In effect it means the Minister is accountable to the House for a few short months between, roughly, December and February and can then retire to the comfortable closet <Col N="540" /> of the Department which will assiduously help him, despite some improvements in recent years, in maintaining as much silence as possible.</P>
    <P>As an example in this regard a few weeks ago I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister seeking estimates of the yearly implications of spending decisions which had already been announced and published by the Government. I got a slightly convoluted but nonetheless fairly direct response from the Department saying that unfortunately the information could not be put together and in any event it would serve &ldquo;no useful purpose&rdquo;. I can understand why it might be tedious for the Department to put such information together, but it can hardly say the information is not available. I know the Department monitors actual spending on a month by month basis and I imagine it keeps a very careful eye on the implications year on year of spending decisions. I suspect what really happened was that the Department wanted to get on with the serious business of deciding next year's Estimates and did not really want to engage in the business of public debate. That is a feature of the way in which we deal with spending decisions. The Minister will agree that spending decisions are at least as important as the tax decisions on which we focus so much attention.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the substance of the debate and, in my short contribution, raise two issues. First, in as much as I can I want to dispel the notion that there is a consensus in the House on budgetary and economic strategy. Second, I want to make the case for increased spending on services.</P>
    <P>I will set out the elements of the apparent consensus which my party does not accept. I relate these elements in some way to what the Government announced recently in its renewed programme. First, I do not accept the notion that it is necessarily a good thing to run &ldquo;a substantial budget surplus&rdquo;, the words which are usually used. This can only be done if we continue to run down public services which are already under funded. Second, I do not accept that the Government's public spending, as defined by the Minister, should be limited to 4 per cent in nominal terms at a time when growth is running at twice that figure and tax revenues are increasing by nearly three times that amount. Third, we should not be seeking to pay off the national debt ahead of time.</P>
    <P>I was interested by the element in the programme which, if memory serves me correctly, commits the Government to reducing the debt burden to below 40 per cent of GDP before the end of 2002. I am not quite sure how radical a proposition that is. I understand the current figure is about 58 per cent of GDP, or 52 per cent of GNP according to the figure in the Minister's speech. If one allows for growth of 5 or 6 per cent per year for the next few years, the debt burden, assuming we do not borrow any more, will fall in any event to about 46 or 47 per cent. Therefore, all one has to do is use a few bob from privatis<Col N="541" /> ation receipts and the figure will fall below 40 per cent and I am not sure how much of a difference there is between us on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that issue. I am not sure how radical the Government's proposal is, even though on the face of it the figures seem quite stark. We should not seek to pay off the national debt ahead of time. If we continue to pay it off as it falls due we will in any event reduce it very quickly to a low level by EU standards relative to GNP or GDP.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we should be seeking to reduce public spending as a percentage of national income to a level below the current rate. Again one can get into all sorts of tortuous comparisons with GNP and GDP. I make this point because the Government's stability programme as submitted last year to the EU Commission commits it to reduce the level of public spending or the level of tax revenue to below 30 per cent of GDP. This is too low and prevents us from making the necessary investment in services.</P>
      <P>I do not believe income or other tax reductions can or should continue indefinitely into the future. We tax so we can spend money on maintaining and improving the services on which to a greater or lesser extent we all depend. There are plenty of reasons to reduce tax and in the past there were even more. We look to increasing the incentive to work, to facilitate social partnership and to put more money in people's pockets. However, we should only reduce the tax take and our capacity to spend money on services if we are happy with the state of our public services. We are getting close to the point where we must make a choice on this in real terms.</P>
      <P>This provokes the central question of whether we are happy with the state of our public services. Are we happy that waiting lists are as long now as they have been in several decades? Are we happy that many pensioners must pay £20 or more just to see a general practitioner? Are we happy that children often must wait several years for orthodontic treatment? Are we satisfied that services for people with disabilities are still provided largely on a voluntary basis? Are we satisfied that people suffering from mental handicap get the sort of deal from the State which as citizens they are entitled to expect? Are we happy that the care of the elderly and the sick so often falls on volunteers, often family members, who get little enough recognition or financial assistance from the State? I do not think we are happy &ndash; certainly my party is not happy and neither are the people I speak to on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not cod ourselves. Not all these deficiencies can be solved simply by waving a cheque &ndash; they cannot all be resolved by money alone. However, very little can be done without money, investment and putting aside the resources of the State for services. There must <Col N="542" /> be a political willingness to make available the resources which will give us, for example, a health service which matches the new found wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>In this context the findings of last week's opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> were instructive, if hardly conclusive, in that they challenge the notion that people care only about the money in their pockets or, to be politically correct, their purses. The poll found that 49 per cent of people identified improved services as their first priority while only half that figure &ndash; 24 per cent &ndash; supported tax cuts as their first priority. The message becomes clearer if one takes note of the fact that a further 15 per cent identified the need to invest in the infrastructure of the State as their first priority. I do not think I can put it much better than Denis Coghlan when he commented on the poll that &ldquo;Charlie McCreevy has no excuses for not opening the purse strings for social spending&rdquo;. We will have an opportunity in a few days to find out whether the Minister has taken that advice.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that current spending increases should be limited to the rate of increase in GNP, currently running at 7 per cent to 8 per cent, or the rate of increase in tax revenues, whichever is higher. I am not saying that we must spend to the ceiling but that that is the prudent ceiling under which we should operate. There is also a case for some corrective catch up to make up for underfunding in recent years.</P>
    <P>There will be an opportunity to debate this at greater length next week when the National Plan is published, but we also believe that capital spending should rise at a quicker rate than appears to be proposed in the National Plan. This can be done without recourse to borrowing even for capital purposes. The Minister is accustomed to attending meetings at European level. I attend meetings of the social democratic spokespersons on finance, most of whom have the advantage of being in government at present. One of the buzz phrases, which the Minister has no doubt encountered, is the so called golden rule under which a country borrows only for capital purposes. That is the criterion to which most of our colleagues in Europe adhere. It is extraordinary to think that it is possible to spend more on current and capital spending and still not resort to borrowing. The Minister might tease out the figures but I assure him that it is the case.</P>
    <P>I concentrated most of my contribution on the need to spend more on services. To hold a debate on budgetary strategy which focuses exclusively on taxation is to miss the point. However, I will make a few points about tax. Last year the Government went a long way to introducing a system of tax credits. I complimented the Minister at the time; it was a good and right decision. The Minister said then and has said again this evening that he will seek to complete the process this year. I expect him to do that.</P>
    <P>However, it is worth remembering why this has been done. I believe the Minister is on record as <Col N="543" /> having said that the main reason for shifting to tax credits is to provide a framework for equitable changes in taxation into the future. Tax credits are fairer in that one can, if one chooses, give the same benefit to all taxpayers and therefore a proportionately greater benefit to those on lower incomes without having to tinker with the system in a way which nobody understands. In that context, it is surprising, almost perverse, that so much of the focus of debate over recent months has been on rates and bands. It is almost as if last year had not happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it reflects on people's lack of understanding of tax credits. It is incumbent on all Members of the House to educate commentators about tax credits.</P>
      <P>We should be examining the level of credit. The Labour Party believes that in the next budgetary year we should seek to increase the credit by approximately £500 for each taxpayer. That is £10 per week for a single person and double that amount for a married person with a spouse who is not working. On the face of it, the system should be simple and easily understood. That increase would have the effect of taking many people out of the income tax net. It also reflects the type of deal that will be necessary if there is to be a successor agreement to Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>In future years, we need to consider if credits should be refundable. The Minister will be familiar with the argument for basic income. Once we reach a situation, such as that outlined by Deputy Noonan, where people on the minimum wage are not paying income tax, we should then consider, if we are still in the mode of reducing tax, if people should be refunded because many of them at that stage will not benefit from an increase in the tax credit. I am not arguing that we can afford to do that this or next year but, in the context of where the taxation system is going, if we are in a position within the next five years to make income tax changes and reductions, we should consider making a payment to people by way of a refundable tax credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On some of the points raised by Deputy Noonan, I am concerned about the proposal for an intermediate rate of 35 per cent. If such a rate is introduced, only approximately 5 per cent of income taxpayers will continue to pay at the 46 per cent rate. That would significantly impact on the progressivity of the system and that would bother me. Deputy Noonan cast the proposal largely in labour market terms. He offered the example of Dell and spoke about encouraging <Col N="544" /> people on higher incomes to come back to Ireland. He mentioned an income of between £40,000 and £50,000 and twice that for married people as relevant to such people.</P>
    <P>I am not persuaded that people in those income groups are not coming back to Ireland because of the tax system. If one asks, one will find that issues such as housing are probably more important than tax. Indeed, tax as a disincentive to work or to work more or to immigrate is becoming less important. It is not unimportant but has become progressively less important in recent years. I agree with the Minister that if one wished to introduce a third rate of tax, an introductory rate of perhaps 10 per cent on the first £3,000 of taxable income would be more attractive. My focus would be on that level of income tax payment rather than on the higher rate.</P>
    <P>We tax in order to spend and we spend in order to maintain and improve services. Tax, therefore, is not entirely driven by labour market considerations. Taxes are not, at this stage, the primary issue in the labour market. For the 2.5 per cent of people who are still long-term unemployed, for example, it is probably more important to deal with the disincentives at the lower end of the scale, the point where social welfare and the taxation system come together. In fairness to all parties in the House, significant progress has been made on the integration of taxation and social welfare in recent years. That is where the focus should be in seeking to deal with labour market issues.</P>
    <P>We must also deal with the issue of upskilling and ensuring that people will be available to take up the jobs which companies such as Dell offer. Three to five years ago that would not have been a problem. The skilled labour force was available and it was a major consideration for multinational corporations when locating in Ireland. It must be clear in our education and labour market policies that we are seeking to maintain that comparative advantage. There are indications that we are losing it so there must be significant focus on it.</P>
    <P>On capital acquisitions tax, I sense that the Minister is sharpening his knife for dealing with capital acquisitions, be it gift or inheritance tax. Inasmuch as the Minister seeks to relieve the burden on people, whatever their relationship to the deceased, who are living in a domestic dwelling and did so for some time before the owner of the house died, he will find sympathy, assistance and support from this side of the House. However, if he is seeking, as he did with capital gains tax, to take a firm knife to the concept of capital taxes and inheritance tax, he will not get our support. The relief must be carefully targeted and if it is, it will be supported. If the Minister seeks to destroy capital acquisitions tax, as he did with capital gains tax, he will not receive the support of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> I understand why the Fine Gael Party pitched the debate in this way. It is seeking to appeal to the self interest of as many people as possible and, given how it has done so, it can hardly go wrong. Rather than seeking to reduce tax by a large measure for a few people or even by a little for many people, it has gone for the easy option of reducing tax by a large measure for many people. On the face of it, it must be a sure fire recipe for success, except that the debate on this is moving on and it should move on.</P>
    <P>There is still some scope for tax reductions. We should not be debating how we can put more money into our individual back pockets but how we can create a society and a level of public services that would make us individually and collectively better off.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been a bad ten days for the system of law of order here. We have had a daring armed bank raid at Dublin Airport, the £100,000 taken is still missing and the criminal gang is still at large. In a high profile drugs case the jury took very little time to realise that they did not believe the Garda evidence and the case collapsed. The State has had to pay substantial damages for the wrongful arrest of a totally innocent Sligo man accused of stealing a wallet and the taxpayer, who has to pay the piper, has still not been told the cost of the tune. The Government was slammed for its failure to reply for more than 16 months, to queries from the Swedish authorities in a massive money laundering case. There was a second bank raid at the AIB in Finglas. On Thursday morning last, we learned of the tragic suicide of a 23 year old at Wheatfield Prison. On Friday, news bulletins inform us that the new women's prison opened by the Minister several weeks ago had still not accommodated a single prisoner. The same bulletins confirm that the £26 million Clover Hill Remand Prison, officially opened amid fanfare and photocalls by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 1 June, has still not come into service five and a half months later because the electronic doors, the sprinkling system and the computer security system are not working, the fire alarms send off false alarms, the hazardous floor surface has still not been replaced and the electrical wiring is dangerous. On Saturday morning we woke up to be told that a business manager, who is five months pregnant, <Col N="546" /> and her husband were kidnapped at 9.10 p.m. the previous evening by four armed and masked men at their home in Booterstown. They were held captive overnight. At 7.15 a.m. on Saturday morning the woman was taken by car to the Continental and American Express office at Nassau Street and ordered to open the safe. Meanwhile two of the gang members forced her husband to lie down in the back of his car while they drive around for 40 minutes. The woman was left at her office and told to stay there under threat that if she alerted anybody, her husband would be harmed. The raiders made good their escape with half a million pounds and like the Dublin Airport saga, the money and men are missing.</P>
    <P>When I raised the Dublin Airport raid in the House this night week, the Minister was largely dismissive of his role and that of the Garda. He said it was essentially a matter for Aer Rianta and airport security. When I pointed out that the annual Garda report for 1998 revealed 61 armed raids that year, the Minister produced the 1994 figures to try to show that the position had improved. When I reminded him that the figures for the first six months of this year had hit a record 92 armed robberies, he assured us that everything was under control. Yet three days later we had a double kidnap and another successful bank robbery. I will not mention the shameful debacle at the refugee centre yesterday and today, but the incredible litany of blunders &ndash; administrative blunders and security breaches &ndash; over a ten day period reads like a ten day extract from the annals of some banana republic. Unfortunately, it is by no means an exception or an exaggeration.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no problem in criminals securing guns. There is every evidence that redundant paramilitaries are on the move again. The Garda acknowledged they were tipped off &ndash; that a series of armed robberies have been planned. We are into a major cycle of armed raids on banks and institutions. We are also into a wave of gangland murders. Guns were used without hesitation in a series of drug related revenge killings.</P>
    <P>Last week I called on the Minister to initiate a thorough security review, first by the Garda and second by the banks, who have a clear obligation to devise whatever measures are necessary to make their premises and multimillion pound operations more secure.</P>
    <P>We are facing a major security crisis. Why has the Minister allowed the situation to get out of control? Why are robberies and raids being carried out with such ease and impunity? The performance of a Minister for justice is gauged by the manner in which he or she ensures that law, order and the security of the State and its citizens are preserved. The Minister is not only not measuring up to this yardstick, but seems oblivious to his failure to do so. In the circumstances, the <Col N="547" /> Taoiseach should show zero tolerance for him and appoint somebody who can do the job effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who is unavoidably absent for this debate, fully shares the concern expressed here and elsewhere about this armed raid. He has been assured by the Garda Commissioner that no effort is being spared by the force in its investigation of this serious crime.</P>
      <P>From a report prepared by the Garda authorities, I have learned the facts of the robbery. At approximately 9 p.m. on Friday, 5 November 1999, two men, one of whom was armed, forced their way into the home of the bank official and her husband. The official was questioned about her work at the exchange, specifically about the opening up procedure, the alarm system and the safe.</P>
      <P>After being held all night, both parties were taken from their home at around 7.15 a.m. the following morning. The husband of the bank official was driven around the city in his car, while two other intruders drove the bank official to Dawson Street, where she was forced to open the office, turn off the alarm and open the safe. The safe contained traveller's cheques and Irish and foreign currency to a value of approximately £435,000. The official was told to remain on the premises until she received a phone call at which time her husband would be released. It is believed that up to four raiders were involved in this crime, all wearing wigs and disguises. The intensive Garda investigation into this crime is continuing and the Commissioner has assured the Minister this is not being hampered by a lack of resources.</P>
      <P>With regard to crime trends in general, the House will be aware that the number of armed robberies and armed aggravated burglaries have shown a strong and sustained decrease in recent years. The latest published Garda statistics for these offences indicate that in 1998 there were 69 per cent fewer armed crimes reported than in 1994, and the detection rate had improved from 27 per cent to 40 per cent over that time. While the Minister is concerned with the upward trend in the armed raids this year, the present level is still well below that of 1996. As the Minister told the House last week, armed raids on banks, in particular, are, thankfully, rare. During 1996, 36 armed raids on banks were recorded, ten in 1997 and 31 in 1998. As Members will recall, this type of crime has fallen dramatically over the past decade or so during which armed bank robberies were a common occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The false imprisonment of individuals during the commission of a crime is an appalling assault <Col N="548" /> on their rights and the Minister remains resolute in his determination to ensure that this type of crime is tackled effectively.</P>
    <P>Given the understandable and justifiable concern caused by armed crime, it is reassuring to note that 1998 was a very successful year with regard to Garda seizures of firearms. A total of 850 such weapons were seized last year compared to 580 in 1997. I am sure the House will recognise this is a significant factor in reducing the level of armed crime. The Minister remains in constant contact with the Garda authorities and he fully supports the force in the measures it has in place to deal with this type of crime. He has also indicated to the Garda Commissioner that he will not be found wanting in responding to any reasonable requests for additional resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes me to take this opportunity to request banks and other financial institutions to review their security arrangements so as to minimise the possiblity of such crimes being committed. In the run-up to Christmas with the inevitable increase in cash in circulation, this is all the more urgent. The Minister can also assure the House that appropriate Garda resources are being deployed during this period to monitor this type of activity and, where possible, to reduce the incidence of crime.</P>

        <b>:</b> It is important that the public continues to use the train service. I have spent 20 years travelling from Carlow to Dublin, but it is now a chore to do so because of the increased volume of traffic. The rail track from Dublin to Carlow has continuous welded rail and the new electrified signalling system, which is in operation as far as Athy, will soon be extended to Carlow.</P>
      <P>Carlow town is expanding and there has been a huge growth in housing. People come from Dublin to buy houses there. It is important that a fast train service is provided so that people can get to their destination as quickly as possible. I ask the Minister to ensure that the Arrow service is extended to Carlow to help people to get to and from Dublin more quickly and to encourage them to stay off the roads so that accidents do not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and Deputy Browne for giving me the opportunity to discuss this important matter. The <Col N="549" /> need for the extension of the Arrow service to include Carlow and Athy cannot be over-emphasised. One has only to travel on the N9 or N7 any day of the week to see the frightening increase in traffic which has led to many accidents.</P>
      <P>Athy is expanding and is an obvious place for young couples to purchase their homes. House prices are still reasonable and offer excellent value to the purchaser. However, this obvious advantage will be negated if linkages with the capital's road network cannot be negotiated in a reasonable time. South Kildare must not be isolated. Every effort must be made to include, rather than exclude, this area along the Carlow inter-rail network.</P>
      <P>In a recent speech to the Clondalkin Chamber of Commerce, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise stated that the Heuston to Portlaoise line will be considered for inclusion in the national development plan. I ask the Minister of State to extend this proposal to include the line from Heuston to Kildare, Athy and Carlow. This would have major implications for the south Kildare and Carlow areas. It would ensure that the Kildare development plan, which advocates developing south Kildare, and the Athy development plan, which complements the ideals of that plan, would reach their goals.</P>
      <P>Athy has a high level of unemployment. The extension of the Arrow service on this line would help to solve this problem. The Minister of State's proposals for a four line arrangement between Hazelhatch and Sallins is a first step towards achieving our ambitions for a proposed extension. However, I ask the Minister not to bypass Athy and Carlow when final decisions are made based on the consultants review of the Dublin suburban rail network which, as the Minister of State said, may have implications for the proposals on the Kildare line.</P>
      <P>This proposal will have a major impact if it is achieved. It will permit the towns and their catchment areas to develop both residentially and industrially to match other areas within the capital's catchment area. It will also reduce the number of vehicles on the N9 and N7, thus clearing the many problems traffic is creating for those motorways and the towns on them. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the extension of the Arrow service to Carlow and Athy is one of the strategic review's top priorities.</P>

    <P>This Government fully appreciates the social and economic importance of public transport services and is committed to creating the conditions for the provision of the best possible public transport services throughout the country. Substantial funding for railway renewal has been provided <Col N="550" /> under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999, assisted by EU Structural and Cohesion Funds and, from this year, by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Government approved the implementation of a £430 million railway safety programme for 1999 to 2003. The Dublin to Waterford line is benefiting significantly from this investment. The rail track from Dublin to Kilkenny has been renewed with continuous welded rail, with the assistance of Cohesion and Structural Funds. Additional EU and Exchequer resources were provided as part of the Luas reallocation to complete this work. I assure the House that this commitment by the Government to investment in our railway services will be continued under the forthcoming national development plan. This plan will set out a comprehensive strategy and investment programme for public transport in 2000 to 2006.</P>
    <P>In addition to developing the mainline services, the need to improve and extend the outer suburban services has been identified. This was clearly recognised in the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area which were launched earlier this year by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. These guidelines made it clear that the greater Dublin area comprises not only Dublin city but also extends to the adjoining counties. Addressing future public transport needs requires us to take account of the evolving journey to work patterns in this wider area. The guidelines stressed that the future spatial development of the greater Dublin area must be based around public transport.</P>
    <P>This extended outlook is reflected in the changed emphasis within the work of the Dublin Transportation Office. While the original DTI strategy focused on the city centre, the DTO Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-2006 recognises that there is now a need to focus as well on the needs of other urban centres. Their development proposals include the hinterland area development centres identified in the guidelines, including the town of Athy.</P>
    <P>This broader scope is also being taken into account by Iarnród Éireann which, on the instructions of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has commissioned the consultants, Ove Arup, to undertake a strategic review of the development of the Dublin suburban rail network in the longer term. The consultants have been asked to look at all possible options for the development of the suburban rail network in the greater Dublin area up to 2020. These options include the provision or enhancement of rail services to the development centres identified by the strategic planning guidelines. The feasibility and costing work should be completed by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> As regards improvements on the Arrow line, the DTO's Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-2006 includes proposals to increase track capacity on this route. This proposal involves doubling the existing two track line between Hazelhatch and Sallins and providing associated signalling. In addition, it proposes bringing the Heuston to Connolly line, <i>via </i>the Phoenix Park tunnel, into operation. The estimated cost is £28 million, comprising £18 million for the Kildare line works and £10 million for the Heuston to Connolly section. The final details of this project will take account of the findings of the Ove Arup study.</P>
    <P>The DTO's Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-2006 also identified the need for additional rolling stock to meet increased passenger demand and recommended the phased purchase of 58 additional diesel railcars. A proportion of these will be allocated to the Arrow service and will help to increase capacity. While good progress is being made in improving the railways, these improvements need to be continuously built on so that the best possible rail service can be provided for the travelling public, including the people of Athy and Carlow.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - City Status for Sligo.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.</P>
      <P>A city is described as a cathedral town and a seat of local government. However, there appears to be no formal mechanism or rationale for the determination of a city. While the Government will probably say Sligo can call itself a city, an official declaration by the Government to declare Sligo the millennium city will confer an official status on it.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;city&rdquo; has a certain meaning for investors. It assumes a level of service and status and it becomes a place towards which the investment world reacts favourably. Sligo is placed strategically as a growth centre in the north-west corridor. In the interests of sustainable development, a vibrant Sligo must be part of any Government strategy for balanced regional and national growth. A decision of this nature would not require a special strategy. Sligo exerts a sphere of influence throughout a radius of 80 miles and is already an established regional service centre. Geographically, Sligo is already a recognised gateway and ESRI reports have stated that this status should be recognised and affirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long-term sustainability of the whole western region is at stake. How can areas like south Sligo, north Roscommon, north Mayo, south Donegal and Leitrim expect to attract investment or gain from employment spin-offs unless they can co-exist within a region serviced by a major growth node? Mobile international investment <Col N="552" /> will only locate in major growth centres where a combination of services is available, particularly hospital and educational services and retail and other amenities. These can only be provided to an acceptable level within a growth centre.</P>
    <P>The current regionalisation of the country, prompted by the EU, provides a whole new context for development and planning where success will be judged on a regional basis. The performance of regions which dominated discussions in advance of the new national development plan will come under increased scrutiny with the creation of regional assemblies and regional programme monitoring committees. Success in creating greater regional balance will depend on the extent to which Departments and agencies of the State are able to focus their policies accurately on the needs of each region and county.</P>
    <P>The requirement for a town to be called a city is that it be a seat of government or a cathedral town. Sligo is sometimes called a town and sometimes a city. This leads to confusion and the region falls between both stools. An official declaration of Sligo as a millennium city would have major significance for the entire area. The word city has a certain meaning for investors. It presumes a certain level of services and a status towards which the world reacts very favourably. The Fitzpatrick report established Sligo as a future growth centre. Even officials of Sligo Corporation are confused because in certain instances Sligo is called a town and in others a city. Recognition by Government that Sligo is a city would have considerable benefits for the whole region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Perry for raising this matter. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>In local government terminology Sligo is a borough under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act, 1840. Prior to that its corporation was titled as the Provost, Free Burgesses and Commonalty of the borough of Sligo. At the most recent census the population of the borough is recorded at about 17,800 with environs at about 700 which together represent about one third of the total population of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under current local government law the term county borough applies to the areas of the five centres which are commonly regarded as cities &ndash; Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford with populations ranging from about 42,000 to almost half a million. Each has its own local authority with a city council and an organisational, financial and staffing structure entirely separate from that of its county and is responsible for the full range of local authority services. For reasons of effectiveness and cost there are no proposals to create any additional such local authorities &ndash;<Col N="553" /> which in effect would mean the division of an existing local government county.</P>
    <P>Terms in everyday use such as city, town, village or hamlet often reflect local history, tradition and usage rather than formal legal status, definition or distinction. Also for census purposes a range of territorial divisions and terms are used. Indeed, local practice has been that in the case of at least one urban centre &ndash; Kilkenny, which is not a county borough &ndash; the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; has for historical reasons been in use locally for many years.</P>
    <P>A major local government Bill is currently being drafted which will, <i>inter alia,</i> provide a modern legislative basis for our local government system with modern terminology of meaning to the public. While it is not intended that this would interfere with current practices and tradition neither will it create additional county borough type authorities. The objective is to publish the Bill early in the new year and this will provide Deputies with ample opportunity to consider the whole question of local govenment terminology.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - High Court Case.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased, sir, that you have given me the opportunity to raise this matter. The Minister of State will remember that the case involved a stonemason from the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Perry, who was wrongly arrested and falsely imprisoned for an alleged larceny when he found and reported as lost a wallet containing cash. This striking example of zero tolerance reflects an attitude on the part of the State which refuses to accept that a mistake may have been made. This blind refusal to settle a case until the matter opened before the High Court following a two year legal battle warrants a detailed explanation on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>This case has remarkable similarities with the treatment of Emerald Meats by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development which was outlined on national television last week and which led to an early curtain being drawn over Dáil proceedings last Thursday. We see public officials in both cases across a range of offices taking breathtaking liberties with public money. If civil servants in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development had been digging into their own pockets to fund the action in the Emerald Meats case it would have been settled a long time ago. Similarly if the Garda, officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister had been providing money from their own resources the Sligo case would not have proceeded to court but would have been disposed of long before the two years had elapsed between the issuing of proceedings and the settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was the settlement on the part of the State arranged with or without an admission of liabilty <Col N="554" /> on the part of the State? I want details of public money expended or promised, including the question of costs. How much taxpayers' money is at stake in this case? The public and this House are entitled to know the full extent of the settlement as the money used to facilitate it is public property. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the ultimate responsibilty to taxpayers for the spending of money in his Department.</P>
    <P>Why was the State exposed to this liability and who is responsible? Has the Minister sought a full report from the Garda Commissioner on the matter? There is a need for a full and detailed explanation of this issue, setting out in clear and unambiguous terms why the case was not settled earlier and who refused this wronged man an apology. Who in the Garda Síochána made these decisions and why? Why did the Garda Commissioner, the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General or the Minister not intervene to ensure an early settlement of the issues involved? All these people appear to be so arrogant that a simple act of apology was refused on numerous occasions. The victim, who was treated like a criminal for three years states that the stress arising from this treatment was damaging to his health and adversely affected his well-being. I accept this.</P>
    <P>The victim made it quite clear that he had no interest in compensation. This good Samaritan merely wished to have his good name restored. He was merely performing a civic duty in attempting to locate the person who lost the cash in the first place.</P>
    <P>We need to learn lessons from this case as to the manner in which taxpayers' money is expended and to ensure that citizens are not exposed to such torment as was the victim in this case. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Refom owes our citizens an explanation and he owes the victim a public apology. I hope the explanation and the apology will be forthcoming without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this matter. Claims for compensation against the State arising from the alleged actions of members of the Garda Síochána would normally fall to be dealt with by the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda. The cost of any awards or settlements, etc., is met from subhead 1 of the Garda Vote.</P>
      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy is, I presume, that of Mr. Martin Cadden and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Ireland and the Attorney General. The State was represented by senior counsel, nominated by the Attorney General and instructed by the Chief State Solicitor. This is the standard practice for cases of this type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> The matter came before the High Court and during the course of the proceedings, the parties arrived at a settlement. The terms of the settlement were recommended by counsel.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 44 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural development regulation which was adopted by the Agriculture Council on May 17 this year as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement provides for continued support for early retire<Col N="558" /> ment from farming. I welcome the fact that, unlike the 1992 regulation under which the existing early retirement scheme was drawn up, the new regulation does not require a transferee to enlarge the holding which is taken over. I have been conscious that the existing requirement has proved onerous in many cases. The new regulation instead includes a viability clause applicable to the transferred holding. It also requires the transferee to practise farming on the transferred holding, but unlike the 1992 regulation it does not specifically state that he or she must do so as a main occupation.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present preparing an integrated rural development plan with a view to implementing the new regulation, and the terms and conditions which will apply to the future early retirement scheme are being considered in the context of that plan. I expect my Department's proposals for the integrated rural development plan to be submitted to the European Commission before the end of the year. The Commission is required to approve the plan within six months of the date of submission.</P>
    <P>In so far as processing of current early retirement grant applications is concerned the position is that the number of applications varies from one area to another. Factors such as human resources and other pressing demands on the relevant staff can result in variations in processing time, though every effort is made to ensure that all applications are dealt with in a timely manner.</P>
    <P>There are 39 RDE inspectors, located throughout the country, involved in the processing of early retirement applications, together with seven regional inspectors. In addition to this work, these officials are also involved in the processing of REPS and young farmer installation aid applications, along with the Leader programme. The steady growth in the number of applicants for the early retirement scheme and these other measures since their introduction, while it is most welcome and indicates their attractiveness to the farming community, has placed significant burdens on the resources available. With regard to the early retirement scheme, my Department is keeping its procedures and the allocation of its resources under review with a view to minimising unnecessary delays.</P>
    <P>While my Department seeks to minimise delays in processing applications under the scheme, it has taken steps to ensure that such delays do not result in a financial loss to retiring farmers. The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 52 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Under the current WTO agreement and other international agreements, concessions have been given to 14 third countries which permit the import of specific quotas of sheepmeat into the European Union, at zero or reduced rates of tariff. In practice, it is rare for exporting countries to fully utilise their quotas.</P>
      <P>The bulk of imports into the EU under the WTO agreement come from New Zealand which has a quota access of 226,700 tonnes. I accept that these imports can create difficulties on the EC market and both I and my French colleague have maintained pressure at EU level to limit the effects. Immediately following the 1995 WTO agreement, the European Union sought and secured a unilateral agreement with New Zealand, in the form of a gentleman's agreement, that imports from New Zealand would not disturb the EU markets. This arrangement has proved an effective instrument, but has not of course eliminated the overall effect of imports on the EU market. Following complaints from EU countries, the New Zealand meat authorities have agreed to moderate their trade initiatives in the face of particular difficulties on a number of occasions, most notably in the early months of this year when the UK market was undergoing particularly difficult conditions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the sheep forum, the specific objectives which I set for the sheepmeat forum were to evaluate the future direction of the sheepmeat sector and to assess how the industry can address existing constraints and future challenges.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made cover four broad areas including marketing, the production of quality lamb, improved efficiency at farm level and the policy changes needed at EU level in order to remove certain inequities in the operation of the ewe premium scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as marketing is concerned, the forum recommended that promotion activities should <Col N="560" /> focus both on the home and export market and should seek to identify Ireland as a source of quality lamb reared in a clean and natural environment. The forum also recommended that payment for lamb should be more clearly linked to quality and that the EUROP classification grid should be used to grade carcases at all processing plants. The introduction of a sheep traceability programme was also recommended as the basis for a future lamb quality assurance scheme. The forum also identified several areas for improvements in the more efficient production of sheep, in particular, in breeding and cost reduction. On EU policy, the forum identified a number of deficiencies in the current support regime and recommended changes to be made in order to provide better income support for Irish sheep producers, including the introduction of an extensification premium for sheep. The forum looked also at the impact of the import of New Zealand lamb on the EU market and recommended a number of ways to limit the effects of this on Irish export markets.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the recommendations is part of an ongoing process that has already commenced and my Department will be working in partnership with all interests including the producers, processors and State agencies to secure their successful implementations.</P>
    <P>With regard to imports of lamb into Ireland, published CSO statistics show that 1,699 tonnes of sheepmeat were imported into Ireland in 1998. This comprises trade with EU member states and third countries. The single non-EU supplier is New Zealand, which exported approx 720 tonnes into Ireland under the WTO Agreement. This consisted of frozen product, mainly boneless mutton and boneless lamb cuts. Lamb imported from other member states is fresh product, mainly in carcass form.</P>
    <P>Although domestic demand accounts for only 25 per cent of Ireland's lamb trade, I attach considerable importance to effective promotion on the home market. An Bord Bia operates market development and promotional programmes, tailored to the various seasons of the domestic market, in which the quality and attractiveness of home produced lamb is highlighted. An Bord Bia has recently competed a round of advertising for lamb in the national press in order to increase domestic consumption of lamb generally. There was also a further campaign for the promotion of mountain lamb focusing on the catering sector, particularly in premium restaurants where mountain lamb is produced.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia will continue to keep the promotion of lamb under review.</P>

These arrangements require applicants entering REPS from that date to give an undertaking that their contracts-plans would be integrated and adapted to the new arrangements for REPS to be agreed under the rural development plan and programmes 2000-06. My Department has no option but to comply with the requirements of the commission in this area.</P>
      <P>The original arrangements required that all plans which had not been accepted by 30 July must be accompanied by the undertaking outlined above. However, further negotiations with the European Commission have lead to an agreement that all acceptable plans lodged before 31 July 1999 can be processed under the terms and conditions of the existing scheme.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 79 and 87 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pig sector not alone in Ireland, but throughout the EU, has been going through a very difficult time over the past year or so due to oversupply of the international market. Although prices paid to pig producers here have increased <Col N="562" /> significantly since the beginning of the year, there is clearly a need for further improvement.</P>
    <P>Despite the introduction of generous export refunds, an APS scheme, and a food-aid programme for Russia for the sector, the recovery in the market is taking longer than had been anticipated. I have recently written to EU Commissioner Fischler, requesting an increase in the export refunds for Russia, and an early completion of the food-aid programme under which a further 50,000 tonnes of pigmeat is set for delivery. I also asked him to bring forward proposals aimed at supply control in the sector, a factor which seems essential, if the industry is to prosper.</P>
    <P>On the home front, I have arranged to meet the banks and representatives of the compound feed industry this week to discuss developments in the pig sector.</P>
    <P>Last week, I met Enterprise Ireland and An Bord Bia and have asked both organisations to examine what action they can take to assist the sector. With regard to my meeting with Enterprise Ireland I have asked them for an immediate assessment of slaughtering capacity and to examine aspects of the industry which may require attention and possible investment.</P>
    <P>In 1998, pigmeat imports into Ireland amounted to 35,000 tonnes. About 63 per cent of the pigmeat imports are used in the retail sector, with the balance going to the catering sector.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia recently commissioned research to establish the level of import penetration for pigmeat within the food service sector. The results showed that while home-produced pigmeat compares very well generally with imported product on grounds of quality, taste and freshness, nevertheless imports are perceived to have some advantages such as price, consistency of quality and of supply and larger eye muscle in the case of imported bacon. However a high proportion of current suppliers to caterers would, according to the research like to increase sales to that sector, but the caterers feel that a number of improvements are needed from suppliers in the areas of deliveries, product range, and more attention to customer needs. These are issues which the industry needs to address.</P>
    <P>Consumption on the domestic market is highly important, particularly given the level of penetration by imports. An Bord Bia recently launched its autumn campaign for quality assured bacon and I am confident that this campaign will generate increased consumption of home produced pigmeat which should help prices.</P>
    <P>The outlook for pig prices is favourable. The forecast by the EU Commission is that the supply of pigs should drop in the last quarter of this year. In addition the increased demand during the Christmas period should help to strengthen prices for producers.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, being taken by his Department to facilitate an increase of income on small and medium sized farms, having regard to the figures published by Teagasc in July 1999 showing that 80,000 farms earn under £10,000 per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Teagasc figures referred to relate to income from farming activities only. When discussing farm incomes it is important to note that, on average, approximately half of farm household income now comes from farming activities. The dependence of farm households on farming income has reduced in recent years as off-farm employment has increased. This trend is likely to continue in the future, and is welcome in the sense that it provides a valuable alternative source of income for farm families.</P>
      <P>The main source of information on total farm household income is the household budget survey. The results of the survey in 1994/95, which are the latest published results, show that average farm household income compared reasonably well with those of urban households and exceeded that of other rural households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures produced for the national anti-poverty strategy show that the risk of farm households being in poverty has in fact decreased substantially in recent years. In 1997, 13 per cent of farm households were at risk of poverty, compared to 20 per cent in 1994, and 33 per cent in 1987. This <Col N="564" /> trend is very welcome. Farmers in fact now have a much lower risk of being in poverty than the population in general.</P>
    <P>In order to assist particularly vulnerable farm households, the Government introduced the new farm assist scheme in the 1999 budget. To date, more than 6,800 farmers receive payments under the new scheme and decisions are pending in more than 400 further cases. More than 1,000 other farmers continue to receive payments under the previous smallholders assistance scheme and these claimants will be transferred, where appropriate, to the new scheme over the coming months. I am confident this scheme will significantly improve the incomes of farm families most in need.</P>

      <P>CSO figures show that there were an estimated 227,900 farms in 1975 and 146,300 in 1998. These are the nearest years for which data is available to those requested.</P>
      <P>There are no official projections of farm numbers in the future. The technology foresight report, published by Forfás, suggested that there might be 100,000 to 110,000 farms by 2015.</P>
      <P>The decline in farm numbers is an international phenomenon, and the decline has been more rapid in several other EU member states over the same period. Recent trends in this country show that the decline in farm numbers is almost entirely confined to farms below 20 hectares in size. The current economic prosperity has brought considerable benefits to farmers, through low interest rates, and the improved availability of off farm jobs which supplement farm income. But there are also new pressures as young farmers are offered new and lucrative job options away from the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> The Government favours the retention on the land of the maximum number of farm families that is practicable. This policy is clearly reflected in the very high levels of public support provided to the sector. More than £1 billion in direct payments to farmers, some £500 million in market support measures and £400 million in other measures and administration was provided in 1998. This expenditure amounted to approximately £13,000 per farm on average in one year. In addition the farm assist scheme was launched last year and is now providing enhanced levels of support to farm families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future I have appointed a committee of experts to develop a strategy for the development of the agrifood sector over the next decade. I expect to receive their report early in the New Year. I intend to carefully examine the proposals of this committee to ensure that the policies we pursue provide not just short-term support but contribute to the long-term viability of the greatest possible number of farm households.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Legal proceedings, which were initiated by a limited number of plaintiffs in 1990, are still before the high court following judgments given in their favour in the Supreme Court in 1997. These proceedings relate to the assessment of damages in respect of seven plaintiffs involved in the Duff case and some 100 other plaintiffs involved in associated cases.</P>
      <P>During the course of these proceedings my Department presented information to the court on the number of participants in the farm modernisation scheme and in the rescue package during the early 1980s. This information was based on ACOT and Teagasc surveys on the number of participants in these schemes who were following dairying plans during the period in question.</P>
      <P>It was estimated that some 13,000 farmers participating in the farm modernisation scheme were following dairying development plans and that 11,000 of these had not achieved their milk production targets by the end of 1983. There were a further 3,000 persons with dairying investment plans involved in the rescue package at that stage. My Department also calculated that the difference between these producers' end-of-plan targets and their initial quota allocation amounted to approximately 87 million gallons.</P>
      <P>I have made no special provisions in respect of any persons or group of persons who are not party to the proceedings in the Duff case and other associated cases. I have received legal advice to the effect that any proceedings that may be initiated by such persons are barred by the passage of time. Therefore the estimate being sought by the Deputy does not arise.</P>
      <P>It would not, in any case, be possible to make any meaningful estimate in relation to quota or compensation given the individual nature of these cases.</P>

      <P>Samples of the cans referred to in the Deputy's question were analysed by the State Laboratory at the request of my Department. The analysis shows that the cans contain a total meat content of 46.6 per cent by weight. The laboratory has indicated that because of the method of preparation of this product which involves high pressure and temperature treatment it is not possible for it to determine which type of meat is predominant in the sample nor can it reliably determine the percentage meat by species in this cooked product. While there are other methodologies which can be used in the analysis of heat treated meat products, studies have shown that they cannot be reliably applied to the detection of bovine material in such products.</P>
      <P>As to the question of water content in canned meat, additional water beyond that added in the initial process normally arises in the subsequent analysis of the final cooked product. This is due to the presence of water in the individual ingredients used, in particular the meat and fat ingredients.</P>
      <P>The company has advised my Department that this product was produced for export to Russia. The production records presented to my Department in the context of its investigation into this matter indicate that in the period 1993-95 production exceeded the quantity that was actually exported to Russia. The company has also informed my Department that the cans located in Clondalkin were part of the production not exported to Russia.</P>
      <P>Export refunds were paid to this company in the years 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 in respect of canned beef and pork products exported to Russia.</P>
      <P>The inspections carried out by staff at my Department prior to and during the course of production of the canned product are those provided for under national food safety legislation, the objective of which is to ensure that the product is safe to eat. The product in question was produced in conformity with the relevant food safety requirements. Regulation of matters relating to the labelling, presentation, and advertising of food stuffs are primarily a matter for the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>

      <P>Imports of poultry meat have become a significant feature of the industry and I understand price attractiveness is an important consideration. My preference is that the industry should use native raw material to the greatest degree possible but it is the case that a considerable quantity of these imports are processed into finished meal products, and re-exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> The Irish poultry industry is expected to expand production and demand is forecast to increase also.</P>
    <P>Poultry products are imported from other member states of the European Union and from third countries. Subject to the exporters preferred transport system, product may be exported direct to Ireland or through another member state.</P>
    <P>The importation of meat products is governed by the European Union (EU) harmonised rules. The main conditions for imports into Ireland are: advance notification to my Department of each consignment; the goods must be accompanied by veterinary certification or, in certain cases, a commercial document; the goods must come from an approved establishment, e.g. slaughterhouse, cutting plant or cold-store which has been approved by the EU Commission; and the goods may be subject to inspection by officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>Imports of poultry meat products are selected for sampling on a regular basis to monitor the health status of the product. Under arrangements agreed between the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and my Department, 1,200 samples of imported poultry meat will be tested to check for the presence of illegal residues. It must be borne in mind, however, that particular imports cannot be specifically targeted for monitoring as Ireland, being a member of the European Union, is obliged under EU legislation to allow the free circulation of legally imported goods within the EU. Goods detected as not being in compliance with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and if necessary destroyed.</P>

      <P>There has been a long-running dispute between the EU and the US arising from the Union's ban on imports of hormone treated beef, which was imposed in 1988. Following protracted proceedings, which included an appeal under the WTO mechanisms, the EU was allowed up to 13 May last to bring the import ban fully into line with WTO rules on risk assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from its efforts to comply fully with the WTO requirements, at the beginning of May 1999, the EU released the results available thus far of seventeen scientific studies into the six hormones in question. The EU maintains that these initial scientific results have provided evidence of a possible risk to consumer health from hormone treated meat and that its continued import ban is <Col N="570" /> therefore justified.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Emerald Meats case concerns entitlements to licences for the import of beef into the EU under special arrangements in 1990.</P>
      <P>As far as damages are concerned, the High Court awarded Emerald Meats economic damages of more than £400,000 in respect of profits foregone by the company as a result of the Department's decision. This amount was paid in full and without delay by the Department to Emerald Meats in 1992.</P>
      <P>As far as the legal costs of Emerald Meats are concerned, the courts ruled that these costs should be shared between my Department and the meat processors. These have been paid to Emerald Meats. The legal costs deemed appropriate to my Department amounted to approximately £342,000. In line with the ruling of the court, my Department has recovered all of the meat processors' share of the legal costs with the exception of £9,600. I have asked the Chief State Solicitor's office to commence legal proceedings to secure payment of the outstanding amount.</P>
      <P>In its March 1997 decision, the supreme court gave leave to Emerald Meats to seek general damages and referred this issue back to the High Court for determination. There is no agreement on the amount of general damages due to Emerald Meats. While Emerald Meats have offered to settle the case for £7.5 million in a short half page letter to the Chief State Solicitor's office in January 1998, the company has not submitted a substantiated Statement of Claim. My Department has been advised both by the CSSO and legal counsel that it should only consider offers for settlement based on a substantiated Statement of Claim. This remains the position. As far as the claim itself is concerned, it has not been substantiated despite the lapse of two and half years since the judgment of the Supreme Court in March 1997. This claim also has to be seen in the context where the rights to the licences were fully restored to Emerald Meats from 1991onwards and for which the company was fully compensated in 1992 for the only year in which it was without the licences in dispute, that is 1990. There has also been the suggestion that, with added interest, the claim could now amount to substantially more. I am advised by the Office of the Attorney General that the award of interest is not automatic in this situation and any consideration of this could only take place in the context of a substantiated Statement of Claim and even then it would be at the discretion of the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a statement which I issued last week, I outlined my Department's response to the allegations made against my Department in relation to this matter. The Department's decision in 1990 was based on its interpretation of the regulations and after consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. It should be emphasised that while the courts found against my Department, they did not find that there was any collusion between my Department and the meat processors <Col N="572" /> to deprive Emerald Meats of its entitlements under the GATT quota scheme. My Department unreservedly accepts the rulings of the courts and has fully implemented their findings.</P>
    <P>While the courts found against my Department, all the decisions in this case were taken on the basis of legal advice. The costs and damages awarded against my Department have been promptly paid to Emerald Meats. The case will continue to be handled in accordance with legal advice and normal legal procedures. I want to make it clear that I do not wish to prolong this case but obviously I can only consider any settlement on the basis of a substantiated Statement of Claim.</P>
    <P>The decision on the Emerald Meats case was taken almost ten years ago and in the interim there have been major changes in the operations and procedures of the Department. Major initiatives have been taken over the past decade and substantial progress has been made in eliminating the scope for the kinds of error which occurred, and in ensuring that there is no departure from high standards. The CAP reform of 1992 switched the emphasis of Community support from market supports &ndash; notably export refunds and intervention, which is in progressive decline &ndash; to direct income support to individual farmers. The Department's handling of this major undertaking has been an acknowledged success. Its performance in delivery of these income support payments is among the best in Europe.</P>
    <P>Strong financial control and audit procedures have been introduced in recent years. The Department is now certified annually by an independent auditing firm as paying agency of the Commission by complying with the rigorous requirements of the FEOGA Accreditation process. The reach and capacity of the Department's IT services have been vastly extended. An upgraded internal audit unit was established in 1994. An audit committee headed by an external accountant was also established in 1994 to advise management.</P>
    <P>The approach to controlling meat plants has been transformed. There is now greater reliance on unannounced inspections which were first introduced in 1991. Special control teams have been set up and chains of command have been clarified. My Department has introduced a system of fair procedures and a customer complaints unit, which deals with a weakness identified by the Emerald case. A modernisation programme has been under way for some years encompassing major improvements in the financial control environment and service culture of the organisation.</P>
    <P>The Department recognises how difficult this matter has been for Emerald Meats. It was not a comfortable time for the Department either. I know that everybody concerned in the Department, as well as the shareholder in Emerald Meats of course, acted in good faith throughout, notwithstanding the suggestions that have been made to the contrary. The handling of this case <Col N="573" /> has been reviewed internally in the Department and it is clear that there were shortcomings in the Department's management of the scheme concerned, by way of lack of administrative care and failure to afford the company fair procedures in dealing with its applications and representations. This was a unique situation, which I do not want to happen again, and it would therefore be unwise to argue from the particular in this case to the Department in general.</P>
    <P>There have been substantive changes in the Department over the past decade, the nature and the type of schemes have changed dramatically and irrespective of whether we like it, we have to position ourselves to deal with the serious issues and challenges facing agriculture over the next decade.</P>

The participants have the option of extending their contract for a further year or of terminating their participation in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999, which comes into effect on 1 January 2000, sets out the criteria to be met in agri-environment programmes for which support shall be granted. Under the regulation agri-environment programmes shall support an environmentally favourable extensification of farming and management of low intensity pasture systems. Generous levels of compensation will be available to farmers who agree to farm in accordance with these requirements. In many cases this will require farmers to move to more extensive systems.</P>
      <P>Proposals for a revised REP scheme are being prepared by my Department for submission to the EU Commission. I expect that the revised scheme will prove attractive to farmers and that the participation rate will increase significantly above the current level of 43,000 farmers.</P>

      <P>The general terms and conditions of the national beef assurance scheme are contained in the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Oireachtas. In particular, the Bill provides a legal basis for the introduction of a mandatory system of application by and inspection, approval and registration of all persons involved in the primary production and processing of cattle and beef, including farmers. The precise details of this aspect of the scheme will be finalised when the legislation is in place.</P>
      <P>I emphasise, however, that the broad outlines of the scheme have been discussed in great detail with the representative trade organisations, including the farming organisations, and they are fully aware of the proposed conditions of the scheme. In addition, I want to give assurances that, when the legislation is being implemented, a comprehensive information and advice programme will be conducted in conjunction with Teagasc and the industry to ensure that all participants are fully aware of their obligations under this aspect of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The other element of the national beef assurance scheme, the introduction of a comprehensive animal tracing system, is already being implemented and farmers have been notifying details of private sales of cattle for the past year. The maintenance of the herd register is of course an important element of cattle traceability. To facilitate owners to meet their obligations, a consolidated herd register and animal remedies book was supplied to all herdowners free of charge earlier this year. The book contains clear instructions as to how records must be kept. In addition, I have been made arrangements with Teagasc to conduct a nationwide training campaign on cattle traceability and the herd register. Some 200 training sessions will be held throughout the country covering all aspects of tagging, registration, identification and cattle movement and monitoring. Teagasc has also produced an explanatory guide for herdowners to the herd register and cattle traceability requirements. I am confident that these measures will ensure that all farmers are fully informed of their obligations in relation to these matters.</P>

      <P>The beef task force which I established last November submitted its report to me last June. This report sets out a strategic plan for the beef industry covering the complete range of activity from production through to marketing. To deliver this plan the task force also agreed a series of recommendations, the implementation of which are the responsibility for all interested parties involved in the beef industry, and including the relevant State agencies. I have set up a monitoring committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Tom O'Dwyer to progress implementation on the recommendations relating to the pilot promotion scheme, the introduction of a price transparency mechanism, graded pricing, mechanical classification and a code of practice.</P>
      <P>There has been substantial progress on the pilot promotion programme. Considerable progress has also been made on the development of a price transparency mechanism and a special meeting of the monitoring committee has been arranged for 25 November to finalise this. The mechanical carcase classification trial has been completed and it is expected that the results will be available early next year.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive evaluation of the REP scheme was submitted to the European Commission in July 1999. Submissions were received from concerned organisations including the Heritage Council, Birdwatch Ireland, Teagasc and the farming organisations. Independent studies were commissioned on particular measures of the REP scheme under the auspices of Teagasc and the universities. Independent consultants were engaged to consider the various inputs to the evaluation process and to put together the comprehensive and objective assessment of REPS.</P>
      <P>This evaluation assessed how the objectives of the scheme have been met, examined the agricultural, socio-economic and environmental impact of the REP scheme and provided practical recommendations for future modifications and improvements to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> Participants in REPS are required to follow a nutrient management plan which identifies pollution control facilities on the farm and ensures the efficient use of nutrients in an environmentally friendly manner and sets limits on application rates of fertilisers. The evaluation report found that nutrient management plans are contributing significantly to the REP scheme objective of reducing agriculture's contribution to environmental problems.</P>
    <P>The control of farm pollution scheme was specifically examined by my Department's analysis and evaluation unit which was set up under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99. The examination took place as part of an evaluation of the environmental effects of the OPARDF, which was completed in August of this year. This evaluation made a number of recommendations regarding improved farmyard pollution control which are presently being considered by my Department in the context of the schemes being drawn under the National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of the year, my Department has approved four additional dedicated cattle ships and a roll-on/roll-off vessel for the carriage of livestock. All of the dedicated ships have been approved for transporting cattle to the continent while two are approved for markets further afield such as the Lebanon. The extra roll-on/roll-off vessel operates between Cork and France. This brings the total number of dedicated ships approved for the export of cattle to 17 and gives a capacity on such vessels of over 23,000 head of cattle at 500 Kg weight. In addition, there is the capacity for up to 72 livestock units to be carried each week on three roll-on/roll-off vessels currently operating out of Rosslare and Cork.</P>
      <P>There has been a further dramatic surge in cattle exports this year, with total exports to 24 October 1999, amounting to 337,265 compared with 126,286 in the same period last year &ndash; a 167 per cent increase. Exports to the continent to 24 October 1999, amount to 277,511 compared with 103,453 in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to respond without delay to all reasonable requests for inspection to vessels to ensure that there is sufficient capacity available to meet demand.</P>

      <P>Having considered various options and having consulted all of the interested parties, I decided that a cut off date for entry into milk production seemed the most equitable and practical way of targeting the particular category in question. The date chosen is that on which the quota regime in its present form entered into force.</P>
      <P>When EU approval is received my Department will put in place a scheme for the allocation of that quota. At that stage, final details of the scheme will be published and application forms will be available from my Department and from milk purchasers.</P>

      <P>A total amount of £130 million is expected to be paid to sheep producers in EU premia and headage payments in 1999.</P>
      <P>According to the Teagasc farm management survey, EU direct payments in 1998 accounted for 94 per cent of the family farm income on holdings where sheep production was the main enterprise. These figures highlight the need for sheep producers to obtain a higher proportion of their income from the market. The report of the sheep forum, which was presented to me recently, outlined a number of recommendations aimed at securing higher returns from the market. My Department will be working closely with the industry and State agencies to ensure the implementation of these recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Following the introduction of the TB eradication scheme, the incidence of bovine tuberculosis was reduced significantly by the mid-1960s However, persistent difficulties have been encountered in achieving further sustained reductions below the levels reached at that time. At the same time some 99.5 per cent of cattle are free of TB and the regime in place facilitates the continued trading of livestock and livestock products to the EU and third countries.</P>
      <P>There is general acceptance of the role of the badger in the spread of bovine tuberculosis and a growing body of scientific evidence supports this opinion. In particular, the use of strain typing techniques has identified the same strain of mycobacterium bovis in cattle and badgers in the same locality.</P>
      <P>The only valid test currently available for tuberculosis in badgers is a full and extensive post-mortem. To fully research the role of badgers in the spread of bovine TB, my Department, under licences approved by the wildlife service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, removes a small percentage of the badger population each year. These licences are operated in project areas and at individual farm level in order to research specific outbreaks of disease.</P>
      <P>Of the badgers removed from the special project areas, in parts of Donegal, Kilkenny, Cork North and Monaghan, which were initiated in 1997, 24 per cent of those removed in 1998 had confirmed tuberculosis. One of the purposes of this removal is to establish the actual level of infection in a representative sample of the badger population. The removal exercises involved in gathering this data are now largely completed in the project areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date this year, almost £633 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU headage and premium schemes of which some £381 million relates to payments made under the 1999 schemes. In the past week alone almost £124 million has been paid. I would like to point out that under the <Col N="582" /> suckler cow and special beef premium schemes, payments totalling £112 million were made to farmers on 1 November 1999. My Department has succeeded in paying the highest ever number of farmers on the first day on which EU regulations permit payments to be made. Payments under all of the schemes are in line with the targets set out in the Charter of Rights for Farmers. Payments under the 1999 deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme commenced on 4 March 1999 &ndash; payments under that scheme are made within 60 days of application  &ndash; and 99 per cent of all applicants have been paid some £14 million to date.</P>
      <P>The first and second instalments of the 1999 ewe premium scheme have been paid to over 97 per cent of applicants.</P>
      <P>Payments under the disadvantaged areas headage schemes commenced in September last. Payments amounting to almost £16 million have been made to 80 per cent of sheep headage applicants, while some £80 million has been paid to 82 per cent of cattle headage/beef cow applicants. Payments under these schemes will continue to be made on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Payment of the 60 per cent advances under the 1999 special beef premium commenced on 1 November 1999 in line with EU regulations. To date over £51 million has been paid in respect of 83 per cent of January to July applications. At this time last year only 68 per cent of January to July 1998 applications had been paid.</P>
      <P>Likewise, payment of the 60 per cent advances under the suckler cow premium scheme also commenced on 1 November 1999 and so far some £65 million has been paid to 81 per cent of May 1999 applicants. The position last year was that only 72 per cent of May 1998 applicants were paid at this time.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 1999 arable aid scheme commenced on 18 October 1999 &ndash; the earliest possible date on which payments could commence. Including oilseeds advances, a total of £79 million has now been paid to 96 per cent of all applicants. The position at this time last year was that £74 million had been paid under the 1998 arable aid scheme to only 90 per cent of applicants.</P>
      <P>As regards the 1999 extensification premium scheme, payments are due to commence in the period April to June 2000. The October 1999 suckler cow premium applicants will not have completed their six month retention period until the end of April 2000, therefore payments under this scheme cannot commence until after that date.</P>
      <P>According to the CSO's figures for 1998, the last year for which full data is available, direct income payments accounted for 56 per cent of aggregate farm income. The contribution that these payments make to farm incomes is not yet available for 1999, as the first estimate of agricultural output, input and income is not due to be released by the CSO until early December.</P>

      <P>It is mandatory for participants in the rural environment protection scheme to follow a nutrient management plan on the entire area of the holding. The measure identifies pollution control facilities on the farm, determining whether they are adequate and specifying additional facilities if required. The measure aims to promote efficient use of nutrients in an environmentally friendly manner, to balance nutrients available and required on the farm and sets limits on application rates. The mean level of chemical nitrogen applied per livestock unit on REP scheme farms in 1997 was 17 per cent lower than in 1994 and usage of chemical phosphorous reduced by 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>The evaluation report on the REP scheme submitted to the European Commission in July 1999 found that nutrient management plans are contributing significantly to the REP scheme objective of reducing agriculture's contribution to the environmental problems of nutrification.</P>

      <P>The recently submitted report of the sheepmeat forum recommended that a voluntary lamb quality assurance scheme, in line with similar schemes in other meat sectors, should be put in place.

      <P>To date this year almost £633 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU headage and premium schemes of which some £381 million relates to payments made under the 1999 schemes. In the past week alone almost £124 million has been paid. I would like to point out that under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes, payments totalling £112 million were made to farmers on 1 November 1999.  In fact, my Department has succeeded in paying the highest ever number of farmers on the first day on which EU regulations permit payments to be made. Payments under all of the schemes are in line with the targets set out in the charter of rights for farmers.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 1999 deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme commenced on 4 March 1999  &ndash; payments under that scheme are made within 60 days of application &ndash; and 99 per cent of all applicants have been paid some £14 million to date. The first and second instalments of the 1999 ewe premium scheme, have been paid to over 97 per cent of applicants.</P>
      <P>Payments under the disadvantaged areas headage schemes commenced in September last. Payments amounting to almost £16 million have been made to 80 per cent of sheep headage applicants while some £80 million has been paid to 82 per cent of cattle headage/beef cow applicants. Payments under these schemes will continue to be made on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Payment of the 60 per cent advances under the 1999 special beef premium commenced on 1 November 1999 in line with EU regulations. To date over £51 million has been paid in respect of 83 per cent of January to July applications. At this time last year 68 per cent of January to July 1998 applications had been paid. Likewise, payment of the 60 per cent advances under the suckler cow premium scheme also commenced on 1 November 1999 and so far some £65 million has been paid to 81 per cent of May 1999 applicants. The position last year was that 72 per cent of May 1998 applicants were paid at this time.</P>

    <P>Payments under the 1999 arable aid scheme commenced on 18 October 1999 &ndash; the earliest <Col N="586" /> possible date on which payments could commence.

      <P>The scheme of installation aid which operated under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99 was suspended on 7 August 1997. All valid applications received in my Department prior to that date were processed for payment. However, it was subsequently decided that applicants whose applications were held in the offices of Teagasc or private planners on 7 August 1997, and who were ineligible to apply under the national installation aid scheme introduced last year, could be accepted for assessment under the earlier scheme provided they met the eligibility requirements of the scheme on 7 August 1997. Such applications had to have <Col N="587" /> attained the same level of completeness as the applications which had been received in my Department at the time of the suspension of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The critical conditions which had to be met to enable these applications be accepted for examination were the application form must have been signed and dated before the scheme was suspended; an application to have the herd number transferred into the name of the applicant must have been made prior to the suspension of the scheme; and either the deed transferring the land or the lease agreement of lands taken over by the applicant must have been stamped by the Revenue Commissioners and lodged for registration in the Land Registry, where applicable, by 7 August 1997.</P>
      <P>All the requirements I have outlined were set out in the scheme document and the operational guidelines for the scheme which were available to all applicants and agricultural consultants. I am satisfied that my Department has made every effort to ensure that all eligible applicants were accommodated under the 1994-97 scheme.</P>

      <P>Under the European Communities (Fresh Poultrymeat) Regulations 1996, S.I. No. 3 of 1996, official veterinarians and other authorised officers of my Department are empowered to carry out inspection procedures which are designed to ensure that Irish poultry products comply fully with all hygiene requirements. These procedures include daily supervision of plant hygiene, and ante and post mortem inspections. All poultry carcasses are inspected following slaughter, and any carcasses and viscera deemed unfit as a result of the inspections are condemned and removed from the food chain.</P>
      <P>Under Council Directive 96/23, as transposed by the Control of Animal Remedies and their Residues Regulations 1998, a residue plan, which is approved by the European Commission, is in place and this provides for sampling at slaughter plant level in the poultry sector.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's case, the annual number of samples provided for under this plan is as follows: broilers &ndash;  552; turkeys &ndash; 200; hens &ndash; 200; and ducks 36. In addition, under a programme, operated in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, an additional 3,700 poultry samples will be tested for inhibitory substances, as well as for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also carries out microbiological testing of poultry and egg products. Under <Col N="588" /> the European Communities (Fresh Poultrymeat) Regulations 1996, S.I. No. 3 of 1996, tests for salmonella were carried out on over 2,000 samples of fresh poultry carcasses during 1998. During 1999 to date tests for listeria have been carried out on 300 samples of cooked poultry product. Testing for campylobacter has recently commenced. In addition, pasteurised egg products are also tested for salmonella under the European Communities (Egg Products Regulations 1991) S.I. No. 293 of 1991. These tests provide further assurance to Irish consumers of the quality and safety of Irish poultry products.</P>

A further 13 were deemed ineligible as the applicants failed to meet the qualifying conditions under the scheme. There are 497 applications currently being processed by my Department.</P>
      <P>Applications are processed in order of receipt as speedily as possible and I am satisfied there are no inordinate delays being experienced by applicants.

Fifteen mill<Col N="589" /> ion gallons will be made available to producers with quotas below 55,000 gallons who meet certain criteria. The criteria include a requirement that that they must have produced 90 per cent of their quota in two out of the three quota years 1995-98, that they have not sold or leased quota with land during the period in question, that they have not temporarily leased quota in more than one year during the period and that they have acquired quota on a permanent or temporary basis during the same period. Five million gallons will be made available to a special scheme for younger active producers who have commenced milk production since 1993. Criteria to apply to this category will also include the 90 per cent quota usage level as well as those related to the purchase and leasing of quota. Additional criteria in this category will include an age limit of 35 at the date of commencement of milk production, educational qualifications and a maximum quota after allocation of 35,000 gallons. The maximum allocation to producers in this category will be 5,000 gallons. The balance of 500,000 gallons will be set aside for special cases arising out of the operation of the general distribution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 94 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement of the Government's decision to establish an inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, officials from my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which would have a role in facilitating implementation of the decision we arrived at, met representatives of the group Justice for the Forgotten on 9 October and again on 14 October. At the 14 October meeting, the representatives for the group asked that a period of four weeks be allowed where no action would be taken to set the process for establishing the inquiry in train, to allow the group to make a further submission on the nature of the inquiry to be established and the legal-technical issues involved. The Government considered this request subsequently and agreed to it. A submission is awaited from the group.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government called for a public inquiry into Bloody Sunday after the publication of a very detailed assessment of the new material in relation to Bloody Sunday and the Widgery Tribunal. In the Pat Finucane case, British Irish Rights Watch had prepared a very detailed submission on that case. In the cases of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and Seamus Ludlow, no such detailed assessments have been made.</P>

      <P>An application for a work permit on behalf of the individual concerned was received by my Department on 5 August and refused on 27 August 1999 because the individual concerned was then in this country on a short-term student authorisation under which she was obliged to return to her country of origin when it expired. This precluded the issuing of a long-term work permit on her behalf at that point.</P>
      <P>I would, however, point out that under arrangements recently agreed between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, non-nationals who have been given permission to remain in this country by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because they are married to Irish nationals, no longer require to hold work permits to work in this country.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>With effect from 6 April 1991, the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, extended to regular part-time employees, on a modified basis, the benefits of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973. Under the 1991 Act, regular part-time employees were defined as those who were in the continuous employment of the employer for not less than 13 weeks and who were normally expected to work not less than eight hours a week and who, but for this legislation, would not have an entitlement to annual leave. Such employees were entitled to paid leave at the rate of six hours for every 100 hours worked, and proportionately less where fewer hours were worked. All part-time employees also became entitled to public holidays on the same basis as full-time employees.</P>
      <P>With effect from 30 September 1997 certain sections of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, which repeals the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, and section 4 of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time) Employees Act, 1991, became law. In their stead, the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, now provides legally enforceable entitlements for all employees to both annual leave and public holidays. In the case, however, of part-time-casual employees, it is necessary that they should have worked at least 40 hours in the five weeks ending on the day before the public holiday in order to qualify for public holiday benefit.</P>

      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety, it is the primary duty of every individual employer to identify, assess and manage the health and safety needs of his or her own business.</P>
      <P>The administration, enforcement and promotion of occupational health and safety legislation is a day-to-day matter for the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health  &ndash; Health and Safety Authority &ndash; which is the statutory body charged with overall responsibility in this area. The authority works to a targeted annual work programme, which is approved by its tripartite management board, and covers all employment sectors, focusing on priority sectors with high accident rates.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the authority continuously monitors the levels of workplace injuries and fatalities to ensure that the most appropriate policies and practices are in place to assist employers and employees provide a safe and healthy workplace for our rapidly expanding workforce.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the appendices to the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the community employment programme published in October 1998. The first three appendices give a profile of the participants, supervisors and sponsors surveyed by the consultants. In addition to consultations with primary stakeholders, the opinions of FÁS, Department of Finance, other interest groups and my Department were also considered by Deloitte &amp; Touche before finalising the report.</P>
      <P>The participants surveyed are outlined in Appendix I. This survey is based on 218 respondents. Their age, education, the region they are from, the type of project they are involved in and their opinions of the programme are set out in detail in this appendix. Appendix II gives an outline of the supervisors surveyed. Details are supplied under the main headings: Personal Details, Project Information, CE Programme and Supervisors' Development Programme. The survey is based on 100 supervisors from the ten FÁS regions. The sponsors surveyed are included in Appendix III under the headings: project information and CE Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 49 sponsors returned questionnaires, the majority being from the voluntary and com<Col N="605" /> munity pillar. The ten FÁS regions were represented.</P>

      <P>Following the restructuring of the community employment programme last July, there were requests from ICTU and the INOU for clarification of the Government decision. In this regard I met with ICTU at the end of September and IMPACT, the union representing the majority of supervisors, was present. During this meeting the difficulties faced by supervisors due to the scaling down of the number of participants on the CE programme were raised by the IMPACT representative. Following on from this meeting Department officials met IMPACT and supervisor representatives with a view to establishing the full extent of the concerns being raised by the supervisors. A further meeting is scheduled to take place this month between the IMPACT representative, FÁS and departmental officials with a view to progressing the matter further.</P>

      <P>The EMPLOYMENT Initiative, of which NOW is a strand, has been operating since 1995 and will continue until end of 1999-early 2000. A payment of £6,064 has recently issued to the project in relation to its 1998 final claim.</P>
      <P>Projects have been paid their first advance &ndash; 50 per cent &ndash; of their 1999 allocation. In order to apply for the second tranche of funding, an expenditure threshold of 25 per cent of the programme's allocation for 1999 had to be reached. The required level of expenditure was reached by the end of July and a claim was made to the European Commission early in August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a tranche of funds for the EMPLOYMENT Initiative was received from the European Commission on 29 October and is currently being processed, the amount of European Social Funds received was not sufficient to meet all outstanding project claims. However, I expect that a <Col N="606" /> further payment will be made to the project in the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>My Department has made a further claim to the European Commission for the outstanding amounts and I would like to assure the Deputy that as soon as further advances are received, payments will issue promptly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of any additional ro-ro freight and passenger terminal facilities along the east coast is a matter for the port authority in the first instance. I have not received any proposals for such a development from Arklow harbour commissioners, nor has any interest been expressed to my Department by the private sector and in particular, shipping companies. Such dedicated facilities must of course be demand driven and not simply displace existing capacity at the major ro-ro and passenger seaports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="607" /> As the Deputy may be aware, I recently published a major independent review of the State's 16 commercial regional ports and harbours, which includes Arklow Port.</P>
    <P>The review develops a general strategic framework for the ports and harbours concerned which aims to maximise their financial sustainability, their contribution to strategic maritime policy objectives and socio-economic impacts.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the report I initiated a full consultative process. While I am aware that the consultants met and took on board the views of relevant interests, including those of the port authorities and management and other interested State, tourism and local commercial development bodies, I believe that it is essential that all stakeholders and interests are given an opportunity to comment on the recommendations which emerged from the review in advance of any decisions being made.</P>
    <P>On conclusion of the consultative process, I will be bringing fully costed and developed proposals to Government for consideration including determinations on the most appropriate and beneficial operational-management structures for each regional port.</P>
    <P>The recommendation in the review in relation to Arklow is that the harbour commissioners be offered the opportunity to make a case for themselves to become a commercial State company. The commissioners have been requested to make such a case and present a plan showing how they can cater for the requirements of corporatisation.</P>
    <P>A key recommendation of the regional ports study is that all newly constituted ports should prepare some form of integrated development plan involving consultation, which will bring together aspects of economic, social, physical and environmental development policies that will direct the future of the port.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> On foot of a request from Arklow harbour commissioners which I received last week, I have approved funding up to a maximum of £20,000 to assist the commissioners in the preparation of a fully integrated development plan. All future development possibilities including the facilities mentioned by the Deputy can be considered in that context and in particular the financial viability and sustainability of such developments.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources if his attention has been drawn to the fact that it has been alleged that no fishery protection officers are working to protect salmon on the Shannon and Mulcair rivers at Limerick and that salmon moving up to their spawning beds are very vulnerable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The fisheries in question are in the possession of the Electricity Supply Board which is responsible under the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1935, for their management and protection. The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board is responsible for promoting and encouraging the protection of the fisheries in its fisheries region which are not directly in its possession or care.</P>
      <P>I am aware that concerns have been expressed by the Shannon board about current levels of protection in place for these fisheries. In light of these concerns, my Department is to request a report from the ESB on its present and future plans to ensure that salmon stocks in the lower Shannon are adequately protected. I will communicate further with the Deputy on receipt of this report.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources the progress being made by his Department to develop a strategy for the environmental regulation of petroleum exploration and production for offshore oil and gas activities; the measures, if any, he will take to allow for public consultation during the development process beyond the consultation taking place with industry representatives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that there are already measures in place to ensure that all operations relating to offshore oil and gas exploration and production are conducted with due regard to the protection of the environment, in accordance with agreed national and international standards and procedures. Approvals for drilling, surveying and production operations are issued by my Department, and are subject to conditions relating to the protection of the marine environment.</P>
      <P>In addition to these provisions, the Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1999, enacts the Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention, OPRC, 1990, which was adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, IMO. Under the Act, the Irish marine emergency service, IMES, may require the preparation of advance emergency plans to deal with pollution incidents. The Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act, 1996, requires a permit for the disposal at sea of offshore installations, and provides for public consultation. The Act gives effect to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic.</P>
      <P>These measures are set out in the licensing terms for offshore oil and gas exploration and development and in the rules and procedures for offshore petroleum exploration and production operations. In addition, an operation is required to have prepared an oil spill emergency response plan where drilling operations are being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions relating to the protection of the environment are being re-examined in the context of the revision of the rules and procedures manual and will be revised as considered necessary. On the question of public consultation in these matters the position is that the rules and procedures relate to very specialised activities and, apart from the petroleum industry active in Ireland, public consultation is not considered practical at this stage. However, under the Pet<Col N="615" /> roleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, a company which proposes to bring petroleum into production is required to submit to me an environmental impact statement on the likely effects of the proposed development on the environment and make it publicly available. Any person is entitled to make submissions or observations to me in relation to the effects of the proposal on the environment. I would of course take into account any such observations before reaching a decision on the proposed development.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources the progress being made by his Department in developing the regulatory framework for development of petroleum exploration and production for offshore oil and gas activity which forms part of his Department's Strategy Statement 1998-2000; the proposed status of any such guidelines or regulations; the measures, if any, he will take to allow for public consultation during the development process; and the timetable for their implementation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference in my Department's Strategy Statement l998-2000 to an updated E and P regulation framework relates to rules and procedures for offshore petroleum exploration operations, and rules and procedures for offshore petroleum production operations, which are issued by my Department to petroleum companies engaged in such activities.</P>
      <P>The updating of the rules and procedures involves consultation with other Government Departments and agencies with responsibilities in these areas. Consultation on exploration activities is under way and when completed will be followed by consultation on production. An essential component of the updating process is to ensure that appropriate safety regulations are in place. In this regard my Department has engaged consultants to carry out a review of the offshore safety systems in use. This consultancy has commenced and a report with conclusions and recommendations is expected by next spring. It is expected that the updating process in respect of both sets of rules and procedures will be completed by the middle of 2000.</P>
      <P>The rules and procedures for offshore petroleum exploration and production operations are drawn up by me under powers that derive from the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960. They are incorporated in authorisations which I am empowered to issue under the Act. Accordingly, holders of exploration licences or petroleum leases for development activities are obliged to comply with all of the provisions of the rules and procedures in the conduct of their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of public consultation in these matters the position is that the rules and procedures relate to very specialised activities and <Col N="616" /> accordingly, apart from the petroleum industry active in Ireland, public consultation does not arise.</P>

      <Quest>if he has made any protest regarding the Russian attacks on columns of Chechen refugees, one of which resulted in 25 deaths and 70 wounded; if the fact that half the Chechen population have had to flee their homes constitutes ethnic cleansing of the kind which occurred in Kosovo and justified the NATO led war against Yugoslavia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is very seriously concerned at the situation in Chechnya. The loss of civilian life and the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons fleeing the conflict zone is totally unacceptable. Vulnerable elements of the population must be protected.</P>
      <P>The present conflict began with the invasion of Dagestan in August and September by Islamic militants from Chechnya, and by apartment block bombs in Moscow and other Russian cities in September, which claimed almost 300 lives and for which Chechen guerillas were blamed by Russia. Russia has been bombing alleged rebel bases in Chechnya since 5 September, has occupied a security zone covering the northern third of Chechnya, and has crossed the Terek river and encircled the Chechen capital, Grozny.</P>
      <P>An estimated 350,000 Chechen refugees, mostly women and children, have fled the conflict area, some 180,000 going to the neighbouring Russian republic of Ingushetia and also to North Ossetia and Dagestan. There have been numerous reports of Russian attacks on refugee convoys. Ireland and our European Union partners have made clear to the Russian authorities on several occasions, and at the highest level, our view that attacks on civilians and refugees are totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>As regards comparisons with the ethnic cleansing perpetrated in Kosovo, Russia has claimed that its action in Chechnya is not to drive Chechens out of Chechnya, but to prevent any further incursions by Chechen guerillas into other parts of Russia and it is for this reason they state they closed the border with Ingushetia, which prevented Chechens from leaving the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closing of the border with Ingushetia has been a matter of the utmost concern to the Euro<Col N="618" /> pean Union. On 30 October the Finnish Foreign Minister, Ms Tarja Halonen, representing the Presidency of the European Union, visited Ingushetia on a fact-finding humanitarian mission. In her discussions with Russian federal and local authorities, Foreign Minister Halonen emphasised that those seeking to leave the conflict zone should be allowed to do so and the road to Ingushetia should be opened forthwith. She deplored recent accounts of displaced persons being harassed and attacked as they have attempted to flee the conflict. Foreign Minister Halonen also spoke to Foreign Minister Ivanov and stressed the EU's concern at the deteriorating situation in the northern Caucasus, the unacceptable plight of civilians caught up in the conflict zone and the urgent need for efforts to be made towards a political solution.</P>
    <P>On 4 November the EU delivered a démarche to the Russian authorities again calling for the opening of the border to Ingushetia, the removal of administrative obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian assistance and a very early start to negotiations. The border crossing at Kavkaz was re-opened on 4 November and at time of writing more than 3000 refugees are reported to have crossed into Ingushetia.</P>
    <P>The Government fully supports the views expressed to Foreign Minister Ivanov by Foreign Minister Halonen representing the Presidency of the European Union. Together with EU partners the Government is concerned to see an urgent political solution to the situation in Chechnya. I intend to raise the issue at the European Union Council of Ministers in Brussels next Monday.</P>
    <P>The Government fully condemns all acts of terrorism including the bombing attacks in Russian cities. It recognises the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and need for the federal authorities to take measures to deal with terrorism. However, the Government's concerns regarding reports of attacks on civilians  have been made known directly to the Russian authorities, and we will continue to press our view, both directly and through EU contacts, that there can be no military solution to the Chechnya conflict.</P>
    <P>As chairman in the office of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe I have instructed Ireland's Ambassador to the Council to initiate urgent consultations with a view to establishing how best the Council of Europe could assist Russia in efforts to safeguard human rights and promote democracy in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>There can be no military solution in Chechnya and efforts to arrive at a political solution must be given priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the financial and personnel situation facing the interim UN Administration for Kosovo &ndash; UNMIK. I discussed the situation with Dr. Bernard Kouchner, Head of UNMIK, during my visit to Strasbourg last week to assume the Chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. I made it clear to Dr. Kouchner that the Government will do all it can to ensure that UNMIK is properly financed and equipped to perform the critical tasks required of it. Dr. Kouchner informed me of his upcoming visit to New York where he will attempt to secure adequate resources for UNMIK. In my presentation to the Council on Ireland's Presidency programme, I stressed that a very high priority would be given to developing the Council's contribution to the stabilisation of democracy in south east Europe. In Kosovo, this will mean increased pragmatic co-operation with both UNMIK and the OSCE.</P>
      <P>I recall that, under interim financing provisions for UNMIK adopted by the General Assembly on 28 July last, the Secretary-General was authorised to enter into commitments of up to $200 million. The detailed budget outline of approximately $450 million is currently being considered by the UN Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, prior to consideration by the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The EU is hosting a pledging conference for voluntary donations to UNMIK on 17 November in Brussels and UNMIK is preparing a detailed document on funding needs.</P>
      <P>UNMIK is also responsible for policing in Kosovo and over 1,700 civilian police from 39 countries are operational on the ground. UN police units are already responsible for full police functions in the Pristina and Prizren regions. The Secretary-General has recommended that the Security Council increase the strength of the United Nations international civilian police force to 4,700. This increase is intended to ensure that UNMIK has a fully functional international police service both to establish and maintain civil law and order throughout the territory. Clearly it will take some time to build up the numbers of civilian police to the level envisaged by the Secretary-General. While KFOR is the principal component of the international security presence in Kosovo, there is a military liaison unit attached to UNMIK comprising 34 officers and two NCOs. Ireland has contributed two officers and both of the NCOs. In addition, Brigadier General Richard Heaslip of the Defence Forces is on secondment to UNMIK as a district administrator. Ireland is, of course, represented in KFOR by a transport company of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolution 1244 also set out principles which should form the basis of a political settlement in Kosovo. These envisaged substantial self-government for Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Some progress has been made towards implementation of these provisions of <Col N="620" /> the resolution, including the establishment of the Kosovo Transitional Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>International sanctions have been applied by the EU against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia &ndash; FRY &ndash; since the first half of 1998, when the situation in Kosovo began to deteriorate. Similar sanctions have also been applied by the associated countries following the lead given by the EU and by countries such as Switzerland and the United States.</P>
      <P>The following sanctions currently apply to the FRY: a prohibition of government support for export credits and the sale or supply of equipment which might be used for internal repression or terrorism; a freeze on the funds held abroad by the Governments of FRY and Serbia; a freeze of funds and a ban on investment in the FRY; a prohibition on the sale and supply of petrol and petrol products to FRY; a ban on flights between the European Union and the FRY; a ban on the issue of visas for entry to any EU member state to certain named individuals identified with the Belgrade regime or whose activities support President Milosevic.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its EU partners are convinced of the need to maintain sanctions against the FRY as a means of applying pressure on Belgrade to implement necessary democratic reforms internally and contribute to the stability of the region. We are conscious, however, of the need to make it clear that our dispute is not with the Serbian people but with the Government of President Milosevic. We seek to convey this message through support for the democratic opposition, and by means of aid directed at the people of Serbia through such programmes as the energy for democracy scheme. Changes in the sanctions regime are under consideration so as to maintain pressure on members of, and those close to, the Milosevic Government, without causing suffering to the Serbian people as a whole.</P>
      <P>International humanitarian agencies estimate that approximately three million people in Serbia are in need of some humanitarian assistance, of whom 900,000 are in receipt of some form of international aid. There are currently 660,000 refugees within Serbia. These comprise some 160,000 non-ethnic Albanian internally displaced persons, IDPs, from Kosovo and 500,000 refugees from Bosnia and Croatia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UN humanitarian agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and NGOs are currently concentrating on meeting the immediate needs. Ireland, through its membership of the <Col N="621" /> European Union, has contributed to over 56 million euro in humanitarian assistance already provided to the Serbian population. The European Community Humanitarian Office &ndash; ECHO &ndash; has allocated this funding to provide assistance to the most vulnerable groups of the population; the sick, elderly, refugees, displaced people, social cases and social institutions. The Department of Foreign Affairs is actively considering the provision of humanitarian assistance to help relieve the situation of the most vulnerable people there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The concerns of the road transport industry in relation to the proposed Working Time Directive have been conveyed to me by the various industry associations, particularly the Irish Road Haulage Association, IBEC and the Irish Concrete Federation. The issues raised include concerns about possible increased costs, the need for additional vehicles and drivers, and the inclusion of self employed drivers within the scope of the directive. These are being taken into account in determining Ireland's negotiating position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that there are already rules about working time for most workers under Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993. The <Col N="625" /> aim of that directive was &ldquo;to guarantee the protection of workers against the adverse effects on their health and safety arising from excessive working time, insufficient rest or irregular work patterns&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, the directive did not cover sailors, junior doctors or employees in any form of transport. They were left out because it was felt at the time that different rules would be needed for them because of the complexities attached to each occupation.</P>
    <P>The Social Affairs Council has now reached political agreement on rules for sailors, junior doctors and transport workers other than those engaged in road transport.</P>
    <P>In October 1997 the social partners in the road transport sector established a joint committee at Community level to explore how the Working Time Directive could best be adapted taking account of the particular circumstances of their sector.</P>
    <P>On 31 March 1998 the Commission issued a consultation document to the social partners. While sufficient points of convergence were reached by the social partners to draw up the text of a draft joint agreement, they failed to reach agreement by 30 September 1998. The Commission had informed the social partners that, in the absence of agreement by that date, the Commission would come forward with proposals for the sector. This is what it has done.</P>
    <P>This Commission proposal has been debated at length at the Transport Questions Working Group. Many member states have had difficulty with these initial proposals and political agreement has not yet been reached. The Finnish Presidency is continuing the discussion of the commission proposal with the objective of achieving an acceptable compromise package. Ireland's objective in this regard is to negotiate a package which provides flexibility for the industry while protecting the health and safety of workers.</P>
    <P>The driving hours of mobile workers in transport are currently regulated by the tachograph legislation but other activities such as loading and unloading, cleaning the vehicle, performing safety checks on the vehicle and paperwork are not included in the calculation of driving time. In fact, time which may appear to be a break on a tachograph chart could in fact be occupied with other strenuous activity. Although road transport workers are only permitted to drive for 45 hours a week, they may in fact work in excess of this. The health and welfare of these workers is as important as for workers in any other industry.</P>
    <P>In our negotiations, we have already attempted to extend the reference period over which the hours are calculated to 12 months but were vehemently opposed. There are member states who want this period reduced from the existing four month proposal to one month. This directive was discussed at a recent Transport Council meeting but no definitive agreement was reached. It may be listed for further discussion at the Transport Council in December 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> It is recognised that the proposed Working Time Directive may have an impact on the industry. However this has to be balanced with the protection of health and safety of the workforce on which the industry depends.</P>
    <P>I and my Department will remain in regular contact with the various representative associations to ensure that Ireland's negotiating position is informed by their concerns. However, whatever provisions are finally adopted will have to take account of the differing views of member states and the position of the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>The security laws of other countries, including the UK, restricted our ability to send information on the share offer, including registration material, prospectus and mini-prospectus <Col N="627" /> and application forms, into their jurisdictions. This was an issue on which we took extensive legal advice. The procedure we adopted was in line with the practices in other similar European share offers.</P>
      <P>People in other EU countries could, of course, apply for shares provided the funds involved, whether cheque, banker's draft or direct debit, were drawn in Irish pounds or euros on a bank or building society account in Ireland. In the case of the application from the couple referred to by the Deputy, payment was by means of a cheque drawn on a bank outside the jurisdiction and the application was, therefore, rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> In the light of the complexities of the case, I have asked the review group to re-examine the case and to respond directly to the persons concerned in the next few days.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals relating to the introduction of legislation to regulate the gathering and publication of statistics relating to the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, my Department is currently finalising arrangements for the establishment of a mar<Col N="632" /> ket observatory to develop mechanisms to benchmark Ireland's progress and state of readiness in relation to telecommunications in comparison with international standards. This will complement other work being done by the Information Society Commission in relation to benchmarking Ireland's preparedness for the information society. The need for statistics on Internet related matters is one which I will ask to be considered by my Department. It is not clear that the availability of statistics on the Internet is such that the type of regulatory intervention suggested by the Deputy is required.</P>
    <P>As regards connection to the Internet, telephone charges for dial-up Internet access are a matter for licensed public telecommunications operators providing such services. Such operators are obliged to publish information on their standard terms and conditions with regard to access and use of the public telephone network, including tariffs. This requirement is supervised by the Director of Telecommunications regulation.</P>
    <P>The quality of Internet connection between <Col N="633" /> Internet service providers and the Internet are matters for individual Internet service providers themselves.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question on 25 February 1999, I do not consider that operational security matters can appropriately be addressed in the House. The disestablishment of the military police company at Government Buildings was proposed in the Defence Force Review Implementation Plan 1996-98. The Government decided, however, that the proposal be referred to the interdepartmental national security group for further consideration. The matter is currently being considered in the context of a review of security at Government Buildings being conducted by the Garda Síochána which, I understand, is nearing completion.</P>

      <P>The two charges referred to are made payable under two different sections of the Irish Horseracing Industry Act, 1994, as inserted by section 4 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing (Betting Charges and Levies) Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>Section 54B of the Act of 1994, as inserted by the Act of 1999, allows the Irish Horseracing Authority to introduce such flat-rate charges on on-course bookmakers as it considers necessary and appropriate and it is for the authority to decide the amounts payable and the manner in which the payments must be made. I understand that the authority has introduced a charge of £2,000 on each and every on-course bookmaker under this section and has given those bookmakers the option to pay the amount using a direct debit system which was already in existence for the 5% on-course levy that was payable up to last July.</P>
      <P>Section 54E of the Act of 1994, as inserted by the Act of 1999, prescribes that off-course bookmakers must pay to the Revenue Commissioners for and on behalf of the authority by the 1 September each year a charge, in respect of each premises, of £500, £1,000 or £2,000 depending on their level of turnover at the premises up to the previous June. There is no pre-existing direct debit system in operation with the Revenue Commissioners and it was considered that a weekly collection system would be too cumbersome and inefficient especially for the lower rates. Under the legislation the only instalment system that could be used now is one involving advance payments so that the full amount of any liability would be paid by 1 September as prescribed in the Act.</P>

Approval of the EU Commission is necessary before compensation will be paid. It is hoped that the Commission will give the necessary approval by the end of November and once such a decision is received payment will issue as soon as possible. Two further tranches of compensation at reduced levels will be paid.</P>

    <P>It should also be noted that in line with EU regulations, only the first and second instalments of the 1999 ewe premium have been paid as yet.

      <P>The person named declared a forage area of 20.69 hectares on his 1999 area aid application form. However, one of the plots of land declared by him was also included in the application of another herdowner. My Department has contacted both herdowners to clarify the matter and is awaiting a response. In the meantime initial payments in respect of special beef premium issued to him based on a lower forage figure of 12.08 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named also submitted 10.42 hectares of cereals on his 1999 area aid application. Full payment issued to him in respect of this application on 18 October 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named submitted a special beef premium application in respect of 30 animals on <Col N="638" /> 21 April 1999. One animal died on the holding leaving 29 animals eligible for payment. Under EU regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies, based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application form. On the basis of the lower forage area of 12.08 hectares the person named was therefore entitled to payment on a maximum of 24.16 reckonable livestock units.</P>
    <P>Twenty three animals on the special beef premium application each have a livestock value of one livestock unit while the remaining six animals each have a livestock value of 0.6 LU. When the maximum stocking density of 24.16 reckonable livestock units is converted to animals, this allows for a maximum payment of 26.56 premia. A 60% payment totalling £1,364.28 in respect of 26.56 animals issued on 1 November 1999.</P>

The area eligible for payment has, however, been reduced as a result and this has implications for payments already made. My Department will shortly communicate with the applicants directly.</P>

The area determined at inspection was 14.79 hectares. This represents a difference of 9.46 hectares or 63.96%. Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3% and 20% and when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore, in this case, a full 100% penalty must be applied and no area aid related payments can be made.</P>

The terms and conditions which will apply to the future early retirement scheme are being considered in the context of that plan.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for the 1999 ewe premium scheme in respect of 68 ewes.</P>
      <P>His flock was inspected on 4 March 1999 but only 14 of his own sheep were found on his holding. He admitted that a further 54 sheep he presented at inspection did not belong to him.</P>
      <P>As a result of this, he was debarred from participating in the ewe premium scheme for two years, 1999 and 2000, and his ewe premium quota is reduced from 66 to the number of eligible ewes actually found during the inspection, that is, 14.</P>
      <P>He has appealed these decisions to the independent appeals unit who will adjudicate on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Council of Ministers has agreed that compensation will be paid over the next three years to participants in the schemes affected by reductions arising from the introduction of the euro.</P>
      <P>In so far as the scheme of early retirement from farming is concerned, full compensation, with 100% funding by the EU, will be payable for the reduction in 1999 pensions to participants who joined the scheme prior to 1998. Approval of the EU Commission is necessary before compensation will be paid. It is hoped that the Commission will give the necessary approval by the end of November and once such a decision is received, payment will issue as soon as possible. Two further tranches of compensation at reduced levels will be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 to 177, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The use of antibiotics in pigs and poultry is regulated under EU and national legislation. Use for growth promotion purposes, which is provided for under EU Council Directive 70/524, is regulated in Ireland under the European Communities (Additives in Feedingstuffs) Regulations 1989-1997. Therapeutic use of antibiotics in animals is governed at EU level by a body of legislation, in particular, Council Directive 81/851 and Council Regulation 2377/90, which are transposed into Irish legislation by means of the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, and the Control of Animal Remedies and their Residues Regulations, 1998.</P>
      <P>There is a legal obligation on those selling animals for slaughter to ensure they do not contain illegal residues, including illegal residues of antibiotics. My Department operates an extensive national residue monitoring programme, covering all food-producing species and 16 residue groups, which involves testing approximately 100,000 samples, taken at primary processing plants, for illegal residues. The programme for 1999, which more than meets the sampling levels required by the EU legislation and is approved by the European Commission, includes provision for testing 16,000 porcine and 250 poultry samples for the presence of inhibitory substances, using the relevant testing procedure. In addition, under a special programme in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, an additional 3,700 poultry samples are being tested for inhibitory substances over the next 12 months, as well as for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the Western Health Board &ndash; WHB &ndash; study referred to, which relates to a sampling exercise undertaken by that body at retail level and which is outside the scope of my Department's controls. The results of the WHB study were, however, notified to my Department by the board. The Department was very concerned at the picture presented by the WHB figures, which was at variance with that presented by the Department's ongoing monitoring programmes. Over the past two years, the Department's testing programmes have not detected any antibiotic positives in the poultry sector and very low levels of positives, of less than 1% and declining, in the pig sector. In that context and so as to <Col N="648" /> further establish the position at processing level in so far as poultry was concerned, my Department's proper and appropriate response to receipt of the WHB retail test results was to commission special, additional sampling, with the samples being tested at an independent, commercial laboratory. The results confirmed the Department's earlier findings that there was no evidence of an antibiotic residue problem as far as poultry slaughtered in Irish poultry slaughter plants were concerned. As part of its follow-up to receipt of the WHB figures, my Department facilitated exchange of technical information between the laboratories concerned and also participated in a collaborative study organised by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. These exercises have not definitively established the reasons for the differences in results as between the laboratories involved in the testing of the retail samples. It should be said, however, that my Department remains confident of the veracity of its sampling and testing procedures at processing level and will continue to maintain, as it has done for some time, comprehensive monitoring programmes at this level, the results of which are published as a matter of routine.</P>
    <P>Great care must be taken when comparing results of samples sourced at different points of the production, distribution and retail chain and account should be taken of the fact that testing downstream in the chain is by definition more vulnerable to the effects of a greater range of extraneous influences than closer to or at the point of initial processing. It is not, for example, valid to represent the results of testing of retail samples as indicative of a particular situation at processing or production levels unless one has first identified and then eliminated the various possibilities for contamination of samples between the point of processing and when the product is displayed at retail level. Even where this is done, it will be self-evident that it is also necessary at the very outset to establish that all the sampled product was of Irish origin before any valid inferences about the state of the Irish poultry or pig sectors could be drawn from the results of tests carried out on retail samples.</P>

      <P>Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper on Rural Development: Ensuring the Future, which was published in August. The White Paper represents a comprehensive and coherent approach to rural development in Ireland for the foreseeable future. It contains, among other things, a commitment to balanced regional development, including development of a national spatial development strategy. Such legislation, if any, as may be necessary to give effect to the commitments in the White Paper will be brought forward by the appropriate Minister in due course.</P>
      <P>As promised in the White Paper, arrangements for the rural proofing of policies have now been introduced.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to produced prices for the main commodities in the agriculture and food sectors compared to those obtaining generally in other EU member states is as follows:</P>
      <P>Cattle and sheep prices in Ireland are traditionally lower than those in most member states mainly because of the heavy dependence of these sectors on export markets and the additional transport costs arising from our distance from these markets. In addition, there is a natural preference in many member states for domestic product, with the result that imported foods are often discounted. The importance of this factor has been significantly increased in recent years in the beef and sheepmeat sectors because of the March 1996 BSE scare. The various promotion campaigns of Bord Bia are designed to promote Irish beef and lamb on the European market as a quality product which has been produced in a natural environment with a view to securing higher returns.</P>
      <P>In the pigmeat, poultry and egg sectors, prices are determined by market forces operating within the member state concerned. While the operation of this free market may in some cases mean that prices paid to farmers are higher in some other member states, overall this is of benefit to the Irish industries in the long term as it allows the products to compete with the higher priced commodities from elsewhere in the Community.</P>
      <P>Milk prices paid to Irish milk producers compare reasonably well to those prices paid in most member states.</P>

      <P>My Department has approved three organic bodies namely Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust Limited and Demeter Standards Limited to operate the licensing and inspection system for organic producers. The approved bodies are monitored by officials from the Department and the resources made available are adequate. Should the number of approved bodies increase it would be necessary to review the resources available to ensure continued monitoring of the bodies to acceptable standards. The Department requires that persons proposed for appointment as inspectors are suitably qualified whilst the number of inspectors to be employed is a matter for each approved body to determine.</P>
      <P>Support to the organic farm sector is provided in a number of different ways. Financial support is provided under the rural environment protection scheme and the scheme of grant aid under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99.</P>
      <P>Payments in excess of £3 million have been made to date to organic producers under the REP scheme and a total of almost £225,000.00 has been paid under the organic grant scheme of the operational programme. Grants under the operational programme are projected to be in the order of £170,000.00 for 1999.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides annual funding to the three private organic inspection bodies, Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, Organic Trust Limited and Demeter Standards Limited, and maintains a register of genuine organic producers licensed by the three organic inspection bodies. The number of producers on the register is in excess of 800.</P>
      <P>For the years 1994 to 1996, total funding of £10,000 was provided each year and this was increased to £20,000 in 1997 and in 1998. Provision has been made for a substantial increase for the current year. Payment to each body is made in proportion to the number of inspections carried out. I believe that the measures which I have outlined have encouraged more farmers to convert to organic farming practices and assisted the marketing of organic produce. I expect that the demand for organically produced food will continue to grow in the future and I am confident that with the supports available Irish producers will be well placed to meet the increasing demand.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 198 together.</P>
      <P>The development of markets for Irish beef is mainly a matter for the industry itself, working in conjunction with my Department and Bord Bia. Ireland exports beef to more than 60 markets worldwide. Following the BSE crisis, my Department set about giving assurances to our various trade partners about the extremely low incidence of BSE in Ireland and the effectiveness of our controls.</P>
      <P>Ireland has succeeded in maintaining trade in beef, or in some cases bringing about a resumption in such trade, to all of our traditionally important international markets. I am particularly pleased that, following a detailed review of the control systems put in place by my Department, Russia has now agreed to lift the export restrictions on five counties. The position regarding the other three counties will be reviewed at a later date. Agreement on the lifting of restrictions in the case of Libya and Iran has also been achieved; however, actual trade has not yet resulted in either case. Most recently, Indonesia has sought to purchase Irish beef and the possibilities of this trade are currently being explored.</P>
      <P>Within the EU, Ireland has made significant headway in regaining the position we lost due to renationalisation of domestic markets. Intervention stocks, which had built up since 1996, have now been almost eliminated, leaving the way open for further improvement in the international market. The lifting of restrictions on the supply of the Russian market is a further boost to the Irish cattle and beef sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some backlogs exist at present in the processing of applications under the rural environment protection scheme and the scheme of early retirement from farming. Both schemes have been extremely successful and this is shown by the scale on which they have been taken up by farmers. In 1994, which was the first year of REPS, there were just over 500 participants. This year, that number has grown to nearly 43,000. The early retirement scheme began with 1,000 participants in 1994 but now has over 8,000. The enormous growth in the number of participants has placed an increasing strain on the limited human resources which my Department can <Col N="659" /> dedicate to these schemes among the many other programmes and services which it must deliver.</P>
      <P>Applications under REPS are submitted to my Department's local farm development service offices. Nationally, the average time taken to process an application for first payment is less than four weeks. However 5% of new applicants are subjected to a detailed prepayment check, including on-farm inspection, and the processing of these cases naturally takes longer. In the case of applications for REPS payments in the second and subsequent years, 45% are recommended for payment by the district superintendent generally within a few weeks. The remaining 55% are subjected to on-farm checks which are taking on average eight weeks to do prior to going for payment. In the case of non-compliant participants there are, of course, further delays in processing.</P>
      <P>On the early retirement scheme, 10% of applications are subject to a pre-payment check and 10% of all participants are compliance checked annually. The delay in processing applications, averaged on a country basis, is approximately three months at present.</P>
      <P>While every effort is made to minimise delays, it must be emphasised that when delays do take place they do not result in financial loss to participants in these schemes. Participants in REPS submit a plan and, if the plan is approved they are paid for five years following approval. Processing delays do not result in any diminution of the payment period. Successful applicants for the early retirement scheme receive their pension with effect from the date on which a valid application, including all necessary supporting documentation, is received and allowance is made, in calculating that date, for any delay in processing which is outside the control of the applicant.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to providing an acceptable level of service to its clients. At the same time, it has to be conscious of the need to maintain a level of control which will guard against errors and abuses in the operation of the various schemes for which it is responsible. My Department is constantly reviewing both its procedures and the way it deploys its limited human resources with a view to meeting both objectives to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the national installation aid scheme for young farmers in December 1998, a total of 805 applications have been received in my Department. Of these, 295 applications have been approved and <Col N="660" /> paid to date involving expenditure of some £1.6 million. A further 13 were deemed ineligible as the applicants failed to meet the qualifying conditions under the scheme. There are 497 applications currently being processed by my Department.</P>

      <Quest>the extent to which food quality and health standards are applicable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Food safety and quality standards are applicable across the spectrum of food products and, to this end, an extensive framework of official controls is in place to ensure food safety and quality. These controls and their enforcement involve the combined activities of a number of specialised agencies, both at national and local level, augmented by a wide spectrum of medical, veterinary and scientific expertise.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government's commitment in the Action Programme for the Millennium, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has been established with the statutory function of ensuring the co-ordinated delivery of food safety services throughout the State, and at every level in the State. These responsibilities are exercised via service contracts with existing agencies, including my Department. While most of the activities engaged in by my Department impact to some degree on food safety, there are four main areas &ndash; meat hygiene, milk and milk products, eggs and egg products and the pesticide control service &ndash; where duties include those directly related to the delivery of food safety.</P>
      <P>Food safety is at the core of food quality and only when safety is guaranteed, can our potential to achieve the highest standard of quality be enhanced. Food quality can be a subjective concept of which there are many interpretations reflecting society's changing needs and concerns about such issues as the environment and animal welfare. Quality can, however, be characterised by the feature or set of features that enhance the value of a product in terms of excellence, for example, taste, appearance, nutrition, etc. Such feature or set of features distinguish the product in terms of value from other similar type products and, by extension, enables the producer to benefit from market advantage. Quality assurance measures operate at three interconnecting and developing levels &ndash; obligatory, voluntary and private market-driven schemes. There is a large number of measures dealing with food quality in a structured approach operated by, or under the control of, my Department which spans the range of agricultural commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate fully that the future of our valuable indigenous food industry is contingent on its <Col N="661" /> ability to remain competitive without compromising on safety or quality. I am satisfied that the controls and mechanisms are in place that will enable the industry to do just that in an increasingly global market.</P>

It is expected that these will be submitted to the Council of Ministers in the near future. I will be very supportive of EU wide legislation on the assessment, authorisation, marketing and labelling of GMO feed, especially in the context where a significant level of our animal feed ingredients are imported.</P>

      <P>Payment was made on 114 sheep on 26 October 1999. This payment in respect of 114 sheep was due to an inadvertent link with the number of quota rights he held under the 1999 ewe premium scheme, which was also 114. As this person is also a participant under the REP scheme and as the number of sheep he is allowed to carry under his REPS plan is 153, he will be due a balancing payment on an extra 26 sheep. This payment will be made shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has pursued a four-strand approach to managing the year 2000 issue. Since 1996, <Col N="670" /> Departments and public bodies have concentrated on remedying the problem in computer systems, equipment and plant and practically all critical business and service delivery computer systems are now year 2000 compliant or very nearly so. Since the beginning, of 1999, the focus has been on preparing business continuity and contingency plans for all business-critical operations in the Civil and public Services. The focus is now on the co-ordination arrangements needed between the key sectors and the Government set up a National Year 2000 Emergencies Co-ordination Committee in September 1999, which I chair, to oversee and co-ordinate the year 2000 contingency preparations of the key national utility, health, security financial and business sectors so as to mitigate potential disruptions from year 2000 related incidents and/or millennium celebrations. As the so-called millennium bug problem could potentially impact on businesses which rely on computers and electronic production systems rather than households or household appliances, a comprehensive business awareness campaign is under way under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to raise awareness of the problem and provide guidance on solving it. The campaign includes a guide which issued to 150,000 businesses nationwide, seminars, a national Y2K information service for business, free of charge, and TV and radio advertising campaigns.</P>
      <P>In addition, each of the key sectors involved in the provision of services to the public are providing information to their customers. The banking sector is running a publicity campaign on money and the millennium. The key public utilities, road, rail and air services, gas, electricity, postal, telecommunications and broadcasting services are also engaged in publicity campaigns. The emergencies co-ordination committee is currently reviewing the various sectoral public information campaigns and arrangements with a view to determining what overall co-ordination arrangements might be put in place. The committee will decided on the actions necessary at its next meeting.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the necessary arrangements are being put in place to ensure that in the event that any problems arise, they will be dealt with as quickly as possible so that there will be minimum disruption to services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the independent working group which I established to examine the issue of the taxation of credit union savings was presented to me in October of last year. Earlier this year I made the report publicly available. The group, which comprised officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and an independent chairman, failed to agree on a set of findings. However, the chairman recommended that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed. I have received written representations from the Irish League of Credit Unions and its members in support of the recommendations made by the chairman of the working group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When considering how best to proceed with the demands for tax free savings, including DIRT, for credit union members, one must be sensitive to the EU dimension. While the EU Commission decided not to regard the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions as a State aid, one consideration, I believe, which influenced its decision is the fact that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the Commission to the corporation tax exemption could change if dividends <Col N="673" /> were exempted from income tax up to a certain limit, as recommended by the chairman of the working group. This is a point which complicates the issue and should not be overlooked by those now seeking an exemption of credit union dividends from income tax.</P>
    <P>I am fully conversant with the views of the league as they were contained in the report of the</P>
    <P>working group. However, the differing views within the working group reflect the complexity of this issue. I am giving this matter ongoing consideration and as yet have no proposals to amend the law in this regard.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the business expansion scheme.</P>
      <P>The BES was reviewed in 1998 as it was due to finish on 5 April 1999. It was then decided to extend the tax relief for the scheme for a further two years to 5 April 2001 and this was provided for in the Finance Act, 1999. The scheme will be reviewed again before any decision is taken on whether to extend it beyond 5 April 2001. In the meantime, I have no plans to extend the qualifying trades for the BES.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical criteria for relief from tax under the regulations referred to by the Deputy are specified in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (SI 353 of 1994). A copy of these regulations is available in the Dáil Library. The six types of disablement are persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the administration of the disabled drivers scheme, that they have no record of receipt of an application from the person referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental requirement for the relief that the disabled person must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer. An application for relief cannot be considered by the Revenue Commissioners without the issue of the required certificate.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person referred to, I understand that the issue of the required certificate has been refused and that this refusal was appealed to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal. This is an independent board whose decision is final. I understand that the person was examined by the board of appeal on 16 July 1999 and that the decision of the senior area medical officer was upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the Deputy is aware that an interdepartmental group was established, under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with a view to determine what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme. The existing medical criteria <Col N="677" /> for qualification is one of the issues that have been raised with that group.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that car sales continue to soar in this country. Total net registrations for the first three quarters of the year, at 158,394 are now 26,514 or 20.1 per cent ahead of the same period last year and 14,387 or almost 10 per cent ahead of last year's full year total. To the best of my knowledge, car prices vary throughout the countries within the EU and the tax regimes differ considerably.</P>
      <P>Vehicle registration tax which adds to the price of new cars is a valuable course of Exchequer funding, and I have no plans to remove this tax. With regard to excise duty on motor fuels, I would like to remind the Deputy that the rate in the UK and in Northern Ireland is much higher than that currently obtaining in the State. For example, the pump price of a litre of unleaded petrol for a person resident in the State is around 63p, whereas it is around 87p in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Council Regulation (EC) No. 1139/98 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC applies to foods and food ingredients which are produced, in whole or in part, from a Monsanto genetically modified soya bean and a Novartis genetically modified maize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> The regulation lays down additional labelling requirements for these products. Such labelling ensures that the final consumer is informed of any characteristic or food property, such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders a food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. If genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a foodstuff, then that foodstuff is subject to the additional labelling requirements as prescribed in the regulation.</P>
    <P>Recitals 14 and 15 of this regulation refer to the possibility of setting a <i>de minimis,</i> minimum threshold level to cater for adventitious, unintentional/accidental contamination of foodstuffs with DNA or protein resulting from genetic modification. The rationale for establishing a de minimis threshold is to avoid a situation whereby foods and food ingredients would have to be labelled in cases in which, despite not being from GMO origin, small proportions of modified DNA or protein would be present due to adventitious contamination. Adventitious contamination can potentially occur at many stages of the production chain, from the field, pollen, through transport and storage to food processing.</P>
    <P>A draft regulation amending Regulation 1139/98 setting the <i>de minimis</i> threshold level at 1 per cent was adopted at the standing committee for food meeting on 21 October last. It is envisaged that the European Commission will adopt the measures around the end of the year. As the Deputy will be aware, an EU regulation is directly applicable to and binding on all member states. However, it will be necessary to make national provisions to give effect to this regulation by laying down enforcement powers for authorised officers and imposing penalties for non-observance. I intend to proceed with the necessary arrangements for implementation of this regulation as soon as agreement has been reached at EU level on a validated analytical method to determine whether a foodstuff contains genetically modified protein or DNA.  Work is at an advanced stage at European level to develop a validated analytical method and a workshop on detection methods will be held at the Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy, on 11 and 12 November next. Ireland will be represented there by the State Laboratory and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The <i>de minimis </i>threshold level, set at 1 per cent, means that the proportion of GM material accidentally present cannot be higher than 1 per cent of each ingredient individually considered on a cumulative basis. At a level below this 1 per cent, products not of GMO origin but containing small proportions of genetically modified DNA or protein due to adventitious contamination, will not be subject to the additional labelling requirements as laid down in the regulation. To avail of the provisions of this regulation, economic operators will have to provide evidence that they have obtained their product from a non-GM source. I <Col N="681" /> wish to point out to the Deputy that the establishment of this threshold does not exempt from labelling small quantities of foods and food ingredients from GMO origin whose presence in a foodstuff is not due to adventitious contamination.</P>

      <P>The homeless are a high risk group in relation to a number of health conditions, including tuberculosis. While homeless people would typically have access to the full range of health services without charge, their take-up of services is significantly lower than the general population. The Eastern Health Board has drawn up a comprehensive plan for the provision of a co-ordinated range of services for the homeless in Dublin which takes into account the particular needs of this group. Measures to combat homelessness involve a variety of agencies and in recognition of this, the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion decided that a cross-Department team, to be chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, be established to develop an integrated response to the many issues involved. The team's report will include recommendations in relation to the health services and will be informed by the Eastern Health Board plan which has been submitted to the team. The report of the cross-Department team is expected to be finalised late this year or early in the New Year. I would hope to make progress on the health related recommendations of the team in the context of the year 2000 Estimates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> The Deputy will be aware that I have already given details in the House of the steps I have taken to improve assessment procedures for inter-country adoption. As well as the publication of the consultancy report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo;, I have established a group to oversee the implementation of the report and allocated an additional £500,000 this year to the inter-country adoption service.</P>
    <P>The implementation group has begun the work of prioritising the issues to be dealt with and is taking steps to ensure that the standardised framework of assessment laid out in the report will be put in place as soon as possible. This includes the provision of a seminar to all workers in ICA before the end of the year; the commissioning of a detailed training manual for all stages of the framework as well as back-up documentation for prospective adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>Under the existing legislation adoption assessments may be carried out by health boards and adoption societies registered with the Adoption Board. Any society may apply to the Adoption Board for registration under the Adoption Act, 1952, sections 34 to 39, as amended, which prescribe the criteria to be met for registration. The issue of accreditation of agencies generally is being considered as part of the Department's deliberations on the ratification of the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption.</P>
    <P>However, based on the increase in staff assigned to inter-country adoption assessment, as well as the introduction of a standardised framework model, it is hoped that there will be a significant improvement in the number of assessments being completed during the year 2000.</P>

      <Quest>the position with regard to increasing services for renal patients in view of the fact that each dialysis unit is under severe pressure to cope with the demands of existing patients and the numbers are expected to grow by 12 per cent per year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 240, 260 and 274 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware of pressures that are being experienced and that are anticipated as a result of growing demand for renal dialysis services and has been working with service providers and other relevant organisations in assessing the overall requirements of end-stage renal failure patients. These are being considered in the context of available funding for 2000 and beyond.</P>
      <P>In relation to the new drug payment scheme which was introduced on 1 July 1999, with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit, the primary aim is to bring about important improvements over previous schemes. The scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increase in the threshold, the position is that there has been no increase in the threshold for the previous schemes since 1991. It must also be borne in mind that the new threshold refers to family expenditure as opposed to the threshold in the drug cost subsidisation scheme which related to individual expenditure.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines has been introduced for the GMS scheme and the new drug payment scheme. The introduction of the common medicines list will ensure equity between the general medical services and the new drug payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The comprehensive range of modern therapies required to treat all conditions, which is available on the GMS, will continue to be paid for under the new scheme. This common list will be subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available. Additions and deletions will be notified on a monthly basis. I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that with effect from 1 December 1999 Calcichew will be reimbursable on the common list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the counter products, in general, such as vitamin supplements and cosmetic products are not available under the schemes. Officials from my Department have recently met with represen<Col N="687" /> tatives from the Irish Kidney Association and explained that there are no plans to include the above mentioned products on the common list. However, if a medical card holder is suffering undue hardship in obtaining a product which is not covered under the common medicines list, they may apply to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board for assistance in such instances.</P>

    </table>
    <P>I have had inquiries made of the Mater Hospital regarding this matter and have been informed that the reason for the decrease in the number of cardiac surgery cases performed in 1998 is due to a shortage of skilled nurses in theatre and the intensive care unit. The hospital management is actively involved in trying to recruit specialist nurses for this area and have put a number of initiatives in place. These include conducting interviews for nurses in the UK; improving car parking arrangements for nursing staff; providing study leave for approved courses; facilitating flexible working hours and putting educational facilitators in place to address issues regarding post registration nursing.</P>
    <P>The principal difficulties relating to the recruitment and retention of nurses are concentrated in <Col N="690" /> the Dublin area. While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the country, investment in hospitals and the development of regional specialties over recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area. Within Dublin, issues such as housing costs, traffic problems and lack of car parking facilities have been cited as disincentives to the recruitment and retention of nurses. However, these issues are not unique to nurses or to the health service.</P>
    <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers who take their own initiatives in this regard, a range of initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and where possible improving it. These initiatives include the following: arrangements have been agreed with the nursing unions to allow more favourable assimilation arrangements on to pay scales for nurses taking up both permanent and temporary appointments; a significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units is being introduced; discussions with the nursing unions are continuing in relation to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff; standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions; health service employers have been asked to examine the possibilities in relation to the introduction of term time working as an option for staff with family commitments; the availability of return to working courses for qualified nurses who have been out of the work force is being reviewed with a view to maximising uptake; the Department of Health and Children is currently engaged in discussions with health agencies in relation to the provision of specialist nursing courses at centres outside Dublin; an anti-bullying policy has been prepared and agreed with the nursing unions and is due to be published shortly; the promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing; a &ldquo;Study of the Nursing and Midwifery Resource&rdquo; by the nursing policy division of the Department of Health and Children commenced last year with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs; almost £400,000 was allocated this year to underpin a recruitment campaign, at both local and national level. This was a success as more than 5,500 applications were received this year, an increase of over 40 per cent on the 1998 figure; the annual maintenance grant for nursing students, which is not subject a means test, has been increased from £2,500 to £3,250 since 1997. The grant now is almost double the maximum grant for which other third level students may qualify; the range of leaving certificate subjects that may be presented by an applicant for admission to the nursing diploma programme has been expanded; and the requirement <Col N="691" /> to have a foreign language in the leaving certificate has been removed.</P>
    <P>The changes outlined, together with the national and local recruitment campaigns which I funded, have resulted in a highly successful outcome to this year's competitions for training places on the nursing diploma programmes. A total of 1,215 training places have been filled: 812 in general nursing, 254 in psychiatric nursing and 149 in mental handicap nursing. This is the largest number of direct entrants to nurse training for several years and proves that there continues to be considerable interest among young people and others in nursing as a career.  I also made available funding for some 100 extra training places in general and psychiatric nursing this year and these have been offered to applicants who successfully came through the competition. A further 300 training places will be made available from next year.</P>
    <P>In relation to cardiac surgery waiting lists in general, the Deputy will be aware that in 1998 I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999 I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The cardiac surgery waiting list initiative has a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list. The total number of public patients awaiting cardiac surgery has reduced from 1,619 in September 1997 to 1,106 in June 1999, representing a reduction of 32 per cent.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway, will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>I have received a report from the health board concerned. This indicates that, based on the initial notification in October 1997, the index case of tuberculosis was considered to be non-infectious. As the patient had been in a nursing home prior to his hospital admission, the health board considered it prudent to screen the staff and patients in the nursing home to identify possible sources of infection. This screening proved to be negative and the board considered that no further action was necessary at the time.</P>
      <P>In February 1998 a staff member at the hospital concerned was notified as having been diagnosed with tuberculosis. At that time the health board carried out a review and the patient already referred to was considered to be a probable source of infection. Further screening of contacts was then undertaken in the hospital. This screening included many patients, health care workers and ancillary staff. The health board has indicated that no other case of tuberculosis was identified following this screening and that there was no outbreak of tuberculosis among staff in the hospital.</P>

      <P>The imbalance between the number of male and female consultants has been a cause for concern for some time. It is a major item on the work programme of the forum on medical manpower. A considerable amount of work has been undertaken with young female doctors with a view to identifying the factors which inhibit their progression to the senior levels of hospital medicine. The interim report of the forum, which is nearing completion, will contain a number of proposals to address this problem.</P>

      <P>The two principal national sources of statistics on brain haemorrhage are the hospital in-patient inquiry &ndash; HIPE &ndash; administered by the Economic and Social Research Institute and the annual reports on vital statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office. The HIPE system collects information on each discharge from publicly funded acute hospitals including data on age, area of residence, diagnoses and procedures. The annual reports on vital statistics contain detailed information on mortality by principal cause, age, area of residence and other variables. Data from both HIPE and CSO are available to members of the public subject to safeguards regarding confidentiality.</P>
      <P>The following table presents a breakdown of hospitalisations by broad age groups and county of residence for brain haemorrhage in 1998. It should be noted that private hospitals are not included in HIPE and that persons hospitalised more than once in a given year for the same condition are counted separately in the statistics for each hospitalisation.</P>

      <P>The National Cancer Registry Board was established by my predecessor in 1991, by statutory instrument. Its functions were laid down in its establishment order as follows: to identify, collect, classify, record, store and analyse information relating to the incidence and prevalence of cancer and related tumours in Ireland; to collect, classify, record and store information in relation to each newly diagnosed individual cancer patient and in relation to each tumour which occurs; to promote and facilitate the use of the data thus collected in approved research and in the planning and management of services; to publish an annual report based on the activities of the registry and to furnish advice, information and assistance in relation to any aspect of such service to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1991, the National Cancer Registry has worked hard to build up a comprehensive and systematic picture of trends in cancer illnesses and deaths in Ireland. The first nationwide picture of the incidence of cancer in this country was produced by the registry in respect of 1994. The registry recently published its third national report. This report contains comprehensive data for 1996.</P>
      <P>The data produced by the registry is a vital part of the process required to evaluate the state of our cancer services. The reports that it publishes, and the tailored information which it produces for specific requests, are an essential element of the work to implement and monitor the principles of the national cancer strategy.</P>

    <P>Prior to 1996 an <i>ad hoc</i> service was provided by a number of private orthodontists on a sessional basis together with four of the board's dental surgeons who had the Master's Degree in Orthodontics, M.Orth., qualification. The number of sessions by private orthodontists was roughly equivalent to two wholetime clinicians.</P>
    <P>The opening of the board's regional orthodontic unit in 1996 in St James's Hospital and the development of a consultant led service has resulted in services being brought in line with clinical standards set by my Department and facilitated the integration of the board's dental surgeons with M.Orth. qualification with the consultant service and the phasing out of private sessional orthodontists. The orthodontic service in the Eastern Health Board is delivered by one consultant orthodontist, one senior registrar, five senior dental surgeons with the M.Orth. qualification and eight senior clinical dental surgeons.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care; however, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three rates of subvention payable &ndash; £70, £95, £120 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. It had been hoped to increase the rates of subvention this year but it has not been possible to do so as substantial additional funding in excess of £9 million has had to be provided to meet the rising costs of the scheme. The additional expenditure is due to a number of factors such as the increase in the number of people in receipt of subventions, their higher levels of dependency resulting in more people receiving the higher rates of subventions and the change in the regulations whereby the ability of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 <Col N="700" /> years of age to contribute is no longer taken into account. The amount made available for the scheme this year is £33 million.  Any possible increase in the subvention rate next year will depend on budgetary circumstances and competing priorities at the time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265, 283 and 285 together.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in detail to the House on 20 October 1999, the ratification of the Hague Convention will involve major and fundamental amendment of our inter-country adoption laws. The primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or the sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation among countries in order to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned. In that context, a child centred approach incorporating structures and procedures which accord with good practice in inter-country adoption is being taken into account in the preparation of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach to adoptions from non-convention countries is still under consideration in the Department. However, it is not the intention to exclude any countries with which we already have agreements or working arrangements in place which uphold the spirit and principles of the convention. In addition, one of the items which the convention Bill will have to make provision for is the accreditation of competent bodies, for example, adoption agencies, to undertake certain tasks in relation to arrangements for the inter-country adoption of children. While the Hague <Col N="701" /> Convention provides that countries may accredit such agencies, it also provides detailed criteria for the accreditation of such agencies as well as for the monitoring and policing of such agencies by a central adoption authority.</P>
    <P>Both of these issues are still under examination in the context of the proposed legislation to ratify the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office in 1997, I have invested a total of £91.162 million, by way of additional funding, in services for people with disabilities, including £53 million in mental handicap services and £38.162 million in physical and sensory disability services. This demonstrates the Government's serious commitment to developing these services.</P>
      <P>The information sought in relation to day care places, respite care places and personal assistants is not available in the form requested by the Deputy. However, information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that, as at September 1996, 7,572 persons with an intellectual disability and autism were in receipt of five or seven day residential services and 14,989 persons were in receipt of day services, of whom 1,875 also received residential support services. A further 243 persons were identified as receiving residential support services only.</P>
      <P>However, because of the fact that, for most people, respite services are provided as a secondary service, in addition to their primary service which would be either in educational or day placement, the level of reporting of this secondary service in 1996 did not fully reflect the level of respite services being provided. Data in respect of 1998, which I expect will be available shortly, will more fully reflect the level of respite service for people with an intellectual disability and autism and I will arrange for this information to be forwarded to the Deputy when it becomes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with an Intellectual Disability 1999-2003&rdquo; which is based on information from the national intellectual disability database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with an intellectual disability and autism, including the need for residential-respite and day places. That assessment identified a requirement for 1,673 new residential-respite <Col N="702" /> places and 952 new day places during the period 1999-2003.</P>
    <P>This year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional revenue funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, to continue the process of meeting these needs. This funding will provide approximately 320 new residential places, 80 new respite places and 200 new day places. It will also provide additional health related support services for children with autism, continue the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate placements and provide additional specialist and other support services. The provision of 80 new places specifically for respite care will enhance the level of respite services available to persons with an intellectual disability and autism.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;  which was published in December 1996 recommended the provision of an additional 200 respite places, 100 residential places and 1,600 places in day service facilities during the period 1997 to 2001. The review group costed their recommendations as requiring a total of £50 million over the five year period with £16 million required for day care services, £6.5 million required for residential-respite places and £5 million required for personal assistance services.</P>
    <P>There are currently 195 respite care places available to people with physical and sensory disabilities. This includes the additional 87 respite places put in place between 1997 and 1998. From the capital funding provided this year, a total of £520,000 has been allocated by the health boards for the provision of residential and respite care services and an additional eight respite places will be provided as a result of this funding. Between 1997 and 1998 a total of £841,000 additional funding was provided for day care services and a further £1,578,000 capital funding is being provided this year for these services.</P>
    <P>A personal assistance service is provided in the eastern region by the Irish Wheelchair Association on behalf of the Eastern Health Board. This service currently employs 82 personal assistants providing a service to 52 individuals with disabilities at an annual cost of £789,000. This includes the extension of the service to 17 additional individuals on foot of additional funding provided in 1999. A limited personal assistance service is provided by other health boards. The Centre for Independent Living provides personal assistance services to about 230 people with disabilities through the use of FÁS trainees under the community employment scheme.</P>
    <P>Regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services have been put in place in each of the health boards. These committees, which comprise representatives of the voluntary and statutory agencies and people with disabilities themselves, function in a consultative and advisory capacity to the chief executive officers of the boards in identifying and prioritis<Col N="703" /> ing service developments and the allocation of funding available for this purpose. The health boards were allocated a total of £3 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £6 million in the year 2000, for the development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Finalised reports on the allocation of this funding are currently being drafted by a number of the health boards and, accordingly, final figures are unavailable at this time.</P>

Health agencies have taken a risk management approach to their projects whereby they are dealing with systems and items of equipment in order of their criticality. At 31 July 1999 health boards and hospitals generally had some items outstanding and this was mainly due to dependence on suppliers. Reports to my Department indicate that the great bulk of the work has now been completed, especially where critical items are concerned.</P>
      <P>Health agencies are currently in the process of completing contingency plans and these are progressing well.

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons in the Eastern Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board. Orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board are delivered by one consultant orthodontist, one senior registrar, five senior clinical dental surgeons with M.Orth. qualifications and eight senior clinical dental surgeons. Services are provided from the board's regional orthodontic unit at St. James's Hospital and through its satellite clinics at Crumlin, Blanchardstown, Coolock, Wicklow, Newbridge, Ballinteer, Bray, Kilbarrack, Ballyfermot and Finglas. The waiting time for assessment in the Eastern Health Board is three years and ten months, which has decreased from five years and ten months since 1996 when the consultant-led service was introduced in the board.</P>

      <P>The new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit was introduced on 1 July 1999. The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements over previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines has been introduced for the GMS scheme and the new drug payment scheme. The introduction of the common medicines list will ensure equity between the general medical services and the new drug payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The comprehensive range of most modern therapies required to treat all conditions, which is available on the GMS will continue to be paid for under the new scheme. This common list will be subject to ongoing review and amend<Col N="707" /> ment on a monthly basis as new products become available, additions and deletions will be notified on a monthly basis. I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that with effect from 1 December 1999, Calcichew, a phosphate absorbent, will be reimbursable on the common list.</P>
    <P>Over the counter, OTC, products, in general, such as vitamin supplements and cosmetic products are not available under the schemes. However, if a medical card holder is suffering undue hardship obtaining their medicine which is not covered under the common medicines list, they may apply to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board for assistance in such instances.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department have recently met with representatives from the Irish Kidney Association and explained that there are no plans to include the above-mentioned products on the common list.</P>

      <P>Work is under way in the Department's child care legislation unit on the preparation of legislation in the very complex area of adoption information and associated issues relating to post-adoption contact.</P>
      <P>In March 1999 a consultation document issued to a wide range of interested parties and voluntary support groups inviting them to participate in a consultation process on the preparation of legislation. The aim of the consultation process was to secure an inclusive and well informed approach to the drafting of the legislation. The consultation process concluded in late June 1999 and proved to be a very worthwhile exercise. It brought many conflicting views to the fore and illustrated to all involved the very complex issues which underpin this debate.</P>
      <P>Work is now in progress on building on the outcome of the consultation process and the Office of the Attorney General has been consulted in the matter. The administrative structures required for the implementation of the legislation including the possibility of a post-adoption services board is one of the many issues under examination at present. It is planned to submit the heads of a Bill to Government early in the year 2000.</P>

      <Quest>the reason Ireland does not have a laboratory for testing the presence of e.coli the plans, if any, he has to provide this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Laboratory testing for the presence of e.coli is carried out in the public health laboratories of the health boards. If verocytotoxin producing e.coli, VTEC, is isolated, confirmatory identification of VTEC is unavailable in Ireland and suspect isolates of VTEC must be sent to the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>In early 1999 the Food Safety Authority of Ireland published its report &ldquo;The Prevention of e.coli 0157 Infection &ndash; A Shared Responsibility&rdquo;.  The report provides a framework for the prevention and control of e.coli infection in Ireland.  It noted that there is no simple solution to the prevention of VTEC, including e.coli 0157, and highlighted the need to establish a laboratory facility in Ireland to definitively identify strains of VTEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement between the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland provides for the establishment of six North-South implementation bodies, including a Food Safety Pro<Col N="709" /> motion Board, FSPB. Among the proposed functions of the FSPB are the surveillance of food-borne diseases, the promotion of scientific co-operation and linkages between laboratories and the development of cost effective facilities for specialised laboratory testing. The FSPB is to have a general remit to develop and sustain a strategy for the island of Ireland for the delivery of specialised laboratory services. This includes conducting an early study of the relative cost effectiveness of available options, preparing cost effective proposals for submission to the North-South Ministerial Council and overseeing the implementation of the strategy once approved.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of the FSPB, I will press for it to address the issue of reference testing for VTEC as a priority.</P>

More recently there have been anecdotal reports from the USA of its beneficial use in children with autism. The product is not licensed by the Irish Medicines Board nor is there any application for its licensing. Any future applications received for authorisation of the product will be considered under the normal process of evaluation carried out by the board.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the product is not the subject of a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board, it is not eligible for inclusion in the list of reimbursable items under the General Medical Services Scheme.</P>
      <P>Secretin treatment for autism is still at the experimental stage. Clinical trials have yet to report on its efficacy and on the long-term side effects of using this treatment. Ultimately, a decision as to whether a particular treatment is introduced is a matter for clinical decision by doctors treating patients in the light of clinical trial results, experience and what is considered best practice. My Department will continue, however, to follow any progress in relation to clinical trials and research in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of schemes in place at present which are designed to provide financial assistance to the parents of children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. The <Col N="710" /> domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who have severe physical, sensory or intellectual disabilities and who require constant care and supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age. Eligibility is subject to a means test but only the means of the child are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even if a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Under the long-term illness scheme, persons requiring treatment for a number of conditions, including intellectual disability, can obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Children under 16 who are receiving treatment for conditions arising as a result of an intellectual disability are exempt for public hospital statutory charges.</P>
    <P>Financial assistance is available towards the cost of special dietary requirements which have been prescribed and approved in certain circumstances, that is, for persons diagnosed as coeliac, those with inborn metabolic disorders or those who are chronically or terminally ill. Detailed information in relation to the dietary products for which assistance may be obtained and the circumstances under which this assistance is given is available from the various health boards.</P>

    <P>My Department is primarily involved in the development of health policy. The identification of staffing needs, including PHNs, is a matter in the first instance, for the relevant health boards.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Labour Court's most recent recommendation, LCR 16330. As part of a programme of priority areas for implementing the Commission on Nursing Report, the priorities listed for PHNs are: that a Revised Strategy Statement on the role of the PHN should issue; that PHNs should receive greater support in their role in care of the elderly through the provision of support staff and other services where appropriate; and that PHNs should receive greater support in their role through the provision of new technology and where appropriate clerical support. It is my intention to see that the Labour Court recommendation is implemented in full.</P>

      <P>There are a number of tightly focused and targeted grant schemes currently available to assist especially vulnerable groups such as lower income households and elderly persons to secure necessary improvement works to their homes and I continue to keep these under review.

    <P>I have no proposals to introduce a house improvement grant scheme for the refurbishment and renewal of old or derelict houses on a general basis.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 and 299 together.</P>
      <P>Park and ride facilities are widely recognised as an important instrument in achieving an integrated approach to urban traffic congestion. Well located facilities of this kind can assist in encouraging commuters to leave their cars in secure parking areas and travel by public transport to the city centre thereby reducing traffic congestion.</P>
      <P>Tax incentives, which were included in the Finance Act, 1999, aimed at encouraging the participation of the private sector in the development of park and ride facilities in our major cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The tax incentives cover the county boroughs of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford and the administrative counties of Clare, Cork, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Galway, Kildare, Kilkenny, Limerick, Meath, South Dublin, Waterford and Wicklow and the urban district councils situated in the administrative counties of Kildare, Meath or Wicklow. I issued guidelines in August 1999 on the criteria and requirements to be met by park and ride facilities and associated residential development for which tax relief is sought. Further guidelines will be issued in due course relating to tax incentives for associated commercial development when the necessary EU approval for such incentives has been obtained. It is not intended to extend these incentives to other locations at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> In addition, the provision of £2 million was provided in the 1999 budget for the development of park and ride facilities in the Dublin area. This funding along with own resources expenditure by Iarnród Éireann and local authorities is currently being used for the development of new and the upgrading of existing, mainly rail based, park and ride facilities by the relevant local authorities. It is expected that almost 3,300 car parking spaces will have been provided at locations in the Dublin area before the end of 2000.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Office will continue to promote, with the relevant local authorities and transport providers, the provision of park and ride facilities as an important means of facilitating a shift to public transport. Indeed, the Dublin Transportation Office's Transportation Blueprint 2000-2006 outlines a number of locations where park and ride facilities are considered necessary. In addition, the national development plan will place particular emphasis on addressing transport needs in the greater Dublin area and as part of this will provide for further investment in traffic management initiatives including the provision of park and ride facilities.</P>

A further survey, on behalf of the Homeless Initiative, in March 1999 indicated that there were 275 people sleeping rough in the Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow area. Most of these were in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin local authorities are responsible for the provision of accommodation for homeless people in their area. The Eastern Health Board operates a referral service on behalf of the local <Col N="715" /> authorities to arrange emergency accommodation, whether in hostel, bed and breakfast or other accommodation, for homeless persons. Dublin Corporation, in whose area the majority of homeless people are located, has a cold weather strategy to increase the supply of accommodation, including the establishment of a night-time drop-in service, operated by Crosscare, for homeless people during the winter months. The corporation is also pursuing a strategy to assist homeless people back into independent living or into sheltered housing accommodation with the objective of freeing up emergency hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>The arrangement some years ago with the Department of Defence for the running of emergency accommodation for homeless people was of a temporary nature and was superseded by an arrangement made between Dublin Corporation and the Salvation Army for the running of the emergency accommodation which was located in a building at Lower Grangegorman owned by the Eastern Health Board. In 1998 the emergency accommodation service was transferred to a premises purchased and redeveloped by Dublin Corporation and operated by the Salvation Army on behalf of the corporation.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation is continuously engaged in seeking to identify and acquire premises which would be suitable as both emergency and sheltered accommodation for homeless people. My Department provides 100 per cent capital funding to the corporation in respect of the acquisition and redevelopment costs involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293, 294 and 295 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Community concerning the implementation of Directive 85/337/EEC on environmental impact assessment is currently being considered by my Department and the Office of the Attorney General. Pending the completion of this consideration, I am not in a position to indicate <Col N="717" /> what amendments to national procedures may be necessary.</P>
    <P>The case taken by the commission related to the manner in which Ireland had implemented the directive in the case of certain classes of development. While certain specific developments were referred to by the commission in its case, the decision of the court centred on the establishment of general principles. The court did not make any decisions in relation to any specific development, and there is no requirement to review developments that have already taken place.</P>
    <P>My Department has no responsibility for the payment of grant assistance for land reclamation, afforestation or peat extraction.</P>

      <P>Section 37(2) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended by section 49(1)(e) of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, provides that persons convicted of certain offences must carry notice of their conviction(s) on their respective driving licences by way of endorsement for a minimum period of three years, which can be continuous or discontinuous. The Act also provides that where a convicted person is not the holder of a current licence at the time of a conviction, the details of such conviction must be endorsed on the next licence granted to that person.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to comment on individual cases involving the administration of these provisions, responsibility for which rests with local licensing authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fire safety in the home is the responsibility of individual householders and there is no scheme operated by my Department to finance or install smoke alarms. The building regulations set out requirements in relation to fire safety in the design and construction of new buildings and the extension of, or material alteration to, existing buildings. Though the 1991 edition recommended the fitting of battery operated smoke alarms, which are cheap and easy to install, survey evidence indicates that householders often forget to check or replace batteries. The revised Technical Guidance Document B (Fire Safety) which I published in December 1997, recommends that houses built and-or extended on or after 1 July, 1998, should be fitted with mains operated smoke alarms, rather than battery operated alarms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> The National Safety Council actively encourages fire safety in the home as part of its ongoing fire safety education and publicity campaigns. Particular stress has been placed in its campaigns on the value of smoke alarms which, if properly installed and maintained, can provide early warning of fire and save lives. The council has also carried out a campaign in recent years to install smoke alarms in houses occupied by the elderly and other vulnerable persons. In addition, local authorities have been asked by my Department to consider the provision of smoke alarms in their rented dwellings. The provision of smoke detectors is best achieved in this way with the voluntary co-operation of householders in the interest of themselves and their families and I have no proposals to introduce a scheme for the financing or installation of such alarms.</P>

      <P>A brief for the Kiltimagh sewerage scheme is with my Department since 1992 but has not been approved. Schemes not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme come within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998, which asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-06. The Kiltimagh sewerage scheme is eighth on Mayo County Council's priority list of sewerage schemes.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for developing and disseminating road safety advertisements and publicity is assigned to the National Safety Council, which promotes television and other media and awareness campaigns on road safety on a continuing basis. The focusing of these campaigns is a matter for the council having regard to the prioritisation by the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 of the key areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing.</P>
      <P>Campaigns and promotions targeting cyclists are run by the National Safety Council. Leaflets entitled Going To School and Pedal Sense were circulated to schools and public libraries in September 1999 as part of the council's educational development programme to improve safety awareness among cyclists and give advice on road safety matters generally. In addition to major national campaigns, the council also supports and encourages the organisation of projects, including cycle training at local and community levels.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at present to make the wearing of helmets for cyclists mandatory. The consensus of public authorities concerned with road safety has been that the wearing of helmets by cyclists is best promoted on a voluntary basis by way of educational and publicity campaigns, such as those undertaken by the National Safety Council. The rules of the road recommend that because of their vulnerability cyclists should, in their own interest, wear protective headgear at all times. In addition, the rules of the road offers advice on manoeuvring a cycle, including cycling at night.</P>
      <P>The safety of cyclists was also a leading concern of the manual, Provision of cycle facilities &ndash; National Manual for Urban Areas, produced by the Dublin Transportation Office on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and has been circulated to all local authorities. The manual contains a comprehensive set of guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities.</P>

      <P>The conditions governing the new house grant scheme normally preclude payment of a grant where a person who is party to a joint application or the spouse of such person had previously purchased or built, individually or with each other, another house for his or her own occupation. However, a grant may be allowed where the marriage of the person has been dissolved or annulled by court order, or the person is separated under a court order or a deed of separation, and the person and any dependants are in need of housing; and the Minister is satisfied that refusal to pay a grant would cause undue hardship. Each such application is considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, having regard to the fact that under a separation agreement the applicant received the beneficial interest in the family home, payment of a new house grant could not be allowed.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to local authority housing.</P>
      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their existing dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the general responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources and information is not available in my Department on the number of local authority houses which do not have a central heating installation. However, where capital funding is being provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major structural works to designated estates, the installation of central heating in these houses may form part of the works undertaken. In addition some authorities have been granted approval, on foot of specific proposals, to the use of internal capital receipts to provide central heating in particular cases.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were advised in February 1994 that full central heating should be provided in all new local authority housing as part of the overall cost of the schemes. The choice of heating system and fuel should be determined by the local authority primarily by reference to expected capital and running costs, including possible servicing and maintenance costs, and the preference of the likely occupants.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency &ndash; EPA &ndash; is currently updating the national waste database, which provides comprehensive statistics and information in respect of 1995, and I understand that a report in respect of 1998 will be published shortly. It will be possible more precisely to evaluate trends in waste arisings when this information is available. However, the EPA in Environment in Focus (1999) indicated that household and commercial waste arisings are growing at some 4.5 per cent each year. By comparison, GDP has grown in real terms by an average of 8.5 per cent per annum between 1994 and 1998.</P>
      <P>Waste generation is clearly linked to economic and industrial activity, and the need to break the link between economic growth and waste generation presents a significant challenge to all developed countries. The European environment agency, in its 1999 report Environment in the European Union at the turn of the Century indicated that reported total waste generation in OECD Europe increased by nearly 10 per cent between 1990 and 1995, compared with GDP growth during that period of about 6.5 per cent in constant prices.</P>
      <P>Under the Waste Management Act, 1996 local authorities are required to make waste management plans in respect of their functional areas, and the EPA is required to make a national hazardous waste management plan.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the waste hierarchy, the statutory objective of these plans is to prevent or minimise the production and harmful nature of waste; encourage and support the recovery of waste, and ensure that such waste as cannot be prevented or recovered is safely disposed of.</P>
      <P>Local authorities generally are well advanced in the development and adoption of waste management plans, in most cases on a regional basis. Available plans and draft plans provide for a range of measures to be undertaken in support of waste minimisation.</P>
      <P>The EPA recently published a proposed national hazardous waste management plan for public consultation over a two-month period. The cornerstone of the proposed plan is hazardous waste prevention and, to this end, the adoption of an ambitious hazardous waste prevention programme is recommended.</P>
      <P>It is the intention further to expand upon the policy issues and guidance outlined in Changing our Ways with the publication of a further policy statement which will address the prevention, minimisation and recovery, including recycling, of waste. This policy document will address the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives and targets in this area and will outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in the interests of a sustained improvement in national waste management performance.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the students summer jobs scheme is to provide income support to students of less well off families who are unable to obtain summer work and are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance. As the scheme is targeted at students who cannot qualify for unemployment assistance the means test which must be satisfied in order to participate is broadly similar to that currently applicable for qualification for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>In the case of self-employed people, the means test for unemployment assistance, which is set out in legislation takes into account income from self-employment less any expenses necessarily incurred. This also applies to the means test for the students summer jobs scheme.</P>

      <P>Arrangements have been in place for some years now to enable rent supplement recipients to retain their rent supplement on taking up employment, subject to certain conditions. Any person who avails of my Department's back to work allowance scheme, job assist or other employment support schemes can retain their rent supplement for three years, subject to a maximum payment of £250 per month, provided their household income does not exceed £250 per week.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, my Department is aware that the withdrawal of rent supplements paid under the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme can act as a disincentive to those seeking to take up employment in some cases. This is particularly so in the case of people with dependants and people taking up part time employment.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment which the Government made in &ldquo;Partnership 2000&rdquo; a process of consultation has commenced to examine a tapering arrangement for SWA housing supplements, in consultation with the social partners.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the registration of landlords with local authorities is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. From 1 <Col N="728" /> May 1996 regulations oblige the local authorities to compile a register of landlords in their respective areas. However, I understand that only a minority of landlords are registered.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. At any given time, there are some 41,000 tenants in receipt of a rent supplement. Under the legislation governing SWA, the health boards are not required to ensure compliance with registration requirements before awarding a rent supplement. It would be invidious to discriminate against the tenant or to confine or restrict their freedom of choice regarding the accommodation or where they choose to reside on the basis of the failure of a third party &ndash; the landlord &ndash; to comply with his or her obligations.</P>
      <P>The report of an interdepartmental committee set up to consider the implications of transferring the administration of SWA rent supplements to the local authorities was published in August 1999. That report points out that restricting rent supplements to accommodation that is registered would impact adversely on the availability of accommodation for rent supplement claimants.</P>
      <P>It has been recommended and agreed however, that the restriction of rent supplements to accommodation that is registered and complies fully with regulatory standards should be set as a policy objective to be achieved as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>Consideration will be given to incorporating this feature in the new scheme of rent assistance which will be operated by the local authorities, as announced by the Government last August.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme an allowance of £43 is payable in respect of children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £58 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. These rates were last increased in 1996. However, the clothing and footwear component of the consumer price index published by the Central Statistics Office has been falling since 1996 and fell by 7.3 per cent between October 1998 and September 1999. These payment rates cannot be viewed in isolation from the significant improvements in primary weekly payments which I have implemented.</P>

The scheme is designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the workforce.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 5,217 people participating in the back to education allowance scheme. The estimated expenditure for the 1999 calendar year is £22.4 million.</P>

      <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General to which the Deputy refers was received in this Department on 24 June 1998. In addition to the back to school clothing and footwear scheme, the report examined the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, including rent and mortgage interest supplements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the follow up work carried since the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report has concerned the future administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements. Last August, the Government <Col N="733" /> announced that it had agreed in principle that a new scheme of rent assistance will be introduced which will be operated by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the back to school clothing and footwear scheme, a working group was established in September 1999 to review the scheme as part of this Department's series of programme evaluations. The working group has met three times and has consulted with a wide range of interested parties. Submissions have been received from officials who operate the scheme, from health boards and from eleven other organisations.</P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. This applies to long-term payments, such as pensions, only; it does not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The question of extending entitlement to child dependant allowances to short-term welfare claimants on the same basis as applies to long-term welfare claimants is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to the resources available and to other competing priorities.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider the position of self-employed persons who were over the age of 56 years in 1988 when they were compelled to pay PRSI contributions and denied a pension in view of the fact they were unable to pay the ten years contributions required before reaching the age of 66 and are still not helped in spite of the fact that last year's budget had a partial pension but not to people born before 1927 who are still being denied any contributory pension in view of the fact they could not contribute the five years required; and the measures, if any, he will introduce to rectify this unjust situation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The same qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension apply to all insured people, both employees and self-employed. These qualifying conditions require a person to have entered social insurance at least ten years before reaching pensionable age, which is 66 and have a minimum of 156 contributions paid. In line with the recommendations of the national pensions board, this requirement will increase to 260 and 520 paid contributions from April 2002 and April 2012, respectively and have a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited from 1953 or the date of entry into social insurance, if later.</P>
      <P>However, in line with this Government's commitment to extend contributory pensions coverage to people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension, I introduced, last April, special arrangements for a very specific group of people. These are self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed who could not qualify for a pension as they did not satisfy the standard requirement of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
      <P>An old age contributory pension is, therefore, now available to those self-employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have, at least, five years contributions paid since then. The rationale behind this five-year paid contribution condition is to ensure that entitlement to a pension is limited to those who have made some reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers. Payment is at a flat-rate of 50 per cent of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable.</P>
      <P>I consider these arrangements to be fair, reflecting a certain consistency of commitment to the social insurance fund, over a given period of time.</P>

There is currently no limitation on the number of places available under this strand of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am closely monitoring the level of demand for places under the back to work allowance scheme. Demand for places is still buoyant and I am anxious to ensure that this highly successful scheme continues to be available to provide an incentive to persons who may wish to move out of long-term unemployment and return to the active labour force.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance scheme is non-statutory and, consequently, decisions cannot be appealed to the social welfare appeals office. Decisions under the scheme are made in the Department's local offices and all appeals are determined centrally by an official at higher executive officer level. Since 1 January this year, 172 appeals have been lodged, of which 84 were allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> At present, 17,900 employees and 19,080 self-employed are participating on the scheme.</P>
    <P>Since the scheme commenced a total of 10,800 people have completed the three or four year cycle of financial support available under the scheme. A small survey of a sample of these carried out recently showed that 85 per cent had not returned to the Live Register six months after the allowance ceased with the remaining 15 per cent returning to receipt of a social welfare payment. A second evaluation of the scheme is currently being undertaken by independent consultants with the focus primarily on persons whose allowance has expired or terminated. It is expected that this will be completed around the middle of next year.</P>
    <P>The minimum age limit of 23 years is designed to target the scheme at those who are most likely to need this assistance. It is felt that persons under this age are in a better position to seek out and avail of the job opportunities without the need for the financial incentive which the scheme provides. There are no plans at present to reduce this age limit.</P>
    <P>There are no indications that significant financial disincentives exist to participation in the scheme. It should be noted that persons with families can also gain access to family income supplement to further increase their take home pay. Currently some 9 per cent of recipients have four or more children.</P>
    <P>The objective of the scheme is to provide a financial incentive to the long-term unemployed, who could not otherwise do so, to return to work. Applications should therefore be made before a person takes up employment. In practice, applicants must apply within four weeks of commencing work. I consider this to be a reasonable approach, as the acceptance of later applications would increase the dead-weight costs of the scheme which are currently at an acceptable level.</P>

    <P>I announced the establishment of a new organisation called COMHAIRLE on 23 December 1998. This new organisation will be responsible for the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services for all citizens throughout the country, including people with disabilities. It will combine the National Social Service Board &ndash; NSSB &ndash; with relevant func<Col N="738" /> tions of the National Rehabilitation Board &ndash; NRB.</P>
    <P>I appointed a new NSSB board comprising of a chairman and 19 other members in 1998. This board will be designated as the board of COMHAIRLE as soon as the necessary legislation has been enacted. I reappointed Dr. Donal De Buitléir as chairperson of the new board from 8 September 1998. All other board members were appointed on 20 November 1998, with the exception of Mr. Peter Sands who was appointed on 8 May 1998. Apart from reasonable travel expenses, board members do not receive any remuneration for their services. The board members appointed by me are:</P>

      <P>To qualify for the back to education allowance, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for at least six months. One of the qualifying payments is disability allowance which is payable to people who are long-term incapacitated. People in receipt of disability benefit do not qualify for this allowance but there are arrangements in place under which a person may be permitted to undertake an education or training course while in receipt of disability benefit where this would assist in fitting them for another job. These arrangements are considered to be effective and there are no plans at present to extend the back to education allowance scheme to recipients of disability benefit generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 345 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme &ndash; NFS &ndash; is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week &ndash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &ndash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid April.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that in 1999 approximately 288,400 people will receive a fuel allowance of £5 per week for the 26 weeks of the fuel season. In addition, approximately 114,100 people will also qualify for the smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last six years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44.9 million in 1998. This year a sum of £46.4 million has been provided in the estimates for the scheme.</P>
      <P>While the last increase in the fuel allowance was in October 1985, fuel price inflation has been much lower than general price inflation. The rate payable cannot be viewed in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from the beginning of June 1999.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to provide a fuel allowance at a different rate to specific group, and treat them in a different manner to other fuel allowance recipients.</P>
      <P>In any event, any changes in the rate or duration of payment would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to change the situation whereby a widow, who is employed and receiving a contributory widow's pension on the basis of her late husband's contributions, only receives half of the unemployment benefit rate if she becomes unemployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22654/99]</QRef>

    </P>
    <P>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern): The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual.</P>
    <P>However, an exception to this rule is made in the case of widows, widowers and other lone parents who are sick or unemployed. Where a person who is in receipt of a widow(er)'s pension or one-parent family payment satisfies the relevant contribution conditions, they may be entitled to receive disability benefit or unemployment benefit at half-rate for a period of up to 15 months, in addition to their pension. Furthermore, if they are entitled to a widow(er)'s pension or one-parent family payment at a reduced rate, for example, on the basis of insufficient PRSI contributions or on account of means, the rate of that payment is also increased up the maximum level for the duration of their claim for disability benefit or unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>These provisions discriminate positively in favour of widowed people and lone parents. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the current arrangements for payment of disability or unemployment benefit in addition to widow(er)'s pension and one-parent family payment are reasonable.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in the State aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance, to carers of people in receipt of prescribed relatives and constant attendance allowance and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>In addition, widows-widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement. This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes are also available to low-income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a <Col N="743" /> means-test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, which is currently £89 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and £94.00 for a recipient aged 80 years or over; plus £30; plus any increases for dependants or for living alone.</P>
    <P>The extension of the free schemes to all widow/ers and pensioners could only be considered in a budgetary context with due regard being paid to the availability of resources and the need to set priorities among the various other competing demands being made on all areas of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>A fundamental review of the free schemes is being carried out to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes an examination of the qualifying conditions for the schemes, the target group and the scope for alternative policy arrangements.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes, which is already at an advanced stage, is being carried out by an official of my Department on secondment, as a visiting research fellow at the policy institute, Trinity College, Dublin. The conclusions of the review will be considered in the context of budget 2000.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the research conducted will be formally published by the policy institute in the Trinity Studies in Public Policy series in January 2000.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> In order to qualify for the allowance, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and must satisfy a means test.</P>
    <P>The income limits for the allowance are based on social welfare payments and are automatically raised each year in line with the budgetary increases in those payments. Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable because this payment is targeted at those on the lowest incomes.</P>
    <P>The income limit for a couple with four children is £210.30. The person concerned has a total weekly income of a little over £276, derived from earnings of £214.60 plus £56 family income supplement. While family income supplement is disregarded as means for the purposes of this scheme, the person concerned still does not satisfy the means test for receipt of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.</P>
    <P>It is open for the individual in question to appeal the decision to the appeals officer in the Eastern Health Board. An appeal form has been forwarded to the person by the community welfare officer.</P>
    <P>A review of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme has recently commenced as part of my Department's series of programme expenditure evaluations. The suggestion that the rules of the scheme be amended to enable payments to be made to people marginally above the income limits will be examined in that context. Any change in the means test would, of course, have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>if officials of her Department examined the Church of St. Paul on Arran Quay, marriage place of former President, Éamon de Valera, which is now lying empty; the proposals, if any, she has to impose conditions on its future use; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22508/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera): My officials have not been formally approached about the Church of St. Paul but they are aware that it is not in use. The church is a neo-classical building dating from 1835-43 designed by Patrick Byrne. It is of national significance. It is a listed building in the Dublin city development plan and the primary responsibility for determining its future use in the light of any development proposals is a matter for Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, from 1 January next the entire building, including the interior, will be protected as a result of measures introduced by the Government under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999. If proposals do arise for the future use of the building which require planning permission the planning authority will be required to consult with my Department who can offer advice at that stage.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department, with the co-operation of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, is preparing general guidelines for planning authorities in relation to the conservation of the architectural heritage. A series of seminars will take place shortly with local authority officials to acquaint them with the new arrangements to strengthen the protection of the architectural heritage.</P>

The altarpiece and statuary are by the neo-classical sculptor John Hogan. The building and its contents are of international significance. Primary responsibility for the protection of the architectural heritage rests with the planning authorities.</P>
      <P>From 1 January next protection will extend to the interior also and works be undertaken on the building without planning permission. If any proposals arise the planning authority will be obliged to consult with my Department who will offer advice on the future conservation of the building. In the meanwhile contact will be made with the owners to advise on the importance of safeguarding the building and its fixtures.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken major steps this year to strengthen the protection of the architectural heritage. Apart from the legislative measures introduced, additional resources have been made available both to my Department and to local authorities to assist their work in this area.

      <P>The Presbyterian Church, Adelaide Road is a 19th century neo-classical building erected in 1840 from the designs of William Farrell. The building is of regional importance because of the quality of its facade. It is primarily the responsibility of the planning authority to protect the architectural heritage and my role is mainly an advisory one. While in this instance planning permission has been validly obtained to demolish the church, while at the same time retaining the facade, it is understood that this has been appealed and is currently being considered by An Bord Pleanála.</P>

      <P>The scientific statement provided by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, to An Bord Pleanála indicated the reasoning behind the proposal to designate the Carrowmore Dunes a special area of conservation &ndash; SAC &ndash; and the extent of this site. This statement did not encompass the area adjacent to this site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report the Deputy refers to, prepared for Dúchas, recommended an extension to the boundary of the proposed SAC. Dúchas did not accept the recommendation of this report as it was inconsistent with the criteria it uses to propose SAC sites for Vertigo angustir. Sites are proposed for this species only where listed habitats, meeting the criteria of the Habitats Directive, are also present. Sites to be proposed in accordance with these criteria will fully meet Ireland's obligations, under the Habitats Directive, in respect of Vertigo angustior. In the case of the Whitestrand-Carrowmore Marsh, Doonbeg, proposed natural heritage area, these criteria are met <Col N="748" /> only within the smaller area put forward as the Carrowmore dunes candidate SAC.</P>
    <P>There was no obligation to provide this report to An Bord Pleanála as the determination as to what land will be proposed for designation as an SAC is not a matter in which An Bord Pleanála has a role. I understand that the report made available to An Bord Pleanála by the developers, together with the environmental impact assessment, provided it with sufficient data in relation to habitats and species, in the area of the development, to assess the application from an environmental point of view.</P>

      <Quest>the policy of her Department in relation to the blanket bogland adjacent to the approach road to Cleggan from Clifden, County Galway, in view of the fact that a Dúchas report dated 19 March 1999 states that the area would merit designation based on its present condition and it is joined by an area of high scenic amenity in the Galway county development plan.</Quest>

      <P>The area in question meets the criteria listed in the habitats directive, as to habitat, for designation as a special area of conservation. However article 3.2 of the directive states: &ldquo;Each Member State shall contribute to the creation of Natura 2000 in proportion to the representation within its territory of the natural habitat types and the habitats of species referred <Col N="750" /> to in paragraph 1.&rdquo;. My Department has already proposed approximately 250,000 ha of blanket bogland for designation as special areas of conservation, and in view of article 3.2 has met its obligations in respect of this habitat type under the directive. It is not proposed to designate additional blanket bogs for this designation. The directive provides no means to designate land for its scenic value.</P>

      <P>Wicklow County Council is vested as the owner of Tomnafinnoge Wood <Col N="751" /> near Shillelagh, County Wicklow. Ownership is to transfer to Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department once legal formalities are completed. In anticipation of the forthcoming transfer Dúchas has recently carried out works &ndash; clearing the river and restoring the riverside roadway. Both of these were conditions of the initial sale of the land to Wicklow County Council and Dúchas, as successor to the council, has carried out the works to comply with that conditions. This has enhanced the amenity and recreational value of the site for visitors.</P>
      <P>The wood has recently been designated as a candidate special area of conservation &ndash; SAC &ndash; as part of the ongoing programme to implement the EU habitats directive. A conservation plan will be prepared for the site in due course which will take account of the future amenity and recreational use of the wood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357, 358 and 371 together.</P>
      <P>I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions, by way of reply to parliamentary questions, the position regarding ground rents.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the position is that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No 2) Act, 1978, already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwellinghouses. Part 111 of the (No. 2) Act, provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwellinghouses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 13 times the ground rent. The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the purchase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. There is also no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the (No. 2) Act.</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill 1997, has raised constitutional, technical and practical difficulties of a kind which cannot be easily overcome. If and when those difficulties can be met in a way that would substantially improve on the already good and reasonable system that exists for the purchase of ground rent, the necessary legislative details will be announced in the normal way.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that I discussed the subject matter of the Bill at a meeting with ACRA some time ago.</P>

      <P>Arising from growing evidence that the common travel area was being abused by persons who were not entitled to avail of it, an amendment was made to the aliens orders in June 1997 which gave immigration <Col N="754" /> officers the power to carry out checks on persons arriving in the State from the UK and to refuse such persons leave to land on the same grounds as apply to persons arriving from outside the common travel area. These checks are carried out selectively, in contrast to those on persons coming from outside the common travel area who are obliged to apply to an immigration officer for leave to land.</P>

      <P>Following the Government decision of July 1997 and the resolution of the industrial relations problems on the use of retired public servants, the Department of Finance gave sanction for 72 posts on 27 February 1998 to put together an asylum task force. Arrangements were made to source the staff, comprehensive training was provided in conjunction with the UNHCR, systems were put in place and operations commenced in earnest on 5 May 1998. That date can therefore be regarded as the starting point from which we have begun to fully address the backlog of applications.</P>
      <P>On the recommendation of the reconvened interdepartmental committee on asylum, immigration and related matters and in order to maintain the momentum in the processing, the Government decided on 28 July 1998 to approve a further 72 posts to concentrate on processing the cases through the appeals stage and to provide for the needs that exist in immigration and citizenship division and the aliens registration office as a consequence of the administrative burden caused by the influx of asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>In December 1996 there were 4.5 staff assigned to full time asylum duties. By the end of 1997 the number of staff dedicated to dealing with asylum applications had risen to 23 and by the end of 1998 the total number was 109. The task force has a current staff of 118 staff, with nine vacancies, giving a total authorised complement of 127 staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>An allocation of £0.3 million in 1999 was announced in the budget to fund a communications programme with the aim of empowering travellers and also to promote a greater understanding between travellers and the settled community. A sum of £300,000 has been <Col N="770" /> provided in my Department's Estimate for 1999 under subhead S &ndash; equality monitoring-consultative committees &ndash; to fund the programme. The programme, which is entitled <i>Citizen Traveller</i>, was formally launched on 27 October 1999. The objective of the programme is to address the underlying causes of mistrust between the traveller and the settled community, while at the same time creating an immediate awareness of certain issues.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department provides funding to a number of community groups and voluntary representative organisations. Many of these have the authority to partake in media promotions relevant to their functional area but would not necessarily inform my Department of the details of their media campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall strategy of traveller communication programme is being divided into a number of activities. These will include market research, lobbying, media relations, advertising, promotions, appropriate training, and ongoing com<Col N="771" /> munity activities involving settled and traveller communities. Projects in the area of public relations and public affairs have also been developed. These will involve media training of five regional and five national spokespeople from the traveller communication committee.</P>
    <P>The communication programme will also involve an outdoor advertising campaign using hoardings, radio adverts, press adverts, information packs and direct mail packages as advertising methods. Additional projects are also planned, such as a small grant fund for traveller groups undertaking a communications approach to new or existing projects, and the monitoring of traveller issues in the media.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the programme is being managed by a committee, known as the traveller communication committee. The committee which was originally known as the traveller media advisory group is made up of representatives of the Irish Traveller Movement, the National Traveller Women's Forum, Pavee Point and the Parish of the Travelling People. Its chairperson is Fr. Dan O'Connell, C.M. of the Parish of the Travelling People. The committee has appointed a director and an office administrator to manage the day to day operation of the programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the funding for the traveller communication programme is provided for the objectives as specified above and is not to be used for purposes other that those for which it was intended. Expenditure on the programme is monitored closely by my Department on an ongoing basis. My Department receives details of the committee's proposals and costs at the beginning of each quarter and tranches of funds are provided to the committee only after its quarterly expenditure plans have been approved by my Department.</P>

    <P>I can inform the Deputy, however, that the average waiting time for processing applications for registration in Limerick is 26 weeks. The average time for processing an application for registration which is in order and does not require mapping is two to three weeks. The average time to process an application for a copy file plan map is 24 hours where the application is made at the public counter, which represents over 50 per cent of all cases, and two to three weeks where the <Col N="772" /> application is made by post, unless a specific difficulty arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the problem of crime committed by juveniles would not justify the establishment of a rapid response unit in each Garda district. While there are high levels of crime committed by juveniles in some districts, in others it is quite low.</P>
      <P>In areas where juvenile crime levels are high, the gardaí operate or are involved in crime prevention initiatives such as the Garda juvenile diversion programme; An Garda Síochána special projects, of which there are currently 29. Proposals for the development of new projects in 2000 will be considered, subject to the availability of funding; local drugs task forces; integrated services process and Garda schools programme.</P>
      <P>Crime committed by juveniles is also addressed through Garda involvement in child care advisory committees and local partnerships. The Deputy is, I am sure, aware that the Children Bill, 1999 will also provide a wide range of alternatives for dealing with juvenile offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a local level, operations are implemented by Garda management to deal with specific difficulties. Local Garda personnel, in particular community gardaí and Garda juvenile liaison officers are actively involved in working with young people. These members are supported by special<Col N="773" /> ist units such as local and national detective and drug units, district-divisional crime units, dog unit, mounted unit and air support unit, as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am responsible for the provision of primary medical services to prisoners. It is policy that prisoners be provided with an equivalent standard of health care as citizens in the general community who are entitled to services under the Health Acts. I am advised in relation to the structure and organisation of a broad range of prison-related health services by the director of prison medical service who co-ordinates the provision of such services.</P>
      <P>Each prison has one or more part-time doctors who are responsible for the health care of prisoners within that institution. Where a prisoner requires specialist hospital care, either as an out-patient or in-patient, arrangements are made for this to be provided in an appropriate hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The core recommendation of the 1998 annual report of the director of the prison medical service is for an independent review of the structure and organisation of prison health care services. <Col N="774" /> This recommendation was echoed in the recently published report on the prevalence and risk of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV in Irish prisoners. I have accepted this recommendation and have asked the director general of the prison service to bring forward proposals for a multi disciplinary review group as a matter of urgency. His report on the matter is now with me and I expect to be making an announcement shortly. I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to ensure that all prisoners can continue to avail of the required level of health service while in custody.</P>
    <P>The study by the centre for health promotion at UCG, referred to by the Deputy, is a research project that I commissioned to examine the overall health status of the Irish prison population. This study has not yet been completed and any comment on possible findings or recommendations would be premature pending its completion. It is envisaged that the study will be completed during the first half of 2000. It is my intention to publish the findings of this research as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Prior to this, my attention had not been drawn to the position in relation to sign language interpreters for deaf students pursuing a business studies course in Roslyn Park. My understanding is that this college has provided such a service by employing interpreters from Irish Sign Link, the national co-ordinating agency for interpreters. This agency which is a registered charity is grant-aided by the Department of Health and Children; the agency is funded by the NRB which also provides office accommodation for the agency. At present there are only two full-time interpreters on Sign Link's list who are available for work in the Dublin area; one of these interpreters is working 3.5 days per week in Roslyn Park college. The agency faces a heavy demand for interpreting services which at present it cannot meet. The supply of sign language interpreters is not a matter for my Department but is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children and of the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>

      <P>In 1996 the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are however a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of bachelor of education, on the basis that these courses in Ireland were subject to a quota based on policy decisions on the appropriate levels of graduate output.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, as the person to whom the Deputy refers is pursuing degree course in B.Ed. &ndash; Honours &ndash; primary education in Glasgow she is ineligible for assistance under the terms of the student support schemes.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulty to which the Deputy refers. My Department recently allocated funding to schools to facilitate the appointment of escorts on all special school transport services. The school to which the Deputy refers was included in this allocation and received £19,980 to facilitate the appointment of four escorts on the bus routes serving the school.</P>
      <P>Many of the schools in question have already confirmed that they are proceeding with the appointment of escorts to their special transport services. However, some schools have expressed concerns regarding their involvement in the operation of the scheme and have not yet appointed escorts. I understand that the board of management of the school to which the Deputy refers has yet to decide its position on the matter.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting with representatives of the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, which represents the special schools, I repeated my belief that the most appropriate people to operate the escort scheme are the schools which are catering for the children on a daily basis and are familiar with their needs and behaviours.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I recognise that individual schools may encounter particular difficulties in putting their escort scheme in place. I have therefore arranged for officials from my Department to meet with the National Association of Boards of Management of Special Schools in an effort to resolve any outstanding problems. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will make every effort to accommodate schools in their implementation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I fully support the development of all-Irish second level provision in north east Dublin, and I have recently re-affirmed my commitment on this matter to the promoters of Coláiste Mhéanscoil.</P>
      <P>Following examination by my Department it was indicated that there would be significant demand for such a facility in view of the growth in the number of all-Irish primary schools in North Dublin. This examination also highlighted the fact that there is surplus post-primary accommodation in some schools in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, one of the schools concerned offered the use of its surplus accommodation to the promoters of the all-Irish facility. The school in question has a strong disposition towards the Irish language and its teaching staff was very supportive of the proposed initiative. The offer involved immediate access to satisfactory class<Col N="782" /> room accommodation and as much autonomy as was practicable within the existing management structure. If the offer had been accepted, it would have enabled an all-Irish post-primary facility to commence in September 1999. Regrettably, however, the offer was refused on the basis that the promoters wished to have a fully independent school.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the considerations that led the promoters to reject the offer but I am aware, also, of existing arrangements of this nature operating successfully as part of a second level school. In addition, as Minister for Education and Science, I have overall responsibility to ensure that the use of existing school accommodation is maximised.</P>
    <P>I had a constructive meeting with the promoters on Wednesday 13 October 1999 at which they made a number of points to me. I undertook to consider the points made and I will be in touch with them again as soon as I have examined other alternatives.</P>

      <Quest>if he will approve the issue of tenders and start of construction of the proposed sports hall at Pobal Scoil Neasáin, Baldoyle, in view of the long wait by the Baldoyle and mid-Sutton area for this facility.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has received an application for a physical education hall at Pobal Scoil Neasáin, Baldoyle. This project is currently at stage 2 &ndash; outline sketch scheme &ndash; of architectural planning.</P>
      <P>Arising from my recent decision to substantially increase the size of PE halls within post primary schools, stage 2 is currently being amended to reflect the appropriate increased size.</P>
      <P>The question of inviting tenders and proceeding to construction will be considered when architectural planning has been completed.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this project has waited a long time and I am sure he will appreciate that the major increase in funding for school capital projects has made it possible.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will arrange a proper transport system to the convent primary school, Thomastown, County Kilkenny, for pupils living in the area of Danesrath, Elmdale and Ballinamona who are without the service and who have been constantly requesting it due to the increased number of pupils attending the school from the area affected; and if he will arrange an immediate review of the current system to cater for the above demand.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the children to whom the Deputy refers reside in the Knocktopher <Col N="783" /> closed school area. This former school amalgamated with Ballyhale national school. Under the terms of the school transport scheme, children in a closed school area may be eligible for free transport to the school of amalgamation only. As the children in question are attending another school the most that can be offered is concessionary fare-paying transport on the existing service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fare-paying tickets may only be issued where there is accommodation available after all eligible children have been catered for, and no additional State cost is involved by way of altering or extending the route of a service, or providing an additional or larger bus. In the circumstances, I <Col N="784" /> regret it is not open to my Department to provide a service as requested.</P>

      <P>The managerial authorities of the Christian Brothers' secondary school in New Ross appointed a design team prior to my Department agreeing schedules of accommodation and without reference to my Department. School authorities have never been delegated sanction to engage consultants in the expectation that my Department would be bound by any such arrangements. Acceptance of such arrangements would almost certainly contravene public procurement procedures with which my Department must ensure complete adherence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures employed by my Department for the appointment of consultants are designed to ensure that relevant EU and national procurement regulations are adhered to and that the systems used are transparent, fair and equitable. <Col N="786" /> Consistent with my Department's procedures, nominations for the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning of the proposed project at this school have been provided to the school's board of management. Unfortunately, architectural planning of the project cannot begin until the board appoint a design team from the nominations provided.</P>

      <P>There is no question of granting full recognition to holders of a BA and a higher diploma in education for primary teaching purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However I presume the Deputy is referring to my decision to pay persons at the trained rate of pay who are working in a temporary capacity in <Col N="787" /> primary schools; possess a primary degree and a higher diploma in education; and have obtained a grade C or higher in the higher level leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>The arrangements outlined above have been put in place for this school year as a short-term measure to overcome the difficulties caused by the shortage of fully qualified primary school teachers. While it is accepted that they are not qualified primary school teachers, in my view it is the best option in resolving the current difficulties in the short term.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measure outlined above, last year I put in place arrangements for primary degree holders with a higher diploma in education to be paid at the trained rate of pay in respect of any substitute work which such persons undertook. It is not a requirement for persons with such qualifications who are engaging in substitute work to possess a grade C in Irish as substitute work is normally of a much shorter duration than temporary work.</P>
    <P>In the case of the person referred to by the Deputy I can confirm that this person was paid at the trained rate in respect of substitute work which she undertook last year. This will continue to be the case should she undertake any further substitute work in this school year. However she will not be remunerated at the trained rate should she take up a temporary appointment, as it is necessary for persons in temporary posts to possess a reasonable degree of fluency in the Irish language.</P>

      <P>The question of the provision of school transport in this case has been reviewed in the light of the representations and medical evidence forwarded by the Deputy. The position remains, however, that as this child resides 1.5 miles from her national school she is ineligible for transport under the terms of the school transport scheme. It is also not possible to facilitate her on a concessionary fare-paying basis as the 2 p.m. service from the school does not operate to her home area. Special transport arrangements or extensions of existing services may not be allowed for basically ineligible pupils, as is the case with this child. I regret my Department is not in a position to facilitate the child in question.</P>

      <P>In 1996 the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In general, the approved courses in other EU member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are however a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education, on the basis that these courses in Ireland were subject to a quota based on policy decisions on the appropriate levels of graduate output.</P>

      <P>Since the publication of the paper discussions have been held with interested parties. In addition a series of consultative meetings will be held in the near future in relation to the issues raised in the paper.</P>
      <P>My purpose in publishing the paper is to provoke a thorough and wide-ranging debate on these complex issues. The consultative process provides an opportunity for all concerned to contribute to future policy formulation in relation to the modes of assessment at junior certificate. I hope that there will be the fullest participation and engagement with the consultative process and ultimately my decisions on the issues will, of course, be informed by contributions made in the process.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to improve the level of staffing at second level schools in County Galway in order to reduce class size and provide greater opportunities for teachers to give additional attention to students in need of extra tuition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should point out that this school year is seeing the first allocation of additional teachers to second level schools for some years. This year provision was made for 225 additional teachers and this, together with the retention of some 130 teachers who would otherwise have been redeployed, is enabling us to provide a remedial teaching service in every second level school and also to bring all disadvantaged <Col N="791" /> schools into the home school liaison scheme. I have also made improvements in the provisions available for guidance in our schools with a guaranteed minimum allocation now available to every school.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing for additional teachers, I have, this year, introduced a new retention ratio for secondary schools. The impact of this is to retain in schools teachers who would otherwise be liable to be redeployed. In all some 150 teachers have been retained under this initiative and these teachers will continue to be available to improve the quality of education in our schools.</P>
      <P>At second level the issue of disadvantage is closely linked to the incidence of early school leaving. For that reason I have put in place a number of initiatives focused on this difficult and intractable problem. In addition to the eight to 15 initiative, a new stay in school initiative is now commencing.</P>
      <P>The issue of class size in second level schools is very complex. Analysis of this issue conducted by my Department indicates a very varied pattern of class size across the second level sector. In general senior cycle classes are appreciably smaller than those at junior cycle and the pattern across subjects can vary significantly. It is in the nature of some subjects that they attract a relatively small cohort while traditionally core subjects account for larger classes. It is also the case that schools with like enrolments and resources can have quite different patterns of class size.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the principal concern in relation to class size must be the impact on educational attainment. In this regard, the great body of research indicates that the major impact of class size is to be found in the early years of primary education and for disadvantaged groups in particular.</P>
      <P>In the 1998-99 school year the pupil-teacher ratio at second level was approximately 15.4:1. Allowing for the increase of some 225 teachers and a projected drop in enrolments, it is expected that the pupil-teacher ratio will reduce to approximately 15.1:1 in the current school year. This represents a decline in the actual PTR from that which prevailed in the 1970s. Within the current PTR there are a large number of very small classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approaches to enrolment and redeployment at second level have remained relatively static over many years and one result of this is that there is <Col N="792" /> no necessary link between the allocation of additional teachers and the achievement of key educational priorities such as widening subject and programme choice. It is also the case that present redeployment arrangements fail to achieve a balancing of necessary resources among schools. For these reasons I have recently written to the union and management interests indicating my intention of having these issues examined by a technical or expert group in consultation with the various interests.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I have a strong commitment to continuing to improve the resources available to our schools. It is vitally important that investment in education in all its forms has the ultimate well being of the pupil at its core and I see the review which I have mentioned as being of considerable value in achieving this objective.</P>

      <P>The early retirement scheme for teachers is a voluntary scheme which consists of three strands. Strand 1 is available to teachers who are experiencing professional difficulties, strand 2 is available to teachers aged 55 or more and who have difficulty in adapting to change, strand 3 is available in the case of teachers who are surplus to requirements.</P>
      <P>The scheme was introduced in 1996 for primary teachers and in 1997 for teachers generally. The number of teachers who retired each year under each strand is set out in the tabular statement. Posts arising from retirements under strands 1 and 2 are fillable and in all cases where the school authorities have declared it to be necessary, a replacement has been approved. In accordance with the provisions of the early retirement scheme, posts arising from retirement under strand 3 may not be filled.</P>
      <P>The 1999 figures in the tabular statement do not include two cases, one primary strand 2 and one secondary strand 1, where the application has been approved but a decision from the teachers regarding acceptance is still awaited.</P>
