      <Quest>the steps, if any, being taken to address the administrative shortcomings of the Offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor identified in the report of a case (details supplied); the further steps, if any, being taken to deal with the shortfall in resources and the heavy workload in the Chief State Solicitor's office which the DPP concluded contributed to failures in the case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25140/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>The Taoiseach: I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General sought a report on the organisational questions arising from the events surrounding the case in question. The DPP's report was made public as soon as the director made a decision on a possible retrial.</P>
    <P>The report contained five specific recommendations for improvements in procedures. The Chief State Solicitor's office has implemented the first four. The fifth suggested a review of the procedure whereby one solicitor prepares the book <Col N="546" /> of evidence and a different solicitor attends court at the trial. This will be considered in the context of the transfer of criminal prosecution work from the CSSO to the DPP.</P>
    <P>In my reply to questions on 19 October last about the Nally group report on the public prosecution system, I informed the House that the Government had accepted the group's key conclusions and recommendations and had agreed to implement immediately the recommendation to transfer the criminal division of the CSSO, as well as the State solicitor service, to the DPP.</P>
    <P>The process to implement that recommendation is under way. A group comprising the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General, including the CSSO, and the Office of the DPP has been set up to oversee the transfer. The group is considering the staffing levels and structures necessary in the enhanced prosecution service. The objective is to implement the changes without delay and I understand it is intended to advertise the new post of solicitor to the DPP shortly. The staffing position in the CSSO is being examined in parallel.</P>
    <P>The Nally report also contained a number of recommendations designed to improve the information and communication capabilities of the prosecution system and these will also be implemented.</P>
    <P>Following a review of the Chief State Solicitor's office in 1996, a number of changes were made, including the introduction of new technology and a reorganisation within the office. These changes, however, have not fully addressed the problems. The workload of the office has continued to expand at an unprecedented level, not least arising from the hearing loss cases and the need to service tribunals.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is particularly conscious of the difficulties faced by the Chief State Solicitor's office, especially as regards staffing levels and recruitment. I assure the House of his and the Government's concern and determination to address the difficulties of the office as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Other developments such as the more proactive approach to the management of personal injury claims against the State envisaged by the establishment of a State claims agency will also reduce the burden on the CSSO by reducing the volume of litigation.</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Bruton: Is the Taoiseach saying, in that lengthy reply which concerns procedures and workloads, the reason the mistake was made in the Nora Wall case was all to do with an excessive burden of work?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach: I am sure Deputy Bruton has had an opportunity to see Mr. Hamilton's correspondence which was put into the public domain some weeks ago and in which he outlines at some length all of the reasons for this. Towards the end of the correspondence, Mr. Hamilton refers to the workload of the office. The mistake certainly <Col N="547" /> was not all to do with the workload but the volume of work, the number of cases, the time involved, the number of staff and the relatively frequent turnover of staff who leave to take up opportunities elsewhere certainly puts an increased burden on the office.</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Bruton: What are the other reasons? Does the Taoiseach agree that it is deplorable that any citizens should be put through what the defendants in this case were put through if they are innocent, as is clearly the case in this instance? Does the Taoiseach also agree that it is important that in media reports of cases of this nature, the &ldquo;guilty until proven innocent&rdquo; approach should guide or inform the choice of headlines and text? </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that. In all cases, people should not be declared guilty until the case is over. The reasons are fairly lengthy and I can only quote those given by Mr. Hamilton. The decision to call the person arose initially because counsel failed to recall the direction from the DPP's office not to call this witness following which he directed that she should be called.</P>
      <P>In turn, there was a failure on the part of the other lawyers involved in the case to notice the contradiction between direction from the DPP's office and counsel's advice on the proofs and to take corrective action on that point. In addition, the initial instruction to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to notify the accused of the intention not to call the person was not acted on.</P>
      <P>Mr. Hamilton went on to say human error occurs inevitably in any system in any organisation but what is important is to take reasonable measures to identify such errors when they occur. He went on to say that so far as is known, it is the only occasion in 25 years of existence of the DPP's office on which such an error of a witness being wrongly called occurred and that this may be relevant to any judgment of whether it was a reason to anticipate such in any event being likely to occur. Mr. Hamilton went on to give some lengthy positions. He said, nevertheless with the benefit of experience gained as a result, it is possible to identify a number of improvements, which he went on to outline.</P>
      <P>In summary, he said &ndash; it is probably the best way to explain this to the House &ndash; the problems which have been identified arise principally from weaknesses in the systems of communication between the three sets of lawyers involved in the case &ndash; the DPP's professional officer, who gives directions as to the prosecutions on the director's behalf, counsel, who conducts the case in court, and the instructing solicitor who is responsible for ensuring that the directions of the DPP's office and counsel are carried out, that counsel is properly instructed and the case is ready to proceed to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steps now being taken, if followed, reduce the likelihood of a similar error arising again. In <Col N="548" /> addition, the recommendations of the Nally report on the public prosecutions system are implemented. The establishment of a new solicitor to direct the public prosecutions accountable to the director and the transfer of responsibility for the local State solicitor's service to the director will improve the communications and the arrangements for responsibility and accountability as between the DPP and his professional officers and the solicitors who handle the cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is part of the problem that there were three sets of lawyers involved? When three sets of people are involved, communications difficulties are almost inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. As the Deputy knows, the Nally recommendations, which I mentioned, said it would be better if the same solicitor handled a case through the system. The recommendations and the subsequent meetings on staffing issues indicate that it would mean a considerable number of additional staff. From memory, the office would require another 25 staff to deal with that, not to mention ancillary staff. It is being looked at.</P>
      <P>The decisions of the Nally report to remove the prosecution service and the State solicitor service nationwide, from the Chief State Solicitor's office to the DPP, is being examined and staffing levels are being looked at. What would remain in the Chief State Solicitor's office is being reflected on. It would be an enormous transfer, but that decision has been accepted in principle and the operational procedures are taking place.</P>
      <P>I do not want to hide the fact that although the office has staff, unfortunately, the grading situation is leading to a position where people are working for a year or two and those who meet the standard are selected and head-hunted. This is happening to a degree which has not been experienced before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the State intend to formally apologise to Nora Wall for the bungling? As regards the letter of 1 October from James Hamilton, the DPP, from which the Taoiseach extensively quoted, he chose deliberately not to quote the last sentence which was that the failures in the performance of the duties of the CSSO were largely related to a lack of resources. In the official reply the Taoiseach gave to the House, he said the question of resources was being reviewed. Other than the appointment of a new solicitor to the DPP, he did not indicate whether extra resources would be made available. Irrespective of the allocation of the posts and restructuring of those posts within the DPP's office, can the Taoiseach say in principle whether a decision has been made to make extra resources available? He said in an aside to a supplementary question that when the national claims agency legislation is put in place it will further reduce the burden on the CSSO. However, that legislation has been delayed for more than a year, though <Col N="549" /> bearing the incompetence of the Minister for Finance in mind, that is not surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of an apology has still to be addressed. The DPP has commented on this, as has the Attorney General. Admittedly, a formal apology has not been made. I did not read the full letter, but I gave a clear reply to Deputy Bruton, stating that the heavy overload of work is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach read the last paragraph? We will then have that on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly. I have only read about three paragraphs of a seven page letter, but I will read the last paragraph:</P>
      <P>Finally, in my opinion, the failures on the part of the Chief State Solicitor's Office which contributed to this incident must be attributed in part to the shortfall in resources at that office and over-heavy workloads carried by its officers. These problems have worsened in recent times and require to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>In my reply I pointed out some of the reasons for that office being tied up. The staffing issue is being examined, as I said. A group&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that I know it is being looked at, but has the Government made a decision in principle to make extra resources available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government accepts that if the Nally report is to be accepted, which the Government has approved in principle, it will take extra resources. The working group now dealing with this has had a number of meetings. This briefing note is now somewhat out of date, as the group has had at least three meetings. It consists of the Attorney General, the CSSO, the DPP and the Department of Finance. It has identified additional staff needs and my briefing note states that 24 solicitors, five technical and 13 support staff are needed. That is being discussed, not only in the context of this work, but for the transfer of the whole prosecution service. The chief State solicitors of each county can then go to one office and the existing office will be restructured to deal with the remaining work. There will be substantial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there are particularly long delays in the DPP's office in respect of files forwarded by the Garda arising out of investigations into allegations of child sexual abuse? Given the new procedural and administrative arrangements, will he consider a separate division of the DPP's office being dedicated to such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be for me, but I will raise that point. There are longer delays on the civil side, but I accept that there are delays. That <Col N="550" /> workload of the office has increased massively every year in the 1990s. Despite all the technology that the previous Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson, brought in and the fact that that policy was carried on by Mr. Byrne when he was Attorney General, the sheer volume of work has grown. Almost 30 extra members of staff have been taken on in the past two and a half years and before that an enormous number of staff had been taken on &ndash; there are now approximately 220 to 230 people working there. The office has grown massively, but there is still a huge workload. This is the third review in three years and it has now identified a need for another 23 or 24 solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>In this case with such a high profile, counsel failed to recall the DPP's instruction that a specific witness was not to be called, junior counsel forgot to advise senior counsel, the Garda assumed senior counsel had been in touch with the DPP's office, the solicitor in court on the day was not the solicitor who prepared the book of evidence and the professional officer who issued the direction was on holidays. Will the Taoiseach agree that in a case where an innocent person is wrongly convicted, we are not talking about a weakness in communication but downright incompetence? If such a litany of blunders occurred in the private sector, heads would roll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to add anything other than what the new DPP stated in his report. According to the outgoing DPP and the incoming DPP, I must reflect that to the best of their knowledge it is the first time in 25 years this has happened. It was a series of substantive errors, there is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to my last question the Taoiseach said that additional resources will be required by the office. Can I take it from that he is saying the Government is committed to making additional resources available when they are sought? </P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the question posed by Deputy Jim Higgins. In view of the litany of incompetence he outlined, does the State intend to pay counsel for their bungling in regard to this case or has a direction issued from the Attorney General's office to the DPP that the people who screwed up so majestically on that occasion will not be paid by the taxpayer for adding insult to injury?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the staffing issue, I do not want to mislead Deputy Quinn. The working group is considering the number of staff who will be required and that is still under negotiation. Resources will be made available, although I do not know what the final number of staff will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional resources will be made available?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we pay for the incompetence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What is cleared by the DPP is not a matter for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the State and the media, which have done an injustice to the accused in this case &ndash; in the media's case, by judging them guilty before that was proven &ndash; should volunteer an apology without having to be brought before the courts again in a civil case by the defendants? Will he also agree that any compensation or apology should be given freely now and the agony ended rather than dragging the matter through the courts, yet again with the State and the media having to be asked reluctantly to apologise for attaching the word &ldquo;evil&rdquo;, in three inch headlines, to the accused in this case only to find that they were acquitted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from what the Taoiseach said that he does not feel responsible, but can I take it he is abdicating responsibility in terms of whether a composite degree of incompetence as outlined by Deputy Jim Higgins will be paid for automatically by the State? Surely the Taoiseach of this Republic has some influence in saying to the relevant paymaster that in this instance they should not to be paid?</P>

      <P>Is this a case of the lawyers telling us what to do again? This arose in relation to the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; argument. Notwithstanding what the advice may be or any civil suit that may ensue, given that for the first time in 25 years a person was manifestly wronged in the name of the State, is there not a case that the Taoiseach should offer at least a minimal apology on behalf of the office for which he is now answering questions?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have explained on a number of occasions that I have had discussions with the Independent Deputies who support the Government. In these meetings the Deputies have indicated their priorities. In some instances the Deputies have indicated some of these priorities to the House and in other instances they have found other ways of publicising the priorities.</P>
      <P>All Members of the House are aware that we have increased expenditure on a range of Government programmes and, in particular, our capital programmes. As already announced in the national development plan, further increases are planned in the programmes and this will allow the Government to further accelerate and bring forward proposals for completion earlier than planned. It is my intention over the life of the Government to deal, as expeditiously as possible, with as many of the issues brought to my attention by these Deputies as possible.</P>
      <P>The House is aware of the priority the Government has given to county roads, water and sewerage treatment, education, tourism and rural development and the additional resources we have provided for them. Many of the priorities indicated by the Deputies are priorities for their respective local authorities and some are included in the review of the programme for Government and the national development plan.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that one or two of these Deputies have already indicated publicly in the past 24 hours that they no longer support the Government in so far as its budgetary policy is concerned? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that these questions are about Independent Deputies who support the Government, does the Taoiseach agree that the reply would be altered if the Deputies in question no longer support the Government? Does he intend to take any steps to alter the provisions of <Col N="554" /> the budget to enable the Deputies in question to support it on the basis that they believe it to be fair rather than unfair, as is currently the case? </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 17 November, the negotiations on a new social partnership agreement, which were launched on 9 November, are subject to confidentiality strictures. However, the discussions have focused on the broad positions of the different social partners and many of the themes identified in the NESC overview have been discussed.</P>
      <P>A scheduled meeting with the social partners was held yesterday. The focus of discussion was on the budget, particularly in the partnership context. I will make a statement on the budget later this evening and I will meet each of the social partner pillars tomorrow evening. Obviously, I cannot comment further, except to say I believe it is crucially important that we achieve a successful outcome to the partnership negotiations which, together with the national development plan and the budget, form the basis for delivering on the vision in the NESC document, to which we all subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Centre for Partnership, established under Partnership 2000, has undertaken a significant amount of work in the past six months, as agreed by the board. The work undertaken falls into a number of broad categories. Under training, in the public sector the programme entitled Working Together &ndash; A Training Programme for Partnership in the Public Sector, has been developed by the NCP and this training programme is now being delivered within organisations across the Civil Service and the wider public service. For the private sector, a 13 module <Col N="558" /> training programme and a supporting video have been developed jointly by the NCP, IBEC and ICTU as a very substantial contribution to enterprise level partnership. A business plan for the joint delivery of this programme in early 2000 is being implemented at present.</P>
    <P>The NCP has also been working closely with a number of private and public sector bodies to facilitate promotion of the concept and implementation of partnership. In the private sector, the NCP has conducted a series of regional seminars on the topic of partnership at enterprise level. IBEC and ICTU have been active participants in the seminars and the feedback has been positive.</P>
    <P>In September, I opened an inaugural annual conference on partnership at enterprise level organised by the NCP. The conference featured contributions at policy level from speakers from Ireland, the UK and Sweden, as well as inputs from practitioners in the areas of partnership.</P>
    <P>In the public service, the development of a database is in hand to monitor the progress being made in the partnership groups in each sector. The intention is to set a best practice standard to assist management and staff to deliver an enhanced working environment and efficient service to the public. It is also intended to use this database to promote more research and development into the partnership process in the public service.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ongoing work of the NCP an evaluation of the progress made on partnership in both the public and private sectors and the associated role of the NCP is currently under way in my Department. It is expected that the consultants engaged to carry out this evaluation will submit their report this month. This will form a useful backdrop and context to assist discussions on future action on partnership, post-Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 24 November, I addressed a conference for public sector union officials and activists on the theme of social partnership in Ireland. The aim was to review the future developments of partnership and chapter 10 of Partnership 2000. It was a well attended conference and the National Centre for Partnership will be following up with practical support on the ground on the outcome of the conference.</P>
    <P>In my address to the conference I stressed the importance of our public service being organised and equipped to contribute effectively in order to sustain and enhance the success of partnership in recent years. We must be flexible and able to respond to the changing environment. Partnership, as a vehicle to modernise the public service, will play a vital role in this process.</P>
    <P>I also referred to the problem we still have of how to reward genuine improvements in performance in the public service. In this context I referred to gainsharing as part of an overall reward and recognition strategy for the public service. The social partners will be addressing this <Col N="559" /> important issue in the context of the negotiations on a new social partnership agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The social partners had already stated that this would be the last budget under the last round and that the Government had substantively gone beyond their increases in it. In their various meetings they set down the kind of issues they wanted to see dealt with. They all put down those issues and, by and large, they have been well dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is disastrous that a budget containing the largest amount of money ever given away has brought social partnership to the brink of collapse with the largest union withdrawing from talks with the Government? Is this not a disaster, particularly in view of the neglect of the low-paid in the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted the pre-budget statements of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU. Mr. Des Geraghty, in an interview in <i>The Examiner </i>before the budget,said he wanted to see people on low pay further taken out of the tax net. That happened. He wanted to see people on basic income and under the average industrial wage taken out of the higher rate of tax and he wanted to see as many people as possible taken from the higher rate and put into the lower. He has already indicated his strong support for those measures. The voluntary pillar in the social partnership generally stated that there are other issues which they want to see delivered on. We are now negotiating the next round for the next number of years. The last number of years have been well catered for and I hope we will do the same in the discussions ahead.</P>

In view of the expectation that a substantial reduction in low pay tax rates was on offer and had been recommended by the NESC, the budget that has emerged at the behest of the Progressive Democrats &ndash; Attorney General and all &ndash; is a travesty of what was expected? Can the Taoiseach indicate whether he now believes that, as a consequence of that, social partnership has been put at serious risk for the first time?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The contingency provision of £500 million in the national development plan is in respect of the longer term development of the suburban rail network and the underground section of Luas. Among the options for the future development of the suburban rail network being evaluated by Ove Arup from a feasibility and cost perspective as part of the strategic rail study are <Col N="564" /> a new inland rail link to Navan. Also included is the separation of long distance and commuter rail traffic through the construction of bypass rail lines, including a new rail link from the Belfast line through Swords and Dublin Airport to the western lines and a new rail link east of the loop line in Dublin city centre. Other options are the quadrupling of existing double lines where feasible and the provision of enhancement of rail services to the development centres identified by the strategic planning guidelines. Phase one centres include Drogheda, Naas/Newbridge/Kilcullen, Wicklow and Navan, and phase two centres include Athy, Arklow, Kildare and Monasterevin. Another option is more sophisticated signalling technology to increase track capacity.</P>
      <P>The strategic rail study will be completed during January. Only then will it be clear what specific projects are being proposed for implementation as part of the longer term suburban rail development programme. Not all the options will necessarily be recommended and some may be mutually exclusive. The £500 million contingency is a significant sum of money. However, I assure the Deputy that, if further resources are required at a later stage, they will be provided. My priority now is to spend the contingency fund which has been set aside and to spend it well.</P>
      <P>Regarding Luas, geotechnical studies of the proposed underground section in the city centre are taking place and the results of those will be available by the end of the year. It should be borne in mind that all the projects just mentioned are medium to long-term projects and that the national development plan provides for funding up to 2006.</P>

Would it not be easier, given the amount of money the Minister for Finance must invest in foreign economies to secure our pensions, for him to invest some of it in Aer Rianta, which is a good investment? He could make money at home and it would be a Government investment. Will she not return to that position rather than going the inevitable road of privatisation?</P>

      <P>Competition and consolidation in the postal market and new technology are driving change at a rapid pace across the EU. Combined with the spread of communications technology and the development of e-commerce, this creates an imperative for An Post to redefine and reorganise itself over the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Government accepted my pro<Col N="568" /> posals on the need for the company to engage in a radical transformation process. The Government has agreed that part of this transformation will involve a strategic alliance with one of the major European operators and agreement to early liberalisation of the postal market. The Government has also given the go-ahead for negotiations on an employee share ownership scheme which will be part of the transformation. I have asked the company to consider the various options on a strategic partnership and to put proposals to me at an early date.</P>
    <P>As was reiterated in the recent White Paper on Rural Development, the Government remains committed to the retention of the post office network. I have asked the company to allocate £5 million from the proceeds of the sale of Postgem-Ireland on Line specifically to the upgrading of the rural sub-post office network. The company has agreed to my proposal and is currently considering the options for investment in the rural sub-post office network. Following receipt of proposals from An Post, the Government will finalise its consideration of the provision of some matching funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister a timeframe for when An Post will return to her and when she will take the matter back to Cabinet? Does she see the proposed strategic alliance as a commercial arrangement or would it involve the sale of equity? If it did involve the sale of equity &ndash; the proposal concerning Aer Rianta is to sell 30% &ndash; would she see that in all circumstances the State would retain 51% or a majority stakeholding in view of the very important rural and social services which An Post, uniquely, provides?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Management and the unions in An Post came to me and my officials saying they needed to address this matter, otherwise they would be overwhelmed by the force of change in postal services throughout Europe. I do not have a timeframe but I will communicate with the Deputy on this matter. No timeframe was set down as they came to us with force and urgency and we agreed to move forward.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of equity in terms of a partner. Neither am I in favour of privatising any part of An Post. I note the UK balked at such a position, but a report in <i>The Guardian</i> last Saturday said that 800 rural post offices would be closed in the UK. The report spoke about the devastating effect this would have on the rural landscape. I do not deny that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on An Post which was completed some years ago decided that a number of rural post offices should close. I am not in favour of doing that. An Post still has hankerings in that regard, but the Government is not in favour of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A partner could bring expertise or markets. Once equity is given, influence is brought to bear on the company far beyond the worth of the money provided. I agree that An Post is not like any other semi-State company. It is very intimate <Col N="569" /> and widespread and it affects everybody in the country who receives mail or uses the services of the post office.</P>
    <P>Commercially An Post lives on the edge. It does not make big money, it just breaks even. Something will have to be done to get it into the slipstream of more technology and better working practices etc. That is the road which is now being embarked upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In her statement of 30 November and again today the Minister used the term &ldquo;radical transformation process&rdquo;. I understand what she means by this, but this is a very labour-intensive business employing 8,500 people, who often interpret the phrase to mean wholesale job losses, be they voluntary or otherwise. The Minister will recall that in relation to Telecom Éireann there was an assessment regarding the numbers of jobs which would go. Does the Minister's Department have a view on jobs and job security? Can she give the staff some comfort in relation to their future job security given that, subsequent to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report of 1996, seismic reorganisation is already taking place? Can she allay the fears of staff that there will not be further job cuts?</P>

They are only beginning that process and radical transformation is needed. It is a case of whether An Post can survive, and I believe it can survive.</P>

      <Quest>the reason she is not responding to applications from the private sector in view of the Government's invitation in summer 1999 to private coach operators to tender for new, feeder and orbital routes.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25823/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July last I announced that the Department's guidelines for consideration of bus licence applications under the Road Transport Act, 1932, were being amended, particularly in respect of the greater Dublin area. This amendment indicated that the Department would be open to applications for routes not directly served by CIE or private operators, including feeder services providing links to the existing public transport network, orbital services in major urban areas linking outer suburban areas to each other, and radial services catering only for passengers with origins or destinations outside major urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also indicated at that time that the Department had commenced preliminary work on a <Col N="570" /> review of the options for effective regulation of the bus market with a view to introducing legislation to replace the Road Transport Act, 1932. The Government decided last month that this review of the 1932 Act should be accelerated and completed in three months and that it should be conducted with a view to the introduction of competition in Dublin bus services.</P>
    <P>Wide consultation will take place so that all interested parties will have an opportunity to express their views on the future arrangements for regulation of the bus market, particularly in Dublin. I expect the review to be completed in February 2000.</P>
    <P>Since my announcement on 14 July last, one licence has been granted in respect of a premium service for passengers embarking or disembarking at Dublin Airport. Approval in principle has also been given for licences in respect of services between Dublin Airport and Howth Junction and between Swords and Leixlip. However, as appropriate documentation has not yet been provided, no licence has issued for these services.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable increase in licence applications in recent times and this has placed pressure on staffing resources in the licensing section of my Department. This has caused considerable and regrettable delays in the processing of other applications. While some additional resources are being provided, priority will be given to completing the review within the timeframe decided by Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government took office, 32 applications have been received from private operators and two operators have been licensed. The Minister of State's reply is extraordinary. The licensing section of the Department has been stretched by answering two letters in two and a half years. Far from ignoring those applications, the Department should be begging these people to provide a service on all of the routes mentioned in the reply, as well as the late night services. Given that there is no legislative barrier, is it not illogical of the Government not to allow those private operators help Dublin Bus to provide the service it is currently not equipped to provide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. There are a number of applications in the Department which need to be processed. Last July I announced my intention to proceed with the licensing of private bus operators. The Government took a decision recently which will move forward this whole process. It has decided to expedite the review of the legislation which will be completed in three months. That is being done in the interests of those applications already received and others which will be forthcoming. This is something to which I have aspired for a long time, and I welcome the Government decision to expedite the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been talking about <Col N="571" /> bringing forward the review of the legislation for the past two and a half years. The deployment of the 150 buses bought out of the Luas money, welcome as they were, had no impact on Dublin's traffic, given that the demand for transport is growing faster than we can deploy buses. It makes no sense to engage in further studies when it is clearly evident that there is a demand and the only way that demand can be met quickly, in order to keep Dublin moving, is either by the provision of private buses or of additional buses for Dublin Bus. Dublin Bus does not even have enough buses to meet the growing daily demand. Will the Minister of State accept that it is too late for further studies and that we have gone beyond that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Deputy's sentiments. The problem has existed for 67 years, not just two and a half years. Successive Governments, including those in which the Deputy's party participated, put up with this antiquated legislation and, as they say in Wicklow football circles, they &ldquo;fumped&rdquo; it. This Government has not fumped it, however. It is taking this matter by the scruff of the neck and dealing with it. I agree with the Deputy that a demand exists, but that need is now being met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and I met Sir Reg Empey, the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and we had a very good discussion. We agreed to pursue urgently the upgrading of the main North-South electricity interconnector from 280mw to 400mw. The cost of the upgrading, which is estimated at £15 million, will be borne by both the ESB and Northern Ireland Electricity, supported by grant aid from the EU.</P>
      <P>The work is expected to take 18 months. This will be a concrete example of North-South co-operation and will be of benefit to electricity consumers on both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>We also reviewed developments in the gas sector. The opening of the gas market in the South has paved the way for a market-led response to rising gas demand here. As the Deputy knows, there is a good deal of ongoing co-operation between both sides on energy matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agreed to put a more formal arrangement in place by way of regular ministerial meetings, supported by a working group of officials, which will meet formally on a regular basis with a view to building on the existing co-operation and <Col N="572" /> achieving the obvious synergies in the respective energy markets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie has been asking this question for some time. As I said when I met him informally, I could not help feeling, when I met Reg Empey today, that it is all beginning to happen. I thought it was common-sense history, and he agreed with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. She will agree it is a good sign that at this early stage of the Northern Ireland Executive, Reg Empey has come here for these discussions. Long may that continue and perhaps we will soon reach the stage where no one will pay much attention to these meetings. Co-operation in energy matters was not included in the implementation bodies or the other proposals for closer co-operation, not because there was no possibility of close co-operation but for political reasons. My question asked the Minister to itemise the opportunities for co-operation, but she only mentioned two or three.</P>
      <P>Would she care to elaborate on that? Does the Minister agree that, to a large extent, everything seems to be held up by the Corrib field? This cannot be allowed to continue forever. How long is it expected before we get sufficient information about the Corrib field to be able to take decisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Transport is one of the areas of mutual co-operation but energy is not. The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, Sir Reg Empey and I discussed the issue today and we came to the conclusion that while there is not an implementation body in this regard, the issue will elbow its way forward in any case. Today's meeting was a replacement for a meeting which was held when Sir Reg Empey was not in office &ndash; he was careful to emphasise that and I respect his wishes. It is practical and commonsensical that interconnectors would be updated. That will assist the ESB and it will assist competition because third parties, with the regulator on either side, will be able to gain access. That will be beneficial to the enhancement of competition and the increase of capacity.</P>
      <P>We should have an opinion on the commercial viability of the Corrib field prior to Christmas or shortly after it. The matter hinges on whether the field will be dealt with in a North-South, Wales-Ireland or Scotland-Ireland context. The commercial viability of the field will determine which of those will be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agenda 2010 relates to energy efficiency and environmentally friendly policies. We also held lengthy discussions on that. This area is just <Col N="573" /> beginning to flower and I believe people will quickly wonder why it did not form the basis of an implementation body or area of co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer that. It did not constitute one of the implementation bodies because it was decided that it would be adding too much to emphasise co-operation in energy and, for political reasons, that did not happen. Does the Minister agree that the quicker we find out about the commercial viability of the Corrib field, the better? She stated that we should have an opinion on that before Christmas. The Minister will then know the basis of the next question I will ask because she will not be answering questions again until after Christmas.</P>

      <Quest>the level of awareness by the RPII of nuclear installations worldwide in view of a report that one third of the USA's 103 nuclear power stations had to resolve their Y2K problems and a Reuters report which stated that the USA proposed stockpiling potassium iodide to prevent thyroid cancer caused by radioactive iodine releases; and if similar precautions have been taken in the interests of public safety here.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 38 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>Both the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and I are aware of the many concerns expressed worldwide in relation to the Y2K problem and its possible impact on the operation of nuclear facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency has played a leading role in facilitating the exchange of information and experience among member states as an essential component of its action plan for addressing the Y2K problem. The IAEA's initiative, along with similar initiatives undertaken by the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency and by the Commission of the European Communities has resulted in considerable work to ensure that nuclear facilities will not be adversely affected by the Y2K problem. It is clear that many facilities, including those in the USA, had to take measures to ensure safe operation of such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as nuclear facilities in the United Kingdom are concerned, I understand that the UK's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate expects all nuclear facilities to be Y2K compliant. The <Col N="574" /> RPII has been informed by British Nuclear Fuels that the nuclear fuel reprocessing plants at Sellafield will not be operating over the Christmas and new year period. This, I understand, is normal procedure at Sellafield for that time of year.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department and the RPII have raised the Y2K issue on a number of occasions with their UK counterparts. I also raised the matter in my meeting earlier this year with the then UK Minister of State for Energy and Industry, Mr. John Battle. The RPII is satisfied that the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate has set up a rigorous programme aimed at ensuring Y2K compliance by all operators of nuclear facilities in the UK.</P>
    <P>In the event of a nuclear accident abroad presenting a radiological hazard to Ireland, there is a well developed national emergency plan for nuclear accidents designed to provide a rapid response. The RPII also has contingency arrangements to address any emergency over the millennium period and will have the necessary staff on standby to activate the emergency plan if required.</P>
    <P>Under the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents, it is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children to maintain stocks of stable iodine tablets at health boards and to ensure there are plans in place for their rapid distribution. While such stocks are held at present by the health boards, the Department of Health and Children will keep under review the arrangements necessary to protect the health and safety of the public.</P>

An féidir leis an tAire a rá chomh maith cad go díreach atá i gceist ag an RPII le &ldquo;full alert&ldquo;? An bhfuilimid ag caint faoi iodine tablets amháin nó cad eile atá i gceist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not detected the complacency to which the Deputy referred in my dealings with the UK at ministerial level and with the RPII. On the contrary, when I placed this issue firmly on the agenda last May in my meeting with Mr. John Battle and his team of officials, I was assured that measures were in place to ensure that British nuclear plants would be Y2K compliant. As recently as last Thursday at a Council meeting in Brussels, I raised the issue again with the new UK Minister, Helen Liddell whom I met for the first time. We only had time to deal with one major issue and we discussed the Y2K matter. I was very happy with what Ms Liddell had to say. We are certainly not being complacent and are taking all the necessary precautions in regard to the national emergency plan. Ms Liddell <Col N="575" /> advised me that both she and the NII were comfortable with the situation.</P>

      <P>I advised the House previously that there are no safety standards in place in regard to the overcrowding of trains either in this country or at EU level. However, my Department's railway inspecting officers have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing their attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that an independent appraisal of the carrying capacity of its rolling stock is to be undertaken. I am very much aware of the discomfort passengers have experience due to overcrowding on trains in recent times.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of safety regulations, the Deputy will be aware of the independent review of railway safety undertaken last year. The review identified a number of options for the future regulation of railway safety in Ireland. A specific question on the regulatory framework has been put down for answer today and I will deal in full with this issue in my response to it.</P>

      <P>When I raised the question of an accident previously, the Minister said she could not give any guarantees that there will not be an accident even with the most sophisticated rail sys<Col N="576" /> tem in the world. It is indisputable that if there is an accident, a crash or derailment, the level of overcrowding on some trains &ndash; I instance DART, some suburban services and the weekend intercity services &ndash; is such that the carnage will be worse unless some regulations on overcrowding are introduced. Rather than leave the matter to Iarnród Éireann, which obviously wants the maximum revenue, the Minister should get her inspectors to look at the situation at peak morning commuting times because I have been told it is very frightening. Elderly and disabled people are frightened by the way they are compressed into carriages. Given the way the doors close, people are unsure of whether they will squeeze on. In the interest of public safety, the Minister should commission a study on this matter immediately and perhaps take an initiative at the EU Council of Ministers.</P>

Does she agree that where there is such overcrowding, CIE, Iarnród Éireann and so on do not maximise their revenue because they are not capable of collecting the fares given the conditions that exist?

CIE resists the idea of integrated ticketing, although it sits on a committee dealing with integrated ticketing. We got £1 million in the budget for the hardware for integrated ticketing and we will introduce it.

      <P>The light rail park and ride site at Tallaght will provide parking for 600 cars. There will be a 550 space park and ride site at the Red Cow. The availability of such parking will certainly promote the transfer of commuters from cars to public transport. There will also be a bus interchange at the Square in Tallaght to facilitate transfer from bus. From light rail usage in other countries, there is ample evidence to show that car drivers transfer to trams, considering them to be an attractive and practical alternative to city traffic congestion.

      <P>As I drove to Dublin over the past year, I thought it would be fantastic when the Luas came to Tallaght because I would be able to park the car there and head into town by train. However, I was in the centre in Tallaght on a Friday evening a few weeks ago and it is chaotic. In the meantime, I went through the reports and now realise CIE has a site in mind for parking. Perhaps that is the site to which the Minister referred in respect of the 600 car spaces. It strikes me that the Luas is for people from Tallaght and 600 spaces will not be enough to facili<Col N="578" /> tate people from west and south Wicklow, the Minister of State's consituency, and from Carlow and Naas. If I have to go through the difficulties I went through in Tallaght, I will certainly not use the facility.

      <P>The Government is not in a position to provide funding in the year 2000 for such a grant scheme due to other expenditure commitments. I will, however, keep the matter under review.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 10 on 29 June 1999, the Government has committed considerable resources to assessing the incidence of radon across the country. It also provided funds to the RPII to strengthen public awareness of the potential risk from radon in high radon areas. In my reply to that question and to Parliamentary Question No. 19 on 10 December 1998, I pointed out the various measures being taken by the Government to address the problem of high radon levels in new homes. In addition, along with the RPII, I have urged households in areas identified as high radon areas in the RPII national survey reports to contact the RPII with a view to having the radon levels in their homes assessed.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the importance of the matter raised by the Deputy, particularly public information about this gas and its potentially deleterious effects on people, especially those in established high radon areas. A ministerial committee I chair discusses these matters and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, who is <i>au fait</i> with the situation, is also a member. We discussed this matter at our most recent meeting and I asked the RPII to come back to the next meeting with proposals on how one might further improve the level of information on this issue that can be given to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">

We will debate it this evening during which I understand the Taoiseach will speak, but we will not debate it tomorrow or the day after. That is completely inadequate. Given that the whole country is debating the budget, the Dáil should debate it for the entire week. There are backbenchers in Fianna Fáil and in other parties who want to express their anger in this House. We should be allowed to debate this and nothing else for the entire week and, therefore, we will not agree this business.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I wish to raise a procedural issue in regard to the vote which has just been taken. The Government has lumped together proposals to take Supplementary Estimates without debate and Report Stage of a Bill without debate. My understanding of parliamentary procedure is that diverse proposals should not be lumped together in one proposition. It is a fundamental tenet of parliamentary procedure that each issue should be decided separately. I ask the Chair to ensure these proposals are not lumped together.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, the Fine Gael Party asked the Government to allow the Private Security Services Bill to be discussed in one week rather than two and the Government facilitated that request. During the vote that just took place, the Government voted for the request from Fine Gael and Fine Gael voted against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Taoiseach's plans in regard to items 38, 46 and 49? Does he propose that item 38, which relates to the budget and is being debated today for a paltry hour or two, will be debated tomorrow and, if not, why not? Will it be debated the following day and, if not, why not? Does the Taoiseach not think it strange that the budget is not being debated in the House this week when there is an organised procession of Fianna Fáil Deputies going to the plinth to give their views outside the House? It seems to be organised by somebody for some purpose, it is not spontaneous.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn was worried earlier that we might close down the budget debate. Item 46 relates to financial motions by the Minister for Finance for 1998 and item 49 relates to financial motions by the Minister for Finance for 1997. Both items are still on the Order Paper and they could be discussed as well. As far as I am concerned, we can continue to discuss the budget.</P>

      <P>As of now, less than two hours are scheduled for debate in plenary session. No other time is scheduled for debate on the budget. The Whips might discuss this tomorrow, but will the Taoiseach order extra time to debate the budget before the House adjourns? He rightly drew Members' attention to the fact that there will be no debate on it on the House's return and no definitive vote on it. The Chair properly ruled on 1 December that the House could not deviate from the strict terms of the resolutions which had to be voted on that day. For that reason Members want a definitive, inclusive vote on the content of the budget and more time than the less than two hours scheduled for debate.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most ambitious budgets in the history of the State. With the exception of some heavy smokers, everyone gains. It places a strong emphasis on social inclusion, as well as giving a more substantial reduction in the personal tax burden than it has ever been possible to do before. Many taxpayers on fairly average incomes will be at least £20 to £30 per week better off. The budget carries forward the process of radical tax reform. However, in mapping out a future modern tax system for those in the workforce, we will have to be attentive to the balance which needs to be preserved between spouses who work outside the home and spouses who bring up children or care for dependants at home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention. There has to be a sense of fairness, <i>vis-à-vis</i> not just carers in the home but the low-paid and other disadvantaged categories of the population, and it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure over the next period that resources are equitably distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before discussing some of the issues surrounding the budget, we need to remind ourselves how this year's budget builds on the success of the Irish economy, which has been at the top of the OECD charts through the 1990s. We are at the end of our sixth successive year of phenomenal growth. Unemployment is falling rapidly and, in <Col N="601" /><Col N="602" /> absolute numbers on the live register, is below 172,000. We have rolled it back to where it was in November 1982. However, relative to the hugely increased size of the labour force, the percentage of unemployed is now down to 5.1% and is likely to fall below 5% next year. Net employment is at its highest level ever and growing rapidly. It was less than 1.1 million in 1987. Next year it will be heading towards 1.7 million. There has been a dramatic reduction in the depth of poverty. The result of the buoyancy in growth and employment is that the Government finances are in their healthiest order ever, with the general Government debt-GDP ratio set to fall to 46% in the year 2000 and rapidly thereafter. We no longer have to borrow for capital investment. Apart from about £3 billion in EU funding, we are able to fund out of our own resources the major infrastructure programme in the national development plan costed at £41 billion and put money aside for the future funding of pensions. Last July, the OECD report on the Irish economy described us as a world leader in a number of aspects of economic performance, a performance which it described as &ldquo;peerless&rdquo;, contrasting it with the mid-1980s, when we were described as &ldquo;the sick man of western Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>None of this has happened of its own accord. The primary credit goes to the working people of the country, but there also had to be a positive policy framework. While there are long-term factors involved, including a consistent industrial policy over a period of 40 years and free secondary education introduced by Donogh O'Malley in the 1960s, there are more particular explanations for the vastly improved economic performance since 1987 and the phenomenal sustained growth experienced, beginning in 1993-94. I would list four factors in this regard. In 1987, a determined policy of financial stabilisation combined with social partnership against a favourable international background created a new confidence in the economy and soon had nearly all the indicators pointing in the right direction, setting up a virtuous circle. We successfully negotiated substantial Structural and Cohesion Funding over a 20 year period, for investment and social inclusion from the EU, with the two Delors packages and more recently Agenda 2000. When the public finances improved, we started to reform the tax system and lower the tax burden, while also strengthening the social safety net. While we lost the battle on devaluation we won the war, setting a credible exchange rate heading into EMU which saw Irish interest rates tumble. The impetus gave us a competitive momentum over a number of years, which was not lost through higher inflation. Finally, we have under this Government been able to prolong this unique period of high growth by prudent budgetary policies, controlling the growth of current expenditure and giving back to people more of what they pay in tax, far beyond what most parties envisaged as possible during the general election of 1997.</P>
    <P>The success that enables us make so many <Col N="603" /> improvements together has come because as a country we stopped putting the cart before the horse. Only if we drive economic development forward and provide proper work and business incentives will we generate the funds to tackle social exclusion more comprehensively. It is all about doing things in the right order and not assuming economic growth and competitiveness will take care of themselves while we spend and redistribute the fruits of labour.</P>
    <P>By virtually every criterion the budgetary policies of the Government have been spectacularly successful. Opposition leaders claim that when they were in Government they never had as much money available and that is of course true. However, they rarely acknowledge that it was the current Government and other Governments in which Fianna Fáil has participated since 1987 that have the largest share of responsibility at political level for creating the extra space and the extra resources.</P>
    <P>The social content of the budget is large: £485 million has been provided for additional social inclusion measures, going well beyond any previous package. Partnership 2000 committed the Government to spend £525 million on a full year cost basis over the three year period on social inclusion measures to protect the real value of social welfare payments during the period of the partnership. We have gone way beyond that. This year's budget on its own is only £40 million short of that target. The general social welfare increases, averaging 5.5%, should this year keep pace with the increase in average earnings, not just inflation. The old age contributory pension has been increased by £18 under this Government compared with half that amount during the three rainbow Government budgets. It will be worth well over £100 when we complete this term of office. Those who call the current £7 increase paltry have obviously forgotten the £1.80 given in 1995. Even on child benefit, which was the main focus then, we have done better this year with increases of £8 and £10.</P>
    <P>Those organisations who look after the mentally and physically handicapped are very pleased with this year's budget. Former Labour Party adviser Fergus Finlay, who has a special interest in the sector, wrote in <i>The Examiner</i> on Thursday that the Minister had done &ldquo;a tremendous day's work under that heading&rdquo;. The director of REHAB has called it &ldquo;a major breakthrough&rdquo; and &ldquo;a message of hope for the many thousands of people with disabilities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The centrepiece of any budget is changes in taxation. No one can dispute that the £942 million given in tax relief far exceeds any given in the last three budgets. We have already, at the end of three years, reached the upper range of where we considered we could be in terms of the overall cost of tax packages at the time of the last general election.</P>
    <P>We have acknowledged the importance of increasing tax-free allowances, which was one of the arguments made at the last election. Our <Col N="604" /> introduction of the tax credit system has ensured that disproportionate benefit no longer leaks up to those on the top of the scale. The tax-free allowances have been increased by £1,800 for a single person and double that for a married couple over our three budgets. This compares with a total of £550 or just under a third in the three rainbow Government budgets. The tax free allowance now stands at £4,700, which will take 50,000 out of the tax net. The proposal to introduce a minimum wage was also an initiative of this Government.</P>
    <P>Fulfilling the mandate given by the people is an important principle. We promised the electorate we would cut tax rates, and we have done so by 4% on each rate or 8% in all since 1997. This compares with a 1% reduction only in the standard rate during the period of the rainbow coalition.</P>
    <P>There is bipartisan agreement across the House on the necessity and desirability of cutting corporation tax rates to 12.5% which has had a huge spin-off in terms of stimulating business. Corporation tax revenue will have almost doubled from just under £1.7 billion in 1997 to over £3 billion in 2000, in the space of just three years. The Minister for Finance said how revenue from his heavily contested halving of capital gains tax in 1997 has increased from £132 million to £343 million. How is it that we are prepared to cut business tax rates, essentially for the sake of the economy, but are resistant to cutting them for the hardworking people on PAYE ?</P>
    <P>The most controversial part of the budget by far has been the plan to implement the other plank of our tax policy, which is to reduce drastically the numbers paying tax at the higher rate to 20% or less. We are taking 125,000 out of the top tax rate this coming year. It goes a long way towards acknowledging the additional costs of child care for families where both parents work outside the home. It is fundamentally inequitable that many newcomers to the workforce, who are young single people, should have to pay the higher rate of tax at below the average industrial wage. That situation has been condemned for years on all sides of the House, but until this year not much that is effective has been done about it. The current tax system also clearly discourages the married woman in particular from a return to work outside the home by in most cases imposing over 50% deductions on her pay. If one adds to that in many instances the cost of child care and other costs, it may simply not be worth her while working. What we can do to help those at work is severely constrained if the bands have to be doubled, regardless of circumstance.</P>
    <P>The concept of individualisation of tax bands, for which there are strong equity arguments, is contained in an ESRI booklet published last October on budget options and in an interdepartmental report published last August on the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare systems. The Combat Poverty Agency, in a statement issued <Col N="605" /> last Thursday supported individualisation and restriction of the transferability of bands, but urged a series of accompanying measures. I accept the view of the president of Congress that the context of the change is as important as the principle of it.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy in recent years, recognising the huge social changes that have taken place, has been to balance support for the carer in the home and the right to gender equality in the workforce. The current system is weighted against the spouse who chooses to work outside the home. I would point out that the budget has introduced a much needed carer's benefit, but that is just one necessary step. This is only the third of five budgets, and how we achieve the necessary balance over the remainder in broad terms will be a subject of both political discussion in the Government and negotiation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, which has been loudest in its opposition to the change, proposed something with a similar effect in its recent economic policy document. One of its aims was also to reduce the number of persons who pay tax at the higher rate &ldquo;so that women at home are encouraged to rejoin the labour force&rdquo;. Fine Gael proposed to introduce an earned income tax credit, which would, to use its words, produce &ldquo;tax reductions at different levels of income for single, married one earner and married two earner taxpayers&rdquo;. A married couple both of whom are earners, for example, would save substantially more tax than the one earner couple. What is more, in footnotes Fine Gael states that its policies are not negotiable with the social partners, only the timing. I would like to suggest in the light of this document that the furore created by the Fine Gael leader is arrant bluster and hypocrisy. Fine Gael is overtly trying to push married women at home out into the workforce, whereas the budget simply sought to remove the positive discouragement to workforce participation contained in our current tax system. It is important to note that despite a strong impression to the contrary Fine Gael is also promoting a differentiation between one earner and two earner couples.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the real concerns which have been expressed about the budget plans regarding the method chosen to achieve a major widening of the band. I thank all those people who have contacted me and who have expressed their points of view to my colleagues over the past few days. Of course, we listen to what they say and try to take account of it to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>The Government has no desire to dictate personal choices to any group of citizens, least of all to the family. Our objective is, as far as possible, to provide a level playing field in terms of fundamental fairness, equality of opportunity and personal freedom of choice, but we also have to respond to social change. If we accept that people should pay tax in their own right, especially above a certain income level, at an effective rate proportionate to their income, it is for further discussion the level of relief that is appropriate to <Col N="606" /> take account of any individual or couple's domestic or family circumstances, and the supportive measures that are necessary to support such a change, particularly when it goes further down the road.</P>
    <P>In launching the negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000, I made clear that the Government accepts the analysis in the recent National Economic and Social Council strategy report which, <i>inter alia</i>, attaches a high priority to increases in personal allowances and significant priority also to increasing the level at which people become liable for the higher rate, and the need for measures other than the increase in child benefit to address the issue of child care availability and supply. I underlined my belief that the vision in the NESC report can be made a reality. I equally underlined the Government's view that implementation requires a realistic approach to the pace at which progress can be made and a sense of balance between the various elements of the vision. The budget came at an unusual point in the course of the negotiations. The norm has been that budgets have come after the conclusion of the negotiation of particular agreements and can be clearly seen in perspective. The budget contains much that has been rightly welcomed, in particular in reversing the discrimination suffered up to now by single workers who entered the higher tax bracket far too soon, and by married couples who both worked outside the home and whose additional burdens because of that had not been recognised.</P>
    <P>Because it is one budget, it has not been possible to identify clearly or fully the balance that is essential, in particular for carers who work at home, and to underpin our ongoing commitment to those who are the least well off.</P>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity today to say that the Government will take steps over the remainder of its term to ensure the necessary balance in the implementation of Government policy. We will be listening carefully to proposals put forward in the negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has just stated that all members of Fianna Fáil are elected and they will speak, in the social partnership negotiations, for those who are most adversely affected by this budget, namely, the men and women who are doing unpaid work in the home and those who are on low pay who are not getting a sufficient exemption from tax. While it is the case that the trade union movement represents those on low pay, although many of them are not members of unions, unfortunately for them, there is no way in which it can be said that any of the social partners who are participating in the negotiations represent men and women working on an unpaid basis in the home. They are not represented in any of the discussion groups taking part in the negotiations. For the Taoiseach to say that members of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats represent them is false. In the last election Fianna Fáil proposed that it would tilt the tax balance in the opposite direction to what the budget is now doing. Fianna Fáil proposed that an additional tax free allowance would be given to people in the home so that those one income families would have a more generous tax treatment on a given level of income than would a two income family to the extent of an allowance of £2,000. So to the extent that the Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House have any mandate, it is a mandate that goes in the opposite direction on this point to the one the Government is now pursuing.</P>
      <P>The principal difficulty the Government faces in trying to introduce individualisation is that it has no mandate from the people for this. The introduction of individualisation into our tax system is a profound change by any standard. It is so profound a change that the people deserve to have been consulted about it. It is profoundly dishonest for Fianna Fáil to come in here, given that its election manifesto committed it to tilt the balance in one direction, to move dramatically in the direct opposite direction and it is a negation of democracy. It is not democratic to go in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also remind Fianna Fáil, which is, to its credit, the authors of our Constitution, that the approach it is now taking in introducing individualisation goes against the letter and the spirit of our Constitution. The Constitution, in particular Article 41, does not look on Ireland as a nation solely of individuals. It looks on Ireland as a nation of families as well as a nation of individ<Col N="609" /> uals and the recognition is given in the Constitution to the authority and the separateness of each family in the way they decide to distribute their resources. There is no mandate in the Constitution for individualisation, for treating families differently depending on the choices they make within their family structure. Under the Constitution, the authority of the family to make decisions as to who should or should not go out to work is recognised.</P>
    <P>If a family has infant twins, for example, and the mother has to stay at home for one, two or three years to look after those children, is the Minister for Finance saying that he has a right under the Constitution to penalise that family, because they are a one income family, and ask them to pay more tax than a two income family would pay with the same income? I believe he does not have the constitutional authority to do that. The issue of whether a mother or a father should stay at home to look after twins or triplets is a decision for the family under the Constitution, and no tax incentive should be introduced which undermines the authority of the family to make that decision.</P>
    <P>Likewise, a family with four children, one of whom is a profoundly disturbed teenager who may have behavioural problems at school or who may be getting in difficulty with the law, might decide that the father, who can manage the teenager slightly better, should take two or three years off work while the son is going through the particularly difficult teenage period when he might be at risk of breaking the law so that he can be home in the evening when the teenager comes in and will be able to keep an eye on what he does. A family has the perfect authority, under our Constitution, to make that decision for itself and I do not believe it is constitutional, let alone politically wise, for the Minister for Finance to introduce a tax disincentive which penalises a family because it decides, in its own interests, that one partner &ndash; in this case the father &ndash; should stay at home to look after a particular child or children. The Minister for Finance has not any right, under the law or in terms of political authority, to make the change he is making to adversely affect such a family, because it was not put to the people and it is not allowed under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I will refer to another situation which may occur in a family. A father and mother could both work and earn a good income but the grandmother could become ill and require care. The family may decide that it does not wish to put the grandmother into long-term care because she is not accustomed to being away from her family and that one of the couple will stay at home to look after her. A family is entitled to make such a decision. From the perspective of IBEC and the economists, that the mother may withdraw from the workforce to look after her mother-in-law could be perceived to constitute a loss of a valuable trained resource and could cause difficulty for the company which employs her. However, <Col N="610" /> there is a more serious value here than the company's interests, namely the interest and the right of the family to make what it considers to be the best decision. One of the partners should be able to withdraw from the workforce to look after an elderly relative without suffering a tax penalty. I do not believe the Government has any right, moral, political or constitutional, to introduce individualisation in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The current treatment of married couples, which treats couples equally, regardless of whether they are in a single or double income family, derives from the Constitution. A Government must always act in accordance with the Constitution. It is regrettable that the Government has a view of society which is so driven by monetary and business concerns and companies' ambitions to make profits. This Government is blind to all work which is not paid work. Anyone who could introduce a tax penalty for unpaid work in the home is blind to all work other than work for which payment is made. This Government does not believe that unpaid work carried out by someone in the home counts. Because it does not figure in GDP figures or company balance sheets, it does not count in the eyes of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Ministers for Finance tend to move in certain types of company. They tend to meet the managing directors of companies more often than they meet carers of elderly people or parents of disturbed children. They may well receive more coherent economic analyses from the managing directors of companies than from carers of elderly people or of disturbed children. They may receive more polished budget submissions from managing directors than from carers or people with more than three or four children who must stay at home to look after them. Parents who stay at home are obviously not in a position to produce slide shows and other presentations through which they can dazzle the Minister for Finance with their professionalism. Neither are they able to afford the assistance of lobbyists. However, their case is still a valid one.</P>
    <P>I was very saddened by the omission in the Taoiseach's speech where he spoke about reconsidering this matter in the context of negotiations with the social partners. This Government does not regard parents in the home as social partners. Those parents are &ldquo;non-persons&rdquo; in the eyes of this Government. People are merely looking for equality. I am not advocating that people who stay at home should receive any more than those who go out to work but people should be treated equally across the board.</P>

      <P>In regard to Deputy Bruton's recent comments, Fine Gael proposed to introduce an earned income tax credit which would <Col N="611" /> produce &ldquo;tax reductions at different levels of income for single, married &ndash; one earner and married &ndash; two earners taxpayers.&rdquo;. For example, a married couple in which there was two earners would save substantially more tax than a couple in which there was just one earner.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to understand how a Government could have got it so terribly wrong. This Government has more funds available to it than any previous Government. It has shown such political incompetence that not only has it made women &ndash; those who are already at home or those who would like the option to look after their children at home &ndash; feel trapped and undervalued, it has also succeeded in aggravating the largest trade union in the country by the mean-minded manner in which it has treated the low paid.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, was kind enough to draw attention to Fine Gael's proposals, one of which is that all workers earning less than the minimum wage of £170 per week would not pay any tax at all. This Government has only raised the threshold, below which people would not pay any tax, from £100 to £110. That says all that needs to be said about the difference between Fianna Fáil and this side of the House. This side of the House stands for social justice. Fianna Fáil stands for those who are already well off. The budget drawn up by &ldquo;K Club Charlie&rdquo; represents the values of the K Club &ndash; privilege, congratulating oneself on one's golf handicap, the number of times one is able to take a holiday each year and the turbo charged power of one's fourth motor car. Those thrusting, profit seeking values have colonised Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some would say that Fianna Fáil is a party which had a revolutionary past; it certainly had a past of social radicalism. The party is still a radical one but in a very different way. Where it was <Col N="612" /> radical in the past on behalf of those who had little, it is now radical on behalf of people, many of whom already have far too much.</P>

      <P>A number of people in this Chamber have had the honour to be Minister for Finance &ndash; the present Minister is not here and I hope that does not augur badly for his future prospects &ndash; but of the other two, including myself, it is fair to say that no Minister for Finance had the opportunity to make such an impact on society as the present incumbent. The sheer scale of the amount of money that still remains with this Government is an indication of how extraordinarily well-equipped was this Minister.</P>
      <P>The current budget surplus that happened by accident when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, left office in December 1994 was a mere £50 million. It was not planned for but was very welcome. This year the current budget surplus projected for the year 2000 will be £4.85 billion. That is the scale of economic transformation that has come about. To refer to increases of certain volumes of money as if they were dramatically bigger than what was there in previous years misses the big picture. This country is no longer poor. The State is no longer impoverished. For years people were told the resources were not available to achieve what they wished but that is no longer true. In addition to that surplus, money will be put into a pension fund, the concept of which we support, although how it will be utilised has not been specified. Against this background of wealth and opportunity the country is up in arms at the manner in which the Government has bungled the greatest financial opportunity this century.</P>

      <P>It is incomprehensible to the ordinary punter in the street and to commentators who have looked in amazement at how this Government got it so wrong. Perhaps they should look at the track record of the Minister in question. This is the man who gave us the dirty dozen, who outraged the nation in his first budget and had to be rowed back to ensure the terms and conditions of Partnership 2000 which had not been negotiated by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats could be put back on course. He has been let loose again and what has he produced? In the words of Colm Rapple, it is closer to Thatcher than to Dev. He is right. What is frightening is this was not a mistake. Deputy McCreevy did not make a gaff. He believes this kind of distortion and that is why we are so opposed to this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A budget is about establishing priorities. As I said in my first budget speech in 1995, it reflects choices and affirms values. It is an indication of the type of society we want for ourselves over the next 12 months and beyond and it contains some <Col N="613" /> at least of the means to bring that about. The budget is only part of the overall picture. The estimates, which we waved through earlier today, contain the vast bulk of the spending. The additional amounts of money indicated on the day of the budget are quite small. What has the Government done? Perhaps last Friday night the Taoiseach gave an indication of the philosophy that animates Fianna Fáil. At the Cáirde Fáil dinner in the Burlington Hotel he said Fianna Fáil intends that this country would move towards a low tax, high enterprise society that generates ample resources to fund better public services and more comprehensive social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Where have the tax breaks started? We have resources on a scale such as we never had before but instead of taking people earning under £10,000 a year &ndash; which is just over the minimum wage now projected to be at £170 per week &ndash; out of the tax net which the Minister could have done and which could have been a strong platform for negotiating a successor to Partnership 2000, he gratuitously took 2% off the top rate and 2% off the standard rate and did not seriously affect the low paid in any meaningful way. If this budget goes through in its current form, and I doubt it will, there are many people whose incomes will not be substantially affected at a time when they could have expected a substantial alteration.</P>
    <P>On that basis this budget should be rejected. It should be returned out of the House by the backbenchers who support the Taoiseach and who have been going to the plinth at the behest of his office, it is alleged, certainly at the behest of the Fianna Fáil press office, to undermine support for this budget. The one concession the Taoiseach made in his speech this evening was when he said: &ldquo;I acknowledge the real concerns that have been expressed in many quarters about the budget plans in regard to the method chosen to achieve a widening of the band. The Government has no desire to dictate personal choices to any group of citizens and least of all the family.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is rubbish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the budget does. The Taoiseach has, <i>de facto</i>, dictated a choice and he has kept people in the tax net when he could have removed them from it. This budget will not bring equity into the system or advance the equality agenda of our society. The Taoiseach should listen to people such as the Combat Poverty Agency who said the bottom 10% of the population who need it most and are dependant on the State more than any other sector got an increase of 0.7% and the top 30% who need it least got between 3% and 4% of what they already have. Where is the justice in that? Was this the view from the swimming pool in the south of France? Was this how Ireland looked from that happy tax-free corner of the world? What kind of values are animating the Fianna Fáil Party when this is <Col N="614" /> allowed to happen? And happen it has at a time of unprecedented wealth.</P>
      <P>There are many other items in this budget that have slipped through because of the furore about the assault on the low paid. As Deputy McDowell rightly said, the Minister has responded to the understandable concern of people about being forced out of the family home if one of their parents died and they inherited. He said that if people can demonstrate they have been living there for a number of years no tax would be payable on the family home. I welcome that. But from where did they get the mandate to unilaterally make all CAT taxable at 20%? From what article of republican faith that is left in Fianna Fáil did that free present for the wealthy in society come? We will deal with all the other provisions that are set out in the CAT when the time comes. This is a wealthy person's budget at a time when they are already wealthy and at a time when we had an opportunity within our grasp to eliminate poverty, adult illiteracy, homelessness and so on. Instead, what the Minister for Finance has done at the behest, we can only presume, of the Progressive Democrats wing of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government is to drive him into this particular approach and he said he will come back and look at it.</P>
      <P>I will make a prediction that the budget in its present form will not be the one enacted by the Finance Bill when it comes to the floor of this House some time in February or March of next year. I would prefer if we had the opportunity to vote on it now and not wait for the distorted and bastardised form which will arise. For that reason, I wish to formally move, under Standing Order 64, that the motion on this matter be now taken.</P>

      <P>We live in a time of extraordinary economic and social potential. Standards of living have been rising for most of those in employment and income per head will reach average EU levels soon. While accepting and rejoicing in the good news story, we must not forget those who are not doing well or who are not benefiting to any great extent from our buoyant economy.</P>
      <P>Successive UN human development reports have highlighted the reality of poverty in Ireland. In 1999, a report by the UN again highlighted that among industrialised countries only the US has a higher percentage of its population in poverty. A substantial number of people live in poverty in this country. The number of long-term unemployed is still problematic and access to appropriate accommodation is becoming more difficult for large numbers of people. Adult illiteracy levels remain a scandal and the drop-out rate from second level education is storing up problems for the future. We have to view this budget against this background.</P>
      <P>The budget introduced by this Government is socially divisive and politically inept. No Government has had resources at its disposal on budget day which the Government had. Yet it failed to address the real needs of all the people. Low paid persons received very little from the budget &ndash; £4 per week on an income of £10,000. There is nothing special about the provisions for old age pensioners, widows or widowers and child benefit has increased by only £2 per week for the first and third child. There are no effective provisions for child care. As Fr. Sean Healy of CORI stated, this budget is anti-family, anti-children, anti-women and anti-poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to individualise the standard rate tax band is a travesty. When the Minister's scheme is fully implemented a family on one income will move to the higher rate of tax when its income exceeds £28,000 while a family on two <Col N="616" /> incomes will not move to the higher rate until their incomes exceed £56,000. This approach to taxation reveals a Government which believes it is running an economy rather than a country. It believes society should be based on individuals rather than on families or communities and this matter was borne out in last Sunday's editorial in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. It confirmed, more or less, the sentiments expressed by Deputy Noonan in his budget speech.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI analysed the distribution impact of this budget. It said that in budget 2000, the richest 10% of households will benefit six times more than the poorest 10% of households which will benefit from a 0.7 % increase in income. The richest 10% will benefit from a 4.2% increase in income while the middle 20% of households will benefit by an average of 2%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy, Flood and Jacob.</P>
      <P>In the present controversy, we seem to overlook that everyone has gained in budget 2000 and that nobody has lost; some have gained more than others. This Government has looked beyond the immediate and is planning towards a better future for all. We are addressing the needs of pensioners, carers and people whose circumstances depend on Government support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget does not stand alone. It is part of a structured plan of a Government determined to bring a better quality of life to every citizen. More importantly, the Minister for Finance's three <Col N="617" /> budgets all contained measures designed to improve the position of older people in our society as regards pensions. In An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government promised it would bring the old age pension up to £100 per week over the lifetime of this Government. This commitment has been emphatically delivered on. This latest budget provides for a £7 increase in the personal rate of pensions for people over 66 years and for those over 65 years on retirement and invalidity pensions. This follows on the unprecedented 5% increase in the Minister's first budget and a further £6 increase in his second budget. People with selective political memories should not be allowed to forget that it was not so long ago, 1995 in fact, that Deputy De Rossa, as Minister for Social Welfare, gave pensioners a meagre £1.80 increase.</P>
    <P>The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is that the rate of old age contributory pension will stand at £96 per week. This represents a 20% increase on the rate payable when the Government came into office compared with a total increase of under 10% over the lifetime of the rainbow coalition. Under the rainbow coalition, old age pensions stood still compared to the growth in earnings. This Government has increased them well above the increase in average earnings. When the increase in qualified adult payment is included, a contributory old age pensioner couple, both over the age of 66, will receive £166.60 per week from next May compared with £133.40 in 1997.</P>
    <P>This Government has also significantly improved the assistance available to those with disabilities. I would single out the measures contained in the budget that address the needs of those with an intellectual disability. Additional Revenue funding of £35 million has been made available to provide hundreds of new residential, respite and day places as well as focusing on office and support services and additional specialist support services. This is just one part of an overall package for people with disabilities spread across a number of Departments and illustrates the Government's commitment to improving the lot of all sectors of society.</P>
    <P>It is the Opposition's duty to criticise and oppose. Democracy is strengthened by strong effective Opposition and the Opposition parties have targeted, as the Opposition always does, perceived weaknesses in the budget. If I was in Opposition I would do the same; I would concentrate on attack. If I was working in public service journalism I would not, nor should I. I have been a strong supporter of RTE, our public service broadcaster, at all times and have always respected its independence. When representations or complaints are made to me regarding programmes transmitted by the station, I respond by pointing out that programming is a matter for RTE. It is not my function as Minister to intervene in programming matters and it is only right in a democracy that that is the case. Yet there have been times when I, as a viewer, have been <Col N="618" /> personally annoyed or infuriated by something I have seen or heard on RTE or when I have disagreed with the interpretation of a particular story. Those responses fall within the normal diversity of reactions to the normal diversity of opinions, analysis and programming one would expect from the national public service broadcaster. The functions and responsibilities of journalism in public service broadcasting in this country are to provide objective and impartial reporting of the news of the day. It is the duty of the RTE Authority to ensure its current affairs programming is fair to all interests concerned and is presented in an objective and impartial manner, in accordance with the Broadcasting Authority Acts. In this respect the Authority has the responsibility to ensure its national broadcasting services are not used as a platform for the expression of personal views by any of its employees on any topic.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the budget that impacts on my Department is the section 481 provision, which has proven to be a fundamental instrument of Government policy in the development of the film industry in Ireland. First established as section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, the scheme was reviewed on a three-yearly basis up to 1999. At that time, the film industry strategic review group, chaired by Mr. O.J. Kilkenny, had issued an interim report recommending the continuation of the section 481 scheme. However, in anticipation of the group's final report, the Minister for Finance agreed to extend the scheme for a year up to April 2000. However, some people read this as signalling not an interim arrangement but a preparation for the withdrawal of section 481 altogether in the year 2000. Section 481 has enabled Irish film producers to establish themselves and develop the international relationships which are essential to this industry. A small number of major international projects have also been attracted to Ireland, providing opportunities for Irish professionals to work alongside world class international technical and creative talents. These projects have given Ireland wide international publicity as a venue and centre of excellence in film making.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny report was published last August and I moved quickly to put proposals based on its recommendations to the Government. The Government approved my proposals and I will shortly give a composite statement setting out the strategic plan for the industry. I warmly welcome the provision in the budget which will extend the section 481 investment incentive scheme for five years. This will strongly underpin the strategic plan and I am satisfied these steps will put in place a policy framework for the new decade and offer an unprecedented period of confidence and stability for the industry. This commitment to extend the measure for five years will send a powerful signal to both the Irish and international film and investment communities that Ireland is committed, in the long-term, to film production. It will also help to stabilise career options for <Col N="619" /> those entering the workforce for the first time and for those seeking to transfer their skills to this sector. However, I stress that it is for the industry to avail of these opportunities in a constructive and strategic way. I am confident that progressive elements in the industry will realise and seize this opportunity for consolidation and growth which the five year extension of section 481 and a co-ordinated strategic plan for the industry will provide. There is a real danger that negative attitudes within the industry itself will be only to the detriment of the industry here. While I do not expect comment to be uncritical, there is no doubt a pervasively negative tone is no good for the industry and undermines international confidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party has never been afraid to give taxpayers back more of their hard-earned money. In three budgets we have been part of a Government that has given back more than £2 billion to taxpayers. We have addressed some of the key concerns of employees and employers alike and have sought to take real measures towards the creation of a fairer society. Amid all the controversy, it is too easy to forget the huge gains for ordinary workers, the record increase in the old age pension, the record increase in child benefit and the record amount now being spent to improve the plight of people with disabilities, both physical and intellectual, in this budget.</P>
      <P>I am proud that the Progressive Democrats Party has made an input into taking the burden of tax off the workers of this country like never before. Clearly, as we develop a fair and reasonable tax system for a modern workforce, we must seek to balance the needs of spouses who work outside the home and spouses who rear their children or care for other dependants in the home. My party is also committed to easing the tax burden on the low paid and it should be noted that in its three budgets to date and within a space of less than two years, this Government has raised the level at which workers enter the tax net from £71 to £110. Much more needs to be done and my colleagues and I accept this; it is our firm intention to do so in forthcoming budgets.</P>
      <P>This is only the third of five budgets and I fully support the initiative to take more than 80% of people out of the top rate of tax by the year 2002. This Government's ambitious plans are a far cry from the mere tinkering with tax which was carried on by the Labour and Fine Gael rainbow coalition when it was in office a short time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If further evidence was needed that housing is right at the top of this Government's agenda, the budget and the Estimates provisions for next year provide it. Significantly increased resources have been provided in this budget to improve the housing conditions of those who are most in need, including the disabled, the elderly and the home<Col N="620" /> less. The housing provisions include significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grant scheme; a substantial increase in the effective maximum grant available under the essential repairs grant scheme; extra funding for the provision of hostel accommodation for the homeless; an additional £1 million funding for the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly; substantially increased funding for the Irish Council for Social Housing which will support the drive to increase output from the voluntary housing sector; and tax changes which will not only simplify the tax code in relation to housing but will further encourage the sale of land for housing and help to develop and encourage stability of tenure in the private rented sector.</P>
    <P>The disabled persons grant scheme is a well-targeted scheme which enables local authorities to grant aid necessary adaptation works to a house to meet the needs of a disabled person. The terms and conditions of the scheme were significantly improved in last year's budget and I am pleased that this year we have gone even further. The effective maximum grant paid by local authorities was increased from £12,000 to £14,000 and very significantly, the grant can now cover up to 90% of the cost of the works, compared to 75% previously.</P>
    <P>The essential repairs grant scheme, which again is administered by local authorities, enables basic repairs to be carried out to certain houses so that they can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. The effective maximum grant under this scheme has been increased to £6,000 from £4,500. In total, an extra £5.7 million has been provided in the budget for disabled persons and essential repairs grants next year.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly is specifically designed to enable elderly persons living on their own to enjoy decent housing conditions. It provides for the carrying out, at no cost to the occupier, of basic works to prolong the useful life of the house so that it can continue to provide, for as long as is necessary, an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. In addition to the £1 million increase in funding provided for the task force in the Abridged Estimates for 2000, a further £1 million has been allocated in the budget, bringing the total provision for the scheme in 2000 to £8 million &ndash; the highest level of funding ever provided to the task force and twice the level of expenditure on the scheme in 1997.</P>
    <P>The budget also provides a significant boost to the funding available for homelessness. High support accommodation for homeless people with addictions is a critical element of our range of responses to homelessness. The Government has recognised this by providing £5 million over the next two years to enable Dublin Corporation to provide two high support hostels for homeless people suffering from addictions. This is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to respond effectively to the needs of homeless <Col N="621" /> people and is additional to the provision of £4 million contained in next year's Estimates for the provision by local authorities of hostel accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Irish Council for Social Housing, the umbrella organisation for voluntary housing bodies, will be allocated £150,000 towards its running costs for next year. This increased funding will enable the ICSH to enhance its developmental role and to meet additional administrative and other costs, which inevitably will arise from the Government's drive to increase output from the voluntary housing sector to 4,000 units per annum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes to the tax code introduced in the budget with direct benefits for housing, particularly the assistance provided to those living in private rented accommodation. The amount of rent relief available against income tax has been increased by 50% for single, widowed and married people who can currently claim relief at the standard rate. In addition, the exemption threshold for stamp duty payable on residential leases has been increased from £6,000 to £15,000.</P>
    <P>The changes announced to mortgage interest relief will assist widowed people, simplify the system and ease the burden of mortgage repayments for many house purchasers. In particular, the introduction of mortgage interest relief at source will mean that from April 2001 borrowers will have the benefit of making only net &ndash; after tax relief &ndash; payments on their home purchase loans.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a 20% rate of tax on the sale of residential land for companies and individuals who would have been liable for higher rates previously will further encourage the release of land for residential development. This is a helpful change in the context of the Government's drive to increase housing supply. The significant reductions in income tax generally announced in the budget will increase every household's disposable income and will greatly assist affordability of house purchase or rental for those aspiring to set up homes.</P>
    <P>The housing measures contained in the budget have been carefully targeted at those in our society who are most in need, but by no means do they tell the full story regarding the Government's investment in housing. The increased expenditure in the budget will bring total housing expenditure to more than £800 million in 2000 &ndash; an increase of 50% on last year's Estimate. Furthermore, local authority and social housing programmes will be allocated £432 million &ndash; an increase of 60% &ndash; to enable local authorities to meet existing commitments as well as providing for an enhanced programme of 22,000 local authority housing units under the four year multiannual programme due to commence in January next year. I recently advised local authorities of their starts for the years of the multiannual programme. I urged them to immediately commence the preparation of schemes to ensure a streamlined delivery of housing output over the four year period. I have also asked the authorities to <Col N="622" /> front-load their programmes as far as possible where local authority housing needs have increased significantly.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of housing in the National Development Plan for the first time also reflects the priority that the Government has given to this issue. The provision of £6 billion, which averages more than £850 million per annum over the life of the plan, is more than double the £2.4 billion invested in housing over the period of the previous plan. The £6 billion housing investment will ensure the social housing needs of more than 90,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>Such levels of investment represent a real response to current housing need and clearly demonstrate that housing is one of the Government's top priorities. Our housing programme will continue to focus on action &ndash; action on behalf of all those who have a housing need.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget. RTE's coverage of the budget last Wednesday was outside the station's remit of objective and impartial reporting and analysis. We witnessed a hysterical rant against the budget, which made the Opposition appear almost pro-budget. In attacking the budget, the members of the Opposition were doing their job, but some RTE employees were not. Elements of this budget have proven to be controversial, but my concerns about some RTE coverage are in no way related to that specific controversy. In certain instances RTE did not meet its obligations and that would be my belief if this budget had not raised a ripple of controversy. I am bitterly disappointed at the way some of RTE's coverage and analysis of &ldquo;Budget 2000&rdquo; veered to the highly individualist rather than the impartial.</P>
      <P>As I drove about doing my work as a Minister of State last week, I had the opportunity to listen to some of the phone-in shows on RTE radio. I am very concerned about one presenter who almost invited a caller to vote against Fianna Fáil or to go out and march. That did not represent fair and impartial management by the radio station in regard to that show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time of unprecedented economic growth with labour shortages in several areas, social inclusion remains a crushing problem in many of the disadvantaged communities. At a time of economic boom, this may widen the poverty gap due to the weak capacity of the socially marginalised to meet the increasingly sophisticated demands of employment. For that reason the Government will make a major investment, totalling more than £14 billion to address social inclusion. Of that sum, £1 billion will be spent via the regional operational programmes in a special sub-programme for social inclusion and of that sum £420 million will be directed to continue and augment the valuable work carried out under the <Col N="623" /> aegis of my Department by the area based partnership companies, the community groups, local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund. This provision represents a 50% increase over the levels of expenditure available to existing programmes in these fields.</P>
    <P>The existing partnership programmes under the operational programme for local, urban and rural development have made significant achievements in combating social exclusion and disadvantage. For example, up to the end of 1998 some 24,000 people were assisted to obtain employment or to set themselves up in employment and some 35,000 young people have been assisted under preventative education measures. Further area based intervention programmes will build on these successes in providing outreach to long-term unemployed people participating in second chance education and training initiatives and in dealing with the important issue of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The national drugs initiative established in 1997 has achieved a considerable degree of success in combating the scourge of drugs that affects many urban areas. The primary focus of the national drugs strategy has been on the areas experiencing the highest levels of heroin abuse and this focus will continue in the years to come. The Government has invested considerable resources across a range of agencies to tackle the drug problem. For example, £10 million was allocated in 1997 over and above the funding available to the State agencies to support the implementation of action plans, which were prepared by the task forces, and a further £15 million was allocated over the following two years to enable those plans to be updated.</P>
    <P>The young people's facilities and services fund was established by the Government in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to exist.</P>
    <P>An Exchequer contribution of more than £34 million has been provided over a three year period for this purpose, of which £25 million has been targeted by the Government at the 13 local drugs task force areas to support almost 300 projects as part of the integrated plans prepared locally.</P>
    <P>We recognise the drugs problem is not confined to the task force areas in Dublin and Cork city and the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion provided £2.3 million to urban areas outside the task force areas where a serious drugs problem exists or has the potential to develop. The primary focus initially on the major urban areas include Galway, Limerick, south Cork city, Waterford, Bray and Carlow.</P>
    <P>The funding provided in the national development plan must be taken into account when analysing the budget as both will lay the foundations <Col N="624" /> from which the country will build future growth and prosperity in the millennium. Social inclusion has been correctly signalled as a fundamental issue in the plan that needs to be achieved if all our citizens are to reap the benefits of the country's economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for appropriate structures to be put in place at local level to optimise the benefits that will come from the new programmes. Careful planning will be required to integrate the work of the various agencies and to achieve the best use of resources, both financial and human. I strongly urge all the relevant Departments to use the experience and expertise derived from initiatives, such as the integrated services process, in the planning and delivery of the new programmes.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 stated that social inclusion would be a strategic objective in its own right. The targeted initiatives taken and the relevant programmes developed over a wide range of areas for the period of Partnership 2000, underpinned by an allocation of resources almost double what was promised, confirms the Government's commitment to tackling disadvantage. The disadvantaged individuals, families, children and communities continue to pose a collective challenge for us and we will be rightly judged as a caring society by the adequacy of our response.</P>
    <P>Our objective is to ensure that the most vulnerable sections in our society get their fair share of the benefits in our successful economy. We have made significant progress towards achieving that objective, which this budget and the national development plan will consolidate. For those reasons, I commend the budget to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was gratified to hear the Taoiseach mention the balance which is required and to state that the Government is prepared to work with the social partners to achieve that balance. It will also listen to the people and to reasoned argument put forward on their behalf.</P>
      <P>I published a Green Paper on sustainable energy last September which was well received. It makes a significant contribution to the debate on how we are to meet our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. The Green Paper proposes a framework for energy efficiency in Ireland and sets out our policy both for limiting energy related CO2 emissions and the use of renewable energy sources over the period of Ireland's compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emphasis is given to highlighting measures which will promote energy efficiency among targeted consumers. There is also a major emphasis on the role which can be played by electricity generated from renewable sources. In the Green Paper I have set an ambitious target of 500 megawatts of additional installed capacity from renewables. In recognition of the fact there are constraints, I have established a renewable energy strategy group, under strong independent chair<Col N="625" /> manship, which will examine all aspects relating to the deployment of renewable energy sources. The group has been mandated to examine issues related to wind energy in the first instance and has been asked to report in approximately six months.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that a key priority of the national development plan is to identify those areas of expenditure which will assist us to meet our Kyoto obligations. A provision of £146 million has been earmarked in the development plan for energy measures. The first tranche of £6.2 million has been provided in the Department's Estimate for 2000, the bulk of which is aimed at enlarging the resources and role of the Irish Energy Centre. The intention is to establish the Irish Energy Centre, currently a unit within Enterprise Ireland, as a statutory body under the direction of a board as soon as possible. I am pleased the Green Paper, allied with a positive commitment by the Government in terms of funding, will not only complement this national strategy but will enable it to be prepared in a more constructive way.</P>
    <P>My Department is preparing draft legislation to transform Bord Gáis into an public limited company to give it greater flexibility in its affairs and to allow it to develop into a multi-asset, multi-customer organisation which would make use of its existing assets and expertise to diversify into related markets either at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of reports in the media in recent weeks concerning the supply of gas for electricity production. I want to set the record straight by outlining my plans. Having considered the response to a public consultation on the issue, I have decided that capacity should be allocated through a selection mechanism based on an evaluation of planned commissioning dates for power plants. In order to ensure independence in the allocation process, I have asked the Commission for Electricity Regulation to conduct the allocation scheme.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has advised that any scheme to select parties to whom the limited capacity should be made available should be put on a statutory footing. This morning the Cabinet agreed to the general scheme of a Bill to provide for such a selection mechanism. I hope to introduce this Bill to this House as soon as possible. In the meantime my Department will issue a policy paper and response to the public consultation.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the issue of new gas supply infrastructure which will be needed within the next four to five years. There are a number of possibilities. The gas find off the west coast by Enterprise Oil and its partners, Statoil and Marathon, looks promising but has yet to be declared commercial by the consortium. I have decided for the time being to wait and see whether the Corrib field is to be developed commercially before considering a proposal by Bord Gáis to build a second Scotland Ireland interconnector.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year my Department published a wide-ranging review of the road haulage industry, <Col N="626" /> which highlighted an urgent need to develop advisory support and market information services for the sector. As part of the Government's commitment to a strong and viable road haulage sector, the budget includes provision of a special grant of £100,000 to assist with the setting up of these services. The grant will permit the introduction, as a matter of urgency, of an implementation plan covering areas such as the promotion of information technology use, the facilitation of inter-firm co-operation to promote efficiency, the provision of financial and costing information and the development of market information systems. It is hoped these measures will encourage a more forward looking approach among hauliers to increase efficiency and profitability.</P>
    <P>The first complete seabed survey of the Irish offshore territory was approved by the Government in April 1999. The Geological Survey of Ireland, an agency of my Department, has responsibility for managing all aspects of this seabed survey, the object of which is to produce a series of topographic and geological maps of the seabed. It will provide an accurate basis for seabed maps of value to policy makers, fishermen, engineers, biologists, oceanographers and geologists. The maps will assist in studying seabed resources, such as gravel, minerals etc., natural hazards, preferred environments for living resources and the present and future environment of our seabed. Products will be available in paper and digital format as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This first detailed knowledge of the Irish marine territory of 900,000 square kilometres, which is ten times the national land area, is anticipated to yield great benefits in relation to policy for the sustainable development of all our marine resources and the conservation of our marine environment. The total approved cost of this survey is £20.7 million, which will be spent over seven years, starting in 2000.</P>

      <P>There is general agreement on both sides of the House and outside it that last week's budget is deeply unfair and socially divisive. That message has come across loud and clear from the public and from a number of the social partners and it has been received loud and clear by the Independent Members of the House who prop up the Government and by many Fianna Fáil backbenchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the debate this unfair budget has generated on the airwaves and, for a limited period, in this House. It raises issues of the most profound political nature and it is time we had such a debate. Those issues are threefold. First, they concern how we make decisions about the distribution of our national wealth and how best we can use its distribution to improve the welfare of <Col N="627" /> all citizens. It also raises the issues of how we view the role of families and the importance we attach to the needs of children. Finally, it raises the question of the influence of powerful vested interests on politics and their input into Government decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and his colleagues, like Thatcher before them, have often tried to claim that ideology is dead. This budget has proved that is not the case. It has flushed out the Minister and shown him for what he is, an unashamed, ideologically committed free marketeer, a person who believes that the individual is here to serve the economy, that community is about serving the economy, not the other way round. Most people believe that developing the economy is not an end in itself, that people put in effort to get the economy right to reap benefits for the entire community. They believe that the economy should be subservient to community. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has turned that idea on its head. He has adopted the values of the free market and is happy to let that market dictate how we live our lives and the value we place on families and children.</P>
    <P>The Minister is of the attitude that we should leave it all to the free market. Unfortunately, because of his ideological views, the Minister does not believe that the State has a role in ordering and improving society for the good of all. That is the key. The Minister does not appreciate the principle of the common good and has thrown it out the window in this budget.</P>
    <P>The ideology to which the Minister subscribes is one in which those who are better off should get more. That is what this budget does, it lets the powerful win over the weak. It sees people as mere economic units and completely disregards their other needs and responsibilities. Most significantly, it is an ideology which seeks to give huge pay-backs to people involved in property speculation who are already raking it in at the expense of ordinary people who are trying to provide homes for themselves.</P>
    <P>The most interesting aspect of the public reaction to the budget is that people writing to the newspapers and telephoning TDs of all parties and radio programmes, who stand to benefit by as much as £50 per week, are saying that this is wrong, that they do not need the money and would prefer to see it being used to tackle our serious social problems, to eliminate child homelessness, to give a hand up to those living on low incomes. They want to see everyone have a stake in the economy and society and want the fruits of the economic boom to be shared equally. People are not simply individuals interested in their own concerns. Irish people are interested in Irish society. They know the depths of poverty-related social problems and they want the Government to solve those problems.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, this Government has failed miserably to tackle those problems and to use the rising tide of economic growth to lift all boats. <Col N="628" /> People were promised that when the tide rose, everyone would be lifted. There was an opportunity to do that. Last year, in fairness to the Minister, he took the first steps to enable the tax system to be used to help everyone. He was given credit for introducing a system of tax credits so that this year the mechanism would be in place to assist everyone equally, to give £500 to every individual. Unfortunately he has ignored the progressive moves made last year and has reverted to type, deciding to reward those who are doing well while penalising those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The figures illustrate that. A couple trying to survive on £14,000 &ndash; I would like the Minister to explain how it is possible for a couple with two children to survive on £14,000 &ndash; benefit to the tune of 2.9% of their income, while a couple with similar responsibilities but with a joint income of £50,000 see their financial situation improve by more than 7%. In financial terms those on low income get a mere £400 extra per year while those on £50,000 get an additional income of £2,500. There is no social justice in those economics.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that some of the social partners have stated that they are not prepared to accept what the Government is doling out and have made it clear that the Government is flying in the face of the principles which underline partnership. It has dispensed with those principles, saying that it is no longer interested in working toward a partnership where everyone gets a share of the cake. I welcome the leadership Des Geraghty has shown on the issue. He is no longer prepared to go along with the cosy consensus that has passed for social partnership in this State. He is standing up for those he represents, people earning £12,000 who will get a meagre increase from this budget, while those lucky enough to earn £70,000 are handsomely rewarded by the Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the response from decent people to the Minister's proposals to individualise the taxation system. It is interesting that the arguments used in favour of individualising the taxation system have not been applied to the social welfare system. There has been public demand for the individualisation of social welfare payments to lift those at the bottom of the heap who are trying to survive on £70 per week. There are good reasons for the individualisation of the social welfare system, but the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, chose to ignore those people and instead proposes to individualise the taxation system.</P>
    <P>This move has shown up the Minister and his economist friends, such as Dr. Seán Barrett, for what they are. They are out of touch with the real world and do not realise what being part of a family means. They do not realise the responsibilities which go with rearing children. We have heard many examples of a parent in the home caring for someone with a disability or a dying relative. Those are the extreme cases. I am concerned about those who realise the needs of their family members. I heard Dr. Seán Barrett refer to this <Col N="629" /> debate in a radio interview in which he said that women want to be paid for sitting at home knitting. How dare people disregard the needs of children in this manner? How dare they tell people who are doing work in the home that they are not doing valuable work?</P>
    <P>This budget will come back to haunt the Government. In view of the reaction of the Fianna Fáil Party backbenchers, the budget is dead in the water and the Minister's position is untenable. I move the adjournment of this budget debate and I hope it will resume tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my Front Bench colleagues for the opportunity to introduce this Bill. Its purpose is to provide for a scheme to establish an authority known as the Irish Security Authority, which will regulate the Irish private security industry.</P>
      <P>I thank the many people who in the past year have helped to produce the Bill. There were valuable contributions from the security industry sector, especially by Mr. Paul Flanagan of the Security Federation of Ireland, Mr. John Byrne of the Security Institute in Ireland, Mr. Graham Picket of the Irish Security Industry Association and Mr. Bill Browne of NEWS. I thank those who crossed traditional party lines to help develop the Bill. I thank Mr. James Gilhooley, SC, and one person who I cannot name but without whose unqualified support, enthusiasm and risk taking this Bill would not have been possible.</P>
      <P>I would like to believe that no person involved with this Bill would suffer from that involvement, for it attempts to tackle some of the serious evils in society. Most Members will recall I introduced the Door Supervisors Bill on 23 and 24 March 1998. I recall the kind words expressed by the late Pat Upton on that occasion. Although the Bill was welcomed it was considered that its provisions did not go far enough and that broader legislation was required. In the intervening 18 months no alternative legislation has been introduced. When the Bill was debated in the House I said if the Minister did not undertake to introduce a Bill at the end of this year I would introduce a more comprehensive Bill to cover all the aspects of the security industry outlined by him at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to and need for this legislation is well known to us all. Only recently in Ballym<Col N="630" /> ount, members of the INLA and other Dublin criminals chopped each other up in a manner similar to that depicted in the movie &ldquo;Reservoir Dogs&rdquo;. What was the INLA doing in Dublin? I am reliably informed that many members of the organisation work as bouncers in the security industry. I advised the Minister of this two years ago, yet nothing has been done to introduce legislation to help protect visitors to clubs. It is my suspicion that the money circulating in the security sector allows criminals to become chameleons, to hide their spots to buy affluence and, more sinister, influence.</P>
    <P>What about the good people in the industry? Since early 1996 the legitimate tax paying security industry players have co-operated closely in a partnership mode to improve all aspects of their industry. This resulted in the establishment of the Security Federation of Ireland, bringing together an industry-wide focus. In 1978 the industry established the first intruder alarm standard, IS 199. In the middle 1980s the first monitoring centre standard was introduced, IS 228. Both these standards now have third party certification in operation with the National Standards Authority of Ireland and they cover the electronics security industry sector. However, only dedicated and quality companies have adopted the inspectorate scheme to date.</P>
    <P>On a European level, the Security Federation of Ireland is the Irish representative of the Confederation of European Security Services, the CoESS. There is mutual recognition of the CoESS in Euro-Fiet social partners for the European security industry. The Security Federation of Ireland is participating in the fifth directive general with regard to training and related areas. The European security industry, under the auspices of the CoESS and Euro-Fiet and with the support of the EU, launched a new initiative for the awarding of contracts for demand for the security sector. The electronic sector of the security industry is also heavily involved in the work of Cenelec, which covers the harmonisation process on alarm systems, close circuit television systems, access control and so on. Several new Irish standards have now been published.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the legitimate taxpaying security industry has also been involved in the establishment of a joint labour committee, the purpose of which is to issue an employment regulation order, which will set out legally binding terms and conditions of employment for private industry security staff. The industry is also actively involved in the development of a national traineeship through FÁS for both the guarding and electronic sectors. In September 1999 the IS 999 Guarding Security Services was launched by the NSAI. This provides a specification that will enhance quality of service and set out criteria for selection, screening, training, a code of conduct, operations requirements and ongoing assessments.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to fully implement the recommendations of its appointed consultative group undermines every effort made <Col N="631" /> by other parties in the industry. These improvements cannot stand alone and it was only on the understanding that the Government would fulfil its agreed agenda that employers felt empowered to deal with these other areas. The security industry is now left in a situation where it has imposed demands on itself without the necessary protection of licensing. This will result in a more fragmented industry with lower standards than exist at present. The current situation is that any person or group can form a company for the purpose of providing a security service, present themselves as a professional security provider and gain access to sensitive security information.</P>
    <P>Legitimate companies have enormous difficulties in adequately vetting their staff and because of the Data Protection Act, many businesses are left vulnerable to criminal intrusion. This is proven by the many court instances where security officers are charged with crimes against their employers' client companies. The security federation has written to all Members of the House seeking support for this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 lists the definitions. I have gone as far as possible to cover the broad sweep of the Irish private security sector, including door supervisors, many of whom we would not like to have as friends. The Minister should have acted to address the problems in this area when we last debated the matter 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 provide for the establishment of a body to be known as the Irish Security Authority. This is in keeping with the consultative group established by the previous Minister for Justice, my colleague, Deputy Owen, and whose final report was accepted by the Minister. Two years ago the report identified 13 functions for a new security authority. These are the issuing of licences, advising the Minister, who needs much advice on this issue, specifying standards, laying down training requirements, carrying out research, maintaining records for research, holding appeals, implementing relevant EU directives and regulations, monitoring international developments, conducting on-sight inspections and dealing with complaints. The Bill addresses these functions, especially in sections 5, 13, 21 and 24. The model it presents, with its open and cross-agency focus, is the best way forward.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out the establishment of a register and the appointment of a chief inspector. This industry has a very broad scope. In my research I have seen up to 40 sub-sectors identified in the UK position paper. It is prudent that categories of licences are provided for and this I have done. I acknowledge that the industry needs this as a protection and best practice way forward.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 introduce criteria for registration as a licensed provider of private security services and develop procedures and conditions. I have introduced training and qualification requirements which will be set by regulation, and not otherwise set in stone. This is very important and I think we have learned from the <Col N="632" /> discussions we had on the last occasion. This is a growing industry and must be regulated in a flexible manner. By setting requirements by regulation we will allow the industry to develop. If we decide to adopt a prescribed set of standards, who is to say they may not be redundant in five years time? If it took the industry 30 years to get to this point how long would it take to amend outdated legislation? God help us if we are depending on the people who are responsible for introducing legislation.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister's officials want to introduce their solutions. Any solution that does not involve partnership with the honest tax-paying member of the sector will not work and will cause a backlash &ndash; the Minister knows about them because he and the Government have been ducking and diving from one all week. I suspect the Department does not have people with the necessary experience to manage the Minister's wishes for this sector because it is two years since the consultative group reported.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is very important as it states who may not provide these regulated services. For years I have listened to how many sharp operators, when finally cornered by the various hard working regulatory authorities, were able to shut up shop and open up the next day in another corporate guise &ndash; the famous phoenix syndrome. I am sure the Minister knows a little about that. Section 9 introduces the concept of by-passing the corporate veil and getting to those who control companies. This is very effective law and one which the public and the industry require.</P>
    <P>Sections 10, 11 and 12 deal with the expiry, surrendering and non-transferability of certificate registrations. I accept that this is not light legislation in its scope and effect. Therefore, in sections 13 and 14, in the interest of fairness I have introduced an appeal board and procedures, all of which are outlined here and in the Second Schedule. If a person is refused registration he shall be able to appeal, and the person may also appeal conditions and restrictions imposed on his licence by the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the various regulations regarding records. This is a very important concept. As society grows and becomes more advanced we are going to need better private security services. In fact, we will need services not yet designed. It would be fatal to replace this Bill with a scheme that sets regulation in stone. This is a dynamic industry and one that is growing fast, for it has to catch up. Except for the United Kingdom, we are the only EU country that does not regulate its private security industry. Even countries that are on the waiting list to join the EU have regulated this sector. It would be ridiculous to develop legislation which would not be able to respond to future changes in this sector and I propose that the empowering Ministers with regulations is the sensible way forward. Anything less would be seen as a punishment of the industry for seeking to better itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> Section 16 deals with the cancellation of registrations where issues of false information, unfurnished information, abuse or failure to comply with obligations are involved. To be fair I have provided that no action shall take place until such persons have had a reasonable opportunity to reply. Section 17 details relevant offences. These apply where persons wilfully make false statements, furnish false documents, fail to return licences and have unauthorised possession of licences. I also include persons who aid, abet, counsel or procure licences in an improper manner and persons who do not keep proper records or fail to comply with the regulations made under this Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 prescribe a certificate of registration as evidence of registration and a prohibition against personation of gardaí. Section 20 introduces a complaints procedure which is always a very important factor. If the State licenses a sector, especially one which has a tremendous interaction with the public it is important that the public has confidence in the legislation. There must, therefore, be a proper complaints procedure. Section 21 details powers of entry, inspection and arrest by gardaí and of entry into premises by inspectors.</P>
    <P>Sections 23, 24, 25 and 26 detail annual reporting to the Minister, restrictions and disqualifications from membership of the authority or appeal board and the imposition of financial charges for registration. A low annual fee of between £10 and £15 per individual would more than cover the cost of such a scheme and the knock-on effect on the black economy would generate millions in tax revenue which are otherwise lost to the Exchequer every year. The First Schedule details the structure of the proposed authority and the Second Schedule deals with the structure of the proposed appeal board.</P>
    <P>The Private Security Services Bill, 1999, is relevant, effective and much needed law. I have done my best to help develop and support a struggling industry sector. I have designed this scheme with a mind to protect the public. All who have supported me on this issue have said that the time is now. There is no quick buck to be made here. This legislation attempts to level the playing pitch by protecting and supporting those who pay their taxes and protecting those who spend their hard earned wages on such services. We must stop rewarding those who abuse our economic structures.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of this Bill before the summer recess the Minister and his officials have had ample opportunity to prepare the heads of a Bill. Furthermore, I am told that this Bill will not be accepted. I bring to the attention of the House a newspaper report of a court case held a couple of weeks ago:</P>
    <P>A bouncer at Goodtime Charlie's in Howth has been found guilty of an assault which left a youth's jaw hanging from his face.</P>
    <P>I brought this Bill to the House two years ago <Col N="634" /> having spent the previous two years researching this question. I informed the Government and asked it to regulate this industry. The Minister appointed a consultative group to make proposals which would ensure that such a report would never again appear in our newspapers. Two years later, by doing nothing, we are allowing our young people who go out at night to be harassed by people who take the law into their own hands. The case I mention is about the sixth to appear in the newspapers in as many weeks and there is more to come.</P>
    <P>The last time I spoke on this subject in the House I received four telephone calls from the mothers of four young lads who had been harassed by bouncers in clubs in various parts of the country. The bouncers were themselves taking cases against the young men. Were it not for the work of a very eminent lawyer, the reputations of these young lads could have been destroyed by these thugs. The four young men, who I sent to see the eminent lawyer, won their cases. Although I did not need that proof, this proved there was a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Speaking on Second Stage of the Door Supervisors Bill in March 1998 the Minister said &ldquo;.I will immediately bring proposals to Government recommending what I consider to be the most realistic, effective and appropriate course of action to cater for a growing industry.&rdquo;. Twenty one months later there are no such proposals. At the time that Bill was brought before the House, many members of the security federation were not happy to be associated with it. However, they were anxious to introduce regulation in the industry and if that meant regulating bouncers and door supervisors, so be it.</P>
    <P>I extend my thanks to the members of the federation for the efforts they made and the discussions they held to put together the agreed formula which is included in the Bill. This Bill has not been taken off a shelf or been drafted by one or two people. It is agreed by an industry which has been ignored by the Minister and his Department. There were to be meetings with members of the industry every three months but one can count the number of times the meetings were held on the fingers of one hand. Indeed, there were plenty of opportunities to have such meetings in the period since this Bill was published.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not about scoring points but about providing services for an industry which is in severe competition with illegal and unregistered operators who flout the law. The stories about the problems in this industry today are no different from those we heard about two and a half years ago. The Minister will tonight inform the House about the great things he has in store for private security services. If I and the colleagues who helped me with this legislation achieve nothing else but the Minister's announcement that the heads of a Bill are agreed, it will be a step forward. The Minister could put the heads in this Bill if he wished. The industry must be regulated. The Minister must do something now to prevent <Col N="635" /> young people being harassed in the manner I described earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Farrelly on introducing this Bill and for the hard work he put into drafting it. It is important legislation and I am puzzled the Government has not brought forward its own legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>The security industry is important. We are not sure how many people work in it because many of its operators work in the black economy. However, estimates put the figure at 20,000. Security does not simply involve standing at a door looking tough. There is more to it and people who work legitimately in the security industry are aware that it can offer good career prospects. Due to the lack of regulation and standards in the industry &ndash; anybody can put themselves forward as security personnel, doormen, bouncers and so forth &ndash; it cannot be considered a career option by young people even though there are already 20,000 people working in the sector.</P>
      <P>I am aware from my contacts with people in the security sector that they take pride in their jobs and are seeking and would welcome regulation and standards in the industry. This Bill is the first step in that direction. Many more must be taken. It is a growing and complicated industry and research on its development must be carried out. Newspapers carry reports, particularly coming up to Christmas, on the high tech equipment used by people in the security industry. This equipment is computerised and links shops with other shops and retail outlets. People in the security industry battle daily against organised criminals who target these shops. They must be capable, well equipped and well trained.</P>
      <P>At present, there is little or no training for people in the security industry. Some are trained but there are low standards in many areas and this issue must be addressed. The Minister should accept this Bill or bring forward his own legislation as soon as possible. With legislation, the security industry can be put on a footing whereby people who work in it can be proud of it and young people can aspire to working in it. The industry needs to be defined. A good report on the private security industry was published by the consultative group established by my colleague, Deputy Owen, when she was Minister for Justice. The report contains many valuable suggestions and ideas. I am puzzled as to why the current Minister has done nothing in this area during his term of office. It is obvious that something must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 20,000 licences would probably be issued in the first year if the authority described by Deputy Farrelly was established. Regulation would not cost the Exchequer anything as it would be self financing. Establishing the authority would also assist in regulating the black economy. Many people in this sector operate in the black economy and they are in direct compe<Col N="636" /> tition with people who work in the legitimate security industry. This does the industry much harm. There is much disquiet and concern about low standards in the industry and Deputy Farrelly offered a number of examples of people being assaulted and injured, as a result of lack of training, supervision and regulation in the industry. This must stop and the Minister has the power to do it.</P>
    <P>The problem goes beyond instances of assault and injury. They are extreme examples even though they continue to occur. A security person who is properly trained will know how to deal with the public. A properly trained and supervised doorman will know how to deal with the unruly punter. He will know there are many ways of avoiding confrontation.</P>
    <P>At present, the public has no means of redress if a problem occurs except to sue through the courts. Establishing an authority would enable members of the public to make complaints about people who offend them. This is important. Anybody can set themselves up as a security person at present. A person might have a criminal record but no account is taken of it. He might have dealt in drugs yet still be able to establish himself as security personnel. He might even have convictions for assault. This is detrimental to the legitimate industry. It is also unfair competition.</P>
    <P>This situation is not good enough. We must develop the industry. There is an international dimension to this industry, as the Minister will be aware. Other countries in Europe offer training for security personnel. Ireland is one of the few countries in the EU that does not regulate the security industry.</P>
    <P>How is existing law, for example, the Organisation of Working Time Act, to be applied to an industry which is unregulated and for which a register does not exist? How is it known who is working in the industry, where they are working and whether they have training? It is a special industry which is growing and developing, and it needs the support of the Legislature. The Minister should bring forward legislation or adopt this well prepared and well thought out legislation. It would save him and his officials much time and effort if he did so. We would accommodate necessary amendments to the legislation on Committee Stage. Why does the Minister not bring forward his own legislation? Why will he not accept the legislation we are debating? We should work together to ensure the development of the industry and to cater for those working legitimately within it.</P>
    <P>What would happen if an employee had no training and there was a bomb scare? What would he or she do if they had not been told what to do? Are security people trained in first aid? If someone is injured, do they know what to do? These are basic skills any person working in this area should have.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the notion of the carrying of a badge. Many people, when they wear a hat with a badge on it, seem to grow in stature <Col N="637" /> and seem to think they can take the law into their own hands. If they are properly trained and regulated, they will know that when they put on a cap with a badge or wear a badge on a jumper, there is a corresponding responsibility. The people who work in the legitimate industry know that. The wearing of a badge carries responsibility and people must be trained in that responsibility. Without a regulatory authority and certification, this will not happen.</P>
    <P>We must do something about this. It is crying out for attention and action. Have people who work in the industry any training in the law and do they know what they can do within the civil and criminal law? I assume those who work in the legitimate industry probably know, but those who work in the black economy probably do not. I have been present when people have been assaulted. It is not a pretty sight to see people using their fists and boots on younger people who might have a few drinks taken. The people who did this did not know any other way. They were not trained. They knew that, apart from someone taking them to court, which was an extreme step, there was no other sanction. There is a sanction in the Bill in that they will be struck off the register if they step out of line. Security people also have a redress in the Bill in that it provides for an appeals mechanism, which is important. The mechanism works in different ways. The Bill contains safeguards for everyone, both for the punter and the person working in the security industry.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the growth in the electronics industry. There is a question of the use of electronic devices. Are people trained to use them properly? That is important. I mentioned fire safety. If a fire breaks out, the security person on the spot must take control in many areas. How many are trained in this? A legitimate security man probably will be, but those working in the black economy and who are unregulated probably will have no fire safety training. How important is reporting and the keeping of records? Does this happen in the industry at present? Reports and records of incidents should be kept. How do security staff link up with the Garda? If the industry were registered and regulated, these links would be built in.</P>
    <P>The general duties of a security officer would be spelt out and laid down and people would be trained in them and would have to follow them. They would also have the support of the law in carrying out their duties. At present, this is not the case. We are waiting for a major crisis or incident to occur where a person is injured or killed because many people in the security industry have no training and only know one way of reacting.</P>
    <P>There are also other aspects of the security industry. The bodyguards sector is growing at a huge rate. Many people do not know about it, and perhaps the Minister could tell us what he knows about it. How many bodyguards operate in Ireland? What is the situation regarding private investigators? Perhaps the Minister could tell us <Col N="638" /> about that. There is also the situation regarding suppliers and installers of alarms and closed circuit television. These are expensive and important pieces of equipment. What regulation exists in this area? These are not mentioned in the Bill but they are in the same general area. People are also spending a great deal of money on in-house security. It is important that a person's house is secure. These issues I raise show how broad and big the industry is, how much money is involved and how many people work in it. We need to examine not just the area under discussion but also the broader industry. I wish to share time with Deputy Boylan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Farrelly on bringing forward the legislation. People were never more security conscious than now with the booming economy. I am aware of security being offered to businesses and of businesses having refused and having been subsequently burgled. I am aware of businesses which hired security and which had their premises burgled. There is something seriously wrong. It is not good enough nor is it credible. I am aware of a person who recently travelled abroad, left their car at Dublin Airport and returned three days later to find their BMW burgled. The lock was drilled, the alarm system was activated, but no one took any notice, and it kept going until the battery went flat. The person reported it, but the security people said there was nothing they could do about it. Is that security? Is that the type of system we have in this country? It is answerable to no one.</P>
      <P>When I conducted some inquiries for this debate about how the system operated, I found that hotels, discos and large pubs no longer directly employ security people. Companies now provide this service. It was at that stage I came across notepaper headed &ldquo;24 Hour Security Limited&rdquo;. I should imagine it is strictly limited. I asked who was involved in the company. The people who used the service said they had no idea. I have no doubt that people who were involved in other activities have now moved into the security business. That is not good enough nor is it acceptable.</P>
      <P>I must feel that my children, when they are out for their entertainment, are safe, and that if there is a problem in the place of entertainment, there are people present who can deal with it. I do not want gurriers, thugs or muscle men throwing their weight around. Young people can be boisterous and matters can get out of hand, but not seriously. However, matters will get seriously out of hand if a person who has no knowledge or experience of how to deal with it becomes involved. What training do these people have? It is probably training where they wore balaclavas and carried guns. Now that that is ended, they have moved to another industry to make a livelihood. We must be ahead of these people. The Minister owes it to the people and it is his responsibility to ensure that security in the country is in safe hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> I thank God we have the Garda which has marvellous and wonderful people who can do so much. However, they are dependent, when they arrive at the scene of an incident, on the people to whom they talk, and those people must have credibility. They must be people from whom the Garda can obtain a name and address, and the Garda must be certain that the information being given is factual and not one-sided to vindicate the use of brute force.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to refer to a more recent case where a decent woman shopping in a supermarket in the city was taken in for shoplifting. To try to gain bonus points the security man had placed goods in her bag claiming he had caught her shoplifting. However, he was found out and the woman was vindicated, but she was humiliated for six months while the court case dragged on. Those are the type of people we are talking about. That said, there are good people who are anxious to provide a good service and who need training and backup and legislation to protect them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I acknowledge Deputy Farrelly's long and keen interest in regulation of the private security industry. I should also state that both in Government and in Opposition I have had a particular interest in the area of regulatory reform. I wish to say, however, that the Government is committed to its own Bill in this area and does not intend to support the Bill the Deputy proposes. The House should be aware as well that work on producing my Bill is well advanced. I accept and admit that production of the Bill has been slower than I hoped. The reason for this is that among the 24 Bills which have been passed by the House and which were published by my Department since the Government came to office, there was a considerable amount of work attaching to legislation dealing with the Northern peace process and, latterly, immigration. Unfortunately legislation in this regard pushed back the legislation further than I wished. This does not mean I am not fully committed to legislation in this area, but there are only 24 hours in a day and there is only so much legislative time available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that what is in question under the Bill is the establishment of a State licensing and regulatory authority for the private security industry, that Exchequer funding in one way or another will be involved, that staffing issues will be involved and that until such time as the Bill is enacted and even beyond that time, ongoing consultations with relevant interests, including representatives of the industry, Departments and the Garda Síochána will be a necessary feature in the context of the policy that is finally decided upon. That policy will need to be carefully considered, shaped and implemented by way of a Bill as well as the regulations to be made under such a Bill. The measures are not, in my <Col N="640" /> view, of a kind that lend themselves to being accepted readily as a Private Members' Bill. I am conscious, nevertheless, that the Deputy's Bill is a sincere effort on his part. It is of considerable importance and will contribute to debate in this area and help in the preparation of the Government's own Bill.</P>

      <P>The informed background to legislation in this area is, of course, the report of the consultative group on the private security industry. That group reported in late I997 and it was the decision of the Government to approve in principle implementation of the recommendations contained in the report. I brought the report before Government in early 1998 and was given permission to proceed with a view to drafting heads of a Bill which will be completed in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously assured the House that the scheme of the Bill that I am proposing to submit to Government is in the process of being finalised for circulation to Departments. I can confirm that circulation of that scheme is imminent and the intention is to bring it to Government very shortly. I can also assure the House that my Department has already engaged in a good deal of consultation on the Bill and that process will continue. I have met with representatives of various interest groups and in the past couple of weeks I met with some of the groups represented on the consultative group. I have arranged for consultations with those interests to continue with my Department.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that I as Minister must ensure that statutory regulation of the private security industry is on a sound footing. That regulation requires careful deliberation not only of the organisational and administration aspects which have financial and staffing implications for the Exchequer but also of the legal and even constitutional aspects that may be involved. Provisions dealing with access to employment, in particular, raise significant legal issues affecting, possibly, fundamental rights of individuals and the right to earn a living. The scale of the industry, which has been referred to by Deputies Farrelly, Stanton and Boylan this evening, is a factor which also reminds one of the importance of getting matters right in the Bill. The Deputies have pointed out that the security industry is at work in various aspects of the daily life of the community. Security guards patrol our shopping centres and protect property; security companies carry out cash deliveries for financial institutions and the State and companies provide security alarms for businesses and private homes. These are but a few examples of the important role played by the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> The report of the consultative group drew attention to an estimate which put the scale of the industry as involving nearly 400 companies employing over 10,000 employees and with a turnover estimated at about £200 million annually. This estimate did not include the door supervisor sector, which the group estimated could be in the region of 10,000 additional people, most of whom are believed to be employed on a part-time basis and, apparently, some of whom conduct their affairs in what is called nowadays the informal economy.</P>

      <P>The need to provide for statutory regulation as such of the private security industry is by now, I assume, accepted by all sides of the House. Of course, prior to the establishment of the consultative group in 1997 and publication of its report there was no particular consensus as to whether legislation was necessary or on the way. The group's task was to analyse the issues, to examine the ways in which such a broad spectrum of activity currently carried out by the industry could be regulated in practice, and to consider the regulatory practice for the security industry in other jurisdictions. There was a view prior to the group's deliberations that, while there are problems in the industry such as the need to improve standards, inadequate training of staff and sometimes poor compliance with Revenue, social welfare and company law, a number of these problems could and should be addressed within the existing Government and private security industry structures. The consultative group was specifically asked to consider options for increased self-regulation, the possible registration of companies and to set out options also for the introduction of statutory regulation of the industry. The group was asked, in focusing on options for regulation, to include the costs and benefits to the consumer of further regulation and to consider the prospects for improving standards within the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's report contains detailed recommendations for regulation of the industry and concluded that further scope for voluntary regulation of the industry had been exhausted and that a statutory body should be established to introduce, control and manage a comprehensive licensing system for various sections of the industry. The group recommended that structures should be put in place for appeals, fitness to practice and complaints mechanisms. Those recommendations of the group form the basis of my heads of legislation to be submitted to Government shortly. I have also taken into account the codes of law that exist in places such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand. It is also of interest that a consultative paper on the subject was published in the United Kingdom in respect of the regulation of the industry in England and Wales and that legislation is proposed there taking into account the various responses to that paper. <Col N="642" /> When the Government has made its decision on the details of my proposals I shall be glad to announce those details in due course. I will now address certain provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The report of the consultative group sets out a comprehensive range of functions for a regulatory authority. It points out that any regulatory framework for the private security industry will not only have to deal with the question of access to the industry but with a series of issues aimed at having a significant impact on the industry in the medium and long-term. Among the many functions of a regulatory authority identified by the consultative group as requiring consideration for inclusion in a Bill are the following: issuing licences to companies, directors and individuals; the maintenance of a publicly accessible register of these licence holders; specifying minimum standards for certain sectors; laying down training requirements for licence holders; designating approved training courses and institutions; holding fitness to practice hearings and appeals; conducting on-site inspections; dealing with complaints and publishing an annual report on the industry.</P>
    <P>Those recommended functions of an authority are not clearly set out in the Deputy's Bill. They are issues that were considered essential by the consultative group with a view to professionalisation of the industry and for the improvement of standards. The Bill seriously lacks comprehensiveness.</P>
    <P>One of the principal recommendations in the report of the consultative group is that a standard vetting procedure should be introduced for all licence applications to the proposed authority, to be carried out by the Garda Síochána. This was linked to a recommendation in the group's report that individuals who have committed certain criminal offences should be prohibited from holding a licence. The House will appreciate that to give effect to these recommendations careful drafting of legislation would be required.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a vetting procedure, such as that recommended by the consultative group, is a crucial factor on which an adequate system of regulation will depend. In addition, access to information held by the Garda Síochána would be essential for any system of vetting to work effectively. It would seem important, therefore, that a sound legal basis is provided in the Bill for the vetting of applicants for licences at both the original application and renewal stages and that provision should also be made for the subsequent reporting by licence holders of any criminal convictions between the time a licence has issued and the date on which it is due for renewal. Section 6(3) of the Bill approaches this issue in a limited and odd way by providing merely that the licence applicant should, upon request made by the authority, &ldquo;furnish his or her written consent, in so far as the same may be required, to the provision by the Garda Síochana, any health board or any registered medical practitioner, of information in their possession regarding the character or health <Col N="643" /> of the applicant and, if the applicant fails or refuses within 30 days to furnish such consent, the authority may refuse the application in question&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is not a direct statutory basis provided in the Bill for the clearance checks recommended by the consultative group. Neither is there a statutory basis provided in the Bill, apart from the consent provision, for either the authority to obtain information on the criminal convictions of the licence applicants&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what amendments are about, such as will happen with the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;or in the case of renewal applications, of licence holders and, more importantly for the Garda Síochana or others to provide such information to the authority. The issue of clearance checks is vital to the proper operation of the Bill but it is also vital that they are of a kind that can be administered by the relevant authorities on a feasible basis. The introduction of any statutory system of vetting must have regard to the implications of the increased workload that this will involve for the Garda in circumstances where as many as 20,000 applications might potentially be the subject of some character check prior to the issue of a licence.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not require licence holders to notify the authority if they are, for example, convicted of a criminal offence between the time a licence is issued by the authority and the time it is due for renewal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As carrying out character checks and the need to report offences would form an essential basis for the efficient operation of any new licensing procedures, these are important omissions from any regulatory regime which will have to be more clearly addressed in legislation of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither is it easy to discern the motivation for the inclusion of medical practitioners or health boards in section 6(3). Should certification of the health status of an employee or prospective employee be required in respect of his or her employment or registration for such employment there are standard procedures for this which are already well recognised and widely used. In such circumstances, a doctor, with the consent of his or her patient, can make known to an employer, or other agency, the nature of any condition which would be of relevance to the undertaking or continuation of employment. In any event, I am also advised that even if, for example, an applicant for registration provided consent, no doctor or health board official would feel under any legal or ethical obligation to furnish such an opinion in an area in which that opinion would carry no more or nor less weight <Col N="644" /> than any other professional person with whom the applicant might come into contact such as a dentist, pharmacist or accountant.</P>
      <P>The report of the consultative group recommends that certain criminal offences should rule out entitlement to a licence. This Bill, however, apart from referring to a good character requirement in section 5(1) and in section 16(1)(e) to the cancellation of a licence on foot of a conviction for &ldquo;an offence involving dishonesty or violent behaviour towards any person&rdquo;, does not specify the criminal offences which may disqualify a person from obtaining, continuing to hold or renewing a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Another amendment could have sorted that out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor does it refer directly to the fact that a criminal conviction could result in such a disqualification. The need for transparency and legal certainty would seem to require that this issue be expressly addressed in the Bill. In this context one might also expect the Bill to provide power to the regulatory authority to check with, say, the Companies Office so as to verify the probity of a security company. No such provision exists in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The lack of comprehensiveness is also evident in relation to criteria for entitlement to licences and registration. The criteria for entitlement to a licence must, on any basis, be comprehensive so that licence applicants know exactly what requirements must be fulfilled to enable the authority to respond positively to a licence application. This kind of provision is absent from the Bill.</P>
      <P>The consultative group identified a wide range of security activities and categorised them into groups of primary and secondary concerns for licensing purposes. The report concentrated on primary activities such as security operatives, door supervisors or &ldquo;bouncers&rdquo;, in-house security personnel, security consultants, including advisers, sales persons and private investigators and, finally, installers of security equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the group envisaged that other sections of the industry could be included in the licensing requirement in due course by means of regulation. These include, for example, bodyguards and those involved in document destruction. There is provision in section 4(1) for registration of various categories of licensees but there is not any provision to enable additional categories to be added to the licensing requirement. On this basis the Bill, while catering for the licensing of certain activities, simply fails to provide for the licensing of others. The consultative group recommends the licensing of both private security companies and their directors. The group suggested that company licences should be issued only after rigorous checks of applications, including the provision of tax clearance certificates, and that such licences would be reviewed by the authority every two years or whenever there was a <Col N="645" /> change, for example, in any of the directors of a company. The Bill concentrates on the licensing of individuals but does not require companies to be licensed by the authority.</P>
    <P>Central to any system of regulation is a mechanism for dealing fairly with complaints against licence holders. The report of the consultative group envisages that a comprehensive and transparent complaints provision should be included in legislation based around a fitness to practice committee. This would, among other matters, deal with complaints about licence holders from the general public and other sources. Such committees are a feature of both primary and secondary legislation in other areas and, on either basis, it would seem useful to establish complaints procedures which would specify such matters as how complaints are to be made; who can make them; the nature of the investigatory procedures to be operated by the authority into such complaints; the grounds on which sanctions can be imposed by the authority where a complaint is upheld and the nature of the sanctions to be imposed if a complaint against a licence holder is upheld by the authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains, in section 20, a limited and inadequate complaints provision which merely requires the authority to give consideration to any complaint that is not of a frivolous or vexatious nature and provides that while the registration of the security person is in force the authority must keep proper records of all such complaints and of any reply to or action taken on foot of them. Moreover, there is no clear provision in the Bill to make particular regulations to give effect to proper complaints procedures.</P>
    <P>While the Bill provides that the authority shall be led by a chief inspector who shall be its chief executive, the report of the consultative group would appear to envisage that the authority's chief executive and inspectorate would be separate functions. The chief inspector and his or her inspectorate would concentrate on such issues as training, application of standards and the investigation of complaints. An efficient inspectorate could be of particular importance in the context of compliance with licensing requirements. This might allow the chief executive to manage the authority, to take in fees and control and generally promote the administrative functions of the authority.</P>
    <P>For the detailed reasons I have given, there is no possibility that this Bill can command the support of the Government. What I can reiterate for the House, however, is that my programme of legislation as established by the Government will continue to be progressed vigorously and it includes a private security industry Bill.</P>

      <P>That programme of legislation to date, since I took office as Minister in June 1997, comprises a total of 24 Bills which <Col N="646" /> have entered the Statute Book. My current legislative responsibilities extend to 12 Bills that are before this House or the Seanad, and I have many other Bills in various forms of preparation. Some, inevitably, are more advanced than others and I am glad the private security industry Bill is being progressed among the other priorities.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Farrelly's concern that the private security industry needs a clear system of statutory regulation. That regulation must be comprehensive and effective in the public interest but it must also foster a balance so that the industry can develop without undue hindrance. The regulatory authority must be funded in one way or another. It must be in a position to do its job effectively and efficiently. Above all, it will require a good and comprehensive code of law. I intend bringing those detailed measures before the House in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that it is not my intention in any way to denigrate the legislation brought before the House by Deputy Farrelly. I have acknowledged his genuine interest and concern in providing legislation in this important area. His Bill is important in this respect in the context of framing sound statutory provisions for the future regulation of that industry.</P>
      <P>Consultation is clearly of considerable importance, not just with the Opposition spokespersons in this area but with the representatives of the industry. I have made it clear that my door is open to the industry and I met its representatives recently. I have assured the industry and the unions involved in the industry, and I take the opportunity of doing so again now, that it is my intention that they should be kept fully informed of developments and that they should be consulted as the legislation is being framed. After all, the legislation is of greater importance to them than it is to anybody else because they have been calling for this legislation for a long time.</P>

      <P>My legislation will do much by way of regulation to allow detailed consultations with the industry on the nitty-gritty areas after the Bill has been enacted. In other words, the legislation will provide for regulations which can be made by the Minister subsequent to the legislation being passed into the Statute Book. In respect of those regulations, which will be of considerable importance, the industry will be fully consulted.</P>
      <P>It was my wish that this legislation would be progressed far more expeditiously. I have given the reasons that was not so and it is a matter of some regret to me. When the legislation is published and it is finally enacted, all concerned will fully agree that with a comprehensive Bill on the Statute Book, the wait will have been well worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the Bill and congratulate Deputy Farrelly on bringing it before the House. From listening to Deputy Farrelly, in the Seanad when we were both Members of that House and here in the Dáil, I know he has a long interest in this issue and has called for legislation to be put on the Statute Book so as to properly control this industry.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a response to the failure of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take action on the report of the consultative group on the private security industry which is now almost two years old. The consultative group report represented a watershed in the way the security industry is organised in this country. To date, the industry has operated in a largely unregulated and <i>ad hoc</i> fashion. There are no enforceable standards, checks on individuals who operate security companies or minimal training requirements. This important industry, in which approximately 20,000 people work in its various sectors, plays a key role in the protection of people and property, and it must be regulated. The vast majority of operators agree with this approach. They are as opposed to the cowboy element which has entered the industry as anyone else.</P>
      <P>The Government would have the support of all the legitimate interests in the industry if it were to introduce a statutory regulatory body as recommended in the report, but nearly two years since the publication of the report the Minister has failed to produce legislation. The reputation and standing of the industry continues to suffer from the Minister's lethargy. He should have the good grace to recognise this and accept the Bill brought forward by Deputy Farrelly this evening. As Deputy Farrelly said, the Minister would be free to amend the legislation in accordance with the various points he made in his contribution. I am sure Deputy Farrelly would take on board the Minister's proposed amendments. Those of us on this side of the House would have amendments also and if we put our heads together we would have a strong and effective Bill to regulate the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response to Deputy Farrelly that he will not accept the Bill. The Minister's legislation, which has not yet been produced &ndash; it has not even gone to the various <Col N="648" /> Departments &ndash; will go on the long list of awaited legislation in the Department. I accept that many items of legislation have been implemented and that other legislation is before both Houses of the Oireachtas and in the various committees, but those of us dealing with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform know there is a growing list of expected legislation in this area. I share Deputy Farrelly's concern about when the Government's legislation will be produced. From my experience in this House and working with the Department, I know it will take a long time before this legislation is on the Statute Book. I am disappointed the Minister has decided not to amend Deputy Farrelly's Bill and to proceed with a Bill which is unlikely to be passed during the course of next year.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the concerns raised by the consultative group. It provides a sound basis for legislative action and any concerns or amendments the Minister may have could be dealt with on Committee Stage. This route would ensure we would have sound and comprehensive security industry regulation on the Statute Book early next year. It is probably too late at this stage, but I hope the Minister will decide to deal with the issue in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The consultative group comprised representatives of the security industry, IBEC, SIPTU, the Garda Síochána, the Health and Safety Authority, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. The report was welcomed by the Minister who accepted that it was an excellent starting point and supported the recommendations for a statutory regulatory agency. Since then, however, the Minister's enthusiasm has waned and despite repeated requests on the Order of Business, we seem to be no nearer a Government Bill on this important issue. Nothing that was said tonight would reassure us that the Bill is any closer.</P>

      <P>Private Members' Business is the one time when Opposition Members have an opportunity to make a positive contribution to our legislative code. A number of Private Members' Bills have already been accepted by the Government this session, including the Bill on the Statute of Limitations which I published and which we will be discussing in the House on Thursday, the ticket touting and whistle blowers' protection legislation and the Bill on child sexual abuse introduced by Deputy Shatter. These are important items of legislation which will strengthen our legal code in a number of areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The acceptance of a Private Members' Bill is not a sign of weakness or failure on a Minister's part. Indeed, it is the exact opposite. It demonstrates that the Executive does not believe it has a monopoly on wisdom. I was struck by the sensible comments made by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, in the House last March when he spoke on the legislation on the prohibition of ticket touts which the Government accepted. He said:</P>
    <P>Government office does not confer a monopoly of wisdom on its holder. I hope that a characteristic of my time in office will be an openness to ideas, as well as a preparedness to work with people of good intentions from every background. That is what the people who sent us here expect from us.</P>
    <P>This sensible and reasonable approach is good for politics and good for this House. On the Statute of Limitations legislation, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has shown a similar measure of goodwill. Although the Minister and I strongly disagree on the Bill's detail, detail which is of critical importance, I appreciate his acceptance of the Bill. I had hoped that he would continue that practice in regard to the Bill before the House this evening but, unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. Such acceptance would reflect on the workings of the House and the ability of parliamentary democracy to tackle issues in a non-partisan, constructive fashion.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a security authority which would comprise a chairperson &ndash; a practising barrister or solicitor of at least ten years' standing &ndash; and ten ordinary members. Among the ordinary membership, five should be representatives of the Irish private security industry, two should be barristers or solicitors and one should be a senior member of the Garda. In terms of amending the Bill, I would suggest that a representative of the Youth Council of Ireland might be appointed to the authority &ndash; young people might have a good deal to say about how the industry should be run.</P>
    <P>The functions and duties of the authority, which are quite standard, are outlined in the First Schedule. I fully support the requirement for the authority to furnish a report on its activities to the Houses of the Oireachtas on an annual basis. In establishing any statutory agency, legislation should include a requirement for the chairperson to appear before an Oireachtas committee when requested to do so. Members may remember the lacuna in legislation which led to the development of a difficult situation between an Oireachtas committee and the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. We should learn from this experience and ensure that a requirement to appear before an Oireachtas committee is imposed on all statutory agencies in primary legislation. It is important in the context of democratic accountability. In recent years, in particular, the administration, regulation and enforcement of a number of laws passed by this House <Col N="650" /> has been entrusted to statutory agencies. I support this process and I also support the independence which lies at the heart of the operation of agencies such as the Food Safety Authority and the Irish Sports Council. It is important to recognise that these agencies are established by these Houses to enforce and administer duties conferred on them by the Oireachtas. It is important that accountability to the people's elected representatives is clearly stated in legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a more general point about the security industry which has concerned me for some time. A large number of security companies provide a guard dog service and, while many companies operate to the highest standards, I have grave concerns about the treatment of guard dogs by a number of operators. I have heard of cases where these dogs are almost starved in a mean-minded effort to cut down on overheads. The transport used to ferry these dogs can also be substandard. I doubt that the kennelling facilities provided by some security companies are much better. For anyone who has a love of dogs, the maltreatment of guard dogs by a number of operators is a grave cause for concern.</P>
    <P>I suggest this is one of the first areas any newly appointed security authority should address. Perhaps the appointment of a Member of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals during the authority's first term would send out the signal that the abuse of animals will no longer be accepted. I would also urge the authority to introduce new standards of accommodation, transport and hygiene for animals in the security industry. These regulations should be stringently enforced and those who treat dogs cruelly, in a pathetic attempt to line their own pockets, should be dealt with severely. The authority should introduce new training requirements for those in the security industry who are responsible for handling guard dogs. People should not be allowed to take charge of guard dogs unless they have first completed a training course on their management and a basic course in animal health. This would allow illness and disease to be addressed at an early stage and handlers would be able to identify a dog which required veterinary attention.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress upon the Minister the support which exists within the industry for a proper regulatory framework, as proposed in this Bill. Security operators and unions alike are emphatic about the need to clean up the industry and introduce a system to weed out cowboy operators. At present, anyone can establish and operate a security firm. Checks are not carried out into people's backgrounds and a number of dubious individuals, who provide a questionable form of security, have entered the trade in recent years. This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The recent economic boom has increased the demand for security services of all kinds. Like many other sectors of the economy, security services have expanded rapidly. The lack of regulation affects both the reputation of the industry <Col N="651" /> and the working conditions for staff in the industry. The unregulated nature of the industry gives rise to various abuses, especially of employees. Unions find it very difficult to recruit and regularise staff where firms are working in the black or grey economy. Workers lose out on important protections and benefits such as holiday and sick pay. Health and safety regulations are often flouted and, in some instances, the workers' well-being is put at risk. The benefits of new developments in the labour market, such as the working time or parental leave legislation, are often denied to workers in the black economy. This is an issue about which the trade union movement is deeply concerned. I share those concerns.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive regulation of the industry is urgently required if these issues are to be addressed. Unions and employers are agreed on this agenda. In September, the National Union of Security Employers underlined this point during the launch of the new national standard for the private security services. This voluntary standard, IS/9/99, provides security firms with standards on the vetting and training of employees. It also includes tough standards on the screening of individual applicants for positions in the security industry. These procedures and standards need to given a statutory basis and the Bill before the House provides the Government with an opportunity to progress this issue.</P>
    <P>One of the most obvious areas in which legislative change would have a real effect on the public relates to door staff at entertainment venues. The expansion of the entertainment industry in recent years has led to a huge increase in the number of premises which utilise the services of doormen, many of whom are provided on contract from security firms &ndash; I do not know whether there are many doorwomen in the industry. A casual review of court reports in recent years reveals the problems which exist in this area.</P>
    <P>There are numerous examples of door staff being convicted for violent assaults on customers, confirming anecdotal evidence which most Members have doubtless heard about the abuses perpetrated by some door staff. A report in <i>The Irish Times </i>of 4 March 1999 stated that a person received £13,000 in compensation for an assault carried out by a doorman in a night club in the centre of Dublin. According to the judge, this was the third violent incident involving night club door staff to have come before him in a matter of weeks. Mr. Justice Smith stated that it was a matter for the Legislature to introduce legislation to control this difficult situation in some way. Only last week, it was reported that a customer of a Dublin night club had to have a metal plate inserted in his face to reconnect his jaw bone following an assault by a bouncer.</P>
    <P>It is clear that some door staff believe they operate above the law. Some nightclub owners only seem to want intimidating men handy with their fists working in their clubs in a mistaken <Col N="652" /> belief that this is the way to deter disputes or fights which may break out. The behaviour of some doormen has dragged the whole image of the industry into the mire.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Boylan, I speak as a parent of young people who go out at night during the weekend. I have a 20 year old and 22 year old. From listening to them and their friends, there seems to be a fear of these people. One cannot stand up to them if they say one cannot come in, that one has to get out or that one's friend cannot come in. I heard of one instance where the locals were going to be let in but somebody who was not Irish was told he could not come in. One really cannot answer back. One is at the mercy of these people who are usually big, strong and powerful and one cannot question what they say. It is a concern to parents that young people are going out into an unregulated atmosphere such as this.</P>
    <P>In recent days I heard that body searches are sometimes carried out in nightclubs, not on the way in but inside. Someone can be pulled aside and told they are going to be searched without any reason being given. I accept the gardaí might find reason to search people but an unlicensed group of workers should not have the right to go up to somebody in a nightclub and tell them they are going to be searched. Young people do not have the means to answer back or to stand up for themselves. The equal status legislation is going through the House at the moment and I wonder to what extent it may be used as a protection. We need to regulate this industry urgently.</P>
    <P>Progressive elements in the industry want to radically reform this area and I would like to mention two recent initiatives which have been undertaken. One was started in Galway roughly 12 months ago. It was an attempt to halt the falling standards among door staff. A training course consisting of six modules, which covered all aspects of door security was launched. Topics such as fire prevention and evacuation, drug awareness and the legal issues of the business were covered.</P>
    <P>In addition, eight doormen in Dublin recently participated in a drugs education programme run by the Eastern Health Board. It was a ten week programme dealing with the legal and health aspects of drug use and participants received certificates from the health board after completing the course. These positive developments must be encouraged and facilitated by the Government. In this day and age, it is not acceptable that doormen and women have no training and no idea of the legal implications of their actions. This is a dangerous state of affairs. Action, including legislative action by the Oireachtas, must be taken to change it.</P>
    <P>As regards the manner in which this Bill relates to door supervisions, I suggest that section 18 be widened to include identification of door staff and, indeed, any security officers who come into contact with the public. Section 18 places an obligation on security personnel to produce evidence <Col N="653" /> of registration to a member of the Garda or an inspector. I suggest this section be extended to place a requirement on door staff and other security personnel to always wear an identification badge, to which Deputy Stanton also referred, visible to the public which would show their name and the name of their employer.</P>
    <P>Any proposed Irish security authority should embark on a public information campaign which would inform consumers and customers of their rights in situations where they come into contact with security personnel. Perhaps a joint campaign with the consumers' association or some other body may be appropriate. There are many incidents where innocent customers are detained by security staff, particularly in department stores. The legal basis on which these people are detained is unclear and it is essential that both staff and consumers are fully aware of their rights and their legal position in such a situation. It is a difficult job and it is in the interests of those who work in the industry as well as the public that it is properly regulated. They are powerful people and can ruin a person's reputation. If somebody is wrongly accused of stealing something from a shop, their reputation can be ruined for life. They can injure people, as we have seen from court cases. It is right that they should be regulated.</P>
    <P>The question of records and ensuring people with certain criminal records should not be included is something about which I feel strongly. I know there are people operating in the security industry who have criminal records and it is important that there is regulation in this regard.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Farrelly on the introduction of this Bill. There is widespread concern about the conduct of some private security operators but it would be grossly unfair for the whole industry to suffer due to the activities of a minority. Without adequate regulation, this will increasingly happen. If the rogue element in the security industry is not weeded out, the whole industry will pay the price and public confidence in the trade will be undermined.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there has been no indication from the Minister that if this Bill is not accepted we will see this type of regulation in the near future. Deputies are all well aware of the length of the Minister's list of work. There is no evidence that we will see such a Bill within the next six months. Again, I express my disappointment that we will not be able to deal with this issue on the basis of this Bill. I am concerned that this industry will continue to operate without regulation.</P>

      <P>Many speakers complimented Deputy Farrelly on introducing the Bill and on strongly pursuing the issue. The Minister accepts the principle and has clearly stated that it is his intention to introduce a Government Bill. He indicated that he has some reser<Col N="654" /> vations about the scope of Deputy Farrelly's Bill. The Minister's approach in this regard is sensible.</P>
      <P>People who do not have a close interest in the proceedings or in the industry will be astounded by the number of people who work in it. The report produced some time ago indicates that there may be as many as 10,000 employed as door supervisors, bouncers and so on. The other element which comes to mind when one starts to look closely at this industry is the huge divergence between security companies in terms of those which provide personnel, various electronic devices and other elements of what has, on the one hand, become a complex and modern industry but, on the other hand, it remains a very basic one. There should be a minimum requirement in terms of the qualifications of those involved in the industry. That is one aspect which will have to be carefully considered in the Government's legislation, which, I hope, will be introduced soon.</P>
      <P>I saw in the report an expectation that within two years of the setting up of the authority, which is the principal recommendation of the report, as many as 20,000 licences could be issued. When I saw that figure, I thought there must be a mistake in that there was one zero more than intended. The intention is that companies and individuals would be licensed. It would be a huge undertaking for the authority.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties to which the Minister adverted was the distinction between the chief executive officer and the chief inspector, which is not clear in Deputy Farrelly's Bill. The Minister said it needs to be firmly established in the legislation, and there is a strong case for that. There is also a huge amount of potential earning in the industry, with £200 million per annum currently being spent on it. There are enormous question marks over a relatively small percentage of those engaged in the industry in terms of their suitability.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations in the report is that the Garda should be involved in vetting the individuals who might be employed as doormen or who are involved in security firms. That is a sensible recommendation but it will cause difficulty with some existing companies and potential ones. It is something which will have to be addressed in the legislation. It will be a huge challenge for the authority when it is set up and for the chief executive officer and those who work in it. It will be extremely important that the legislation sets out their role clearly and in a straightforward manner. It will be difficult to draw up mechanisms to deal with fitness to practice.</P>

      <P>By and large I support the works announced by the National Millennium Committee, which is chaired by the Minister of State. I agree with the sentiments he expressed during the week on radio that, rather than copying Britain which has one major production, we in Ireland would implement projects that mean something to our people and which would be of lasting benefit and cultural significance. I agree with the Minister of State's allocation of funds to the National Millennium Park at the foot of Croagh Patrick beside the Famine ship, with funding for the planting of oak trees which will last longer than any of us and with other projects mentioned in the booklet produced by his committee. It gives an idea of the range of activities and ideas people suggested.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee allocated £700,000 to the production of &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo;. Since the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was first performed in Dublin's Fishamble Street in 1742 it has been performed all over the world. This is a commercial production and may take off on the international stage to become a money spinner<i> á la</i>&ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo;. In that context, can the Minister of State indicate whether any arrangements have been made so that, in the event of &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo; becoming an international extravaganza, the £700,000 awarded can be recovered? What is the position regarding copyright?</P>
      <P>I have not seen this production, but one critic in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday described the singing qualities of one of the stars, Mr. Jeffrey Osborne, when he groped for the right notes that &ldquo;it is as magical as a bucket of vomit&rdquo;. I am not privy to the thoughts of this art critic and I have not seen the production, so I cannot comment on it. However, a production of &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was issued on the Reprise label in 1992 which included Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight and Jeffrey Osborne. I wonder what similarities exist between that CD of 1992 and the current production?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State explain why it was deemed necessary to allocate £700,000 to a commercial venture, if there is any recoverability for the State if the venture takes off and what is the copyright position?</P>

In the event of reasonable profits we can negotiate for a charitable trust. I understand the copyright belongs to Frank McNamara, who is the brains behind the score. We felt the situation was similar to when one aids industry; it is better to make a clean award of funds and not get sucked into an ongoing legal involvement in copyright. We felt that was not a practical or sensible way to work.</P>
      <P>This is a unique time and one of the most significant benchmarks in history. The fact that a millennium comes about only once every 40 generations or so places a clear onus on this generation to mark it properly. The National Millennium Committee is marking the millennium in ways that are lasting, rewarding and dignified while, at the same time, reflecting the excitement and anticipation that the end of a thousand year cycle generates.</P>
      <P>The committee was set up to advise the Government on projects for inclusion in its Millennium Programme 1999-2000. Following a national advertisement campaign, hundreds of proposals, including the &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo; project, were submitted to the committee for consideration. The committee was particularly interested in projects which would be special to the millennium and that would be inclusive in terms of participation and enjoyment.</P>
      <P>In that context, the National Millennium Committee was impressed by the proposal to produce a contemporary version of the world renowned Handel's &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;. This new production, &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo;, expanded the original score to a symphonic and contemporary orchestration, broadening its appeal to include a younger audience. The project engaged internationally known artists to work with some of the best Irish artists, performers and technicians. It offered an exciting live performance using the most up to date staging, lighting and recording technology. Again, it utilised the very best of Irish talent in terms of the stage construction, design, recording and broadcasting elements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the core of the decision by the National Millennium Committee to support &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo; was the commitment from the promoters and RTE to turn the production into a television spectacular and to broadcast it as one of RTE's flagship millennium projects. Everybody in Ireland will have the opportunity to see this original and exciting celebration of the millennium when it is broadcast in the prime viewing slot of 7 p.m. on 30 December. The project was on a scale and at a cost which excluded it as a normal commercial proposition. It was to be a special event uniquely linked to Ireland and the millennium but which would probably never happen without the financial backing of the National Millennium Committee. &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo;, like the original version, has a strong Christian message running throughout and the main Christian churches gave a strong endorsement to the project. It also has a clear link to <Col N="657" /> Handel's original work which was also performed for the first time in Dublin.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo; also aims to be an internationally viable event. In supporting the project, the committee was very aware of its uniquely Irish dimension but also of the possibility of its international appeal. &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo;, whether it is to Deputies' taste or not, has provided Ireland with a very exciting millennium project to share with the rest of the world. By doing so, it will spread the central theme of the millennium, certainly in terms of this country, the Christian message around the globe in a very accessible and popular form. In doing so, it will reinforce Ireland's position as a world force in musical, artistic and creative endeavour.</P>
    <P>In considering &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo;, it is important that the House is aware of the other millennium themes which have been adopted by the committee and which are evident in the many projects it has recommended. For example, nearly £6 million has been recommended for social projects all over the country, including £2 million towards the Children's Hour fund raising initiative to help more than 100 children's causes, £750,000 for the establishment of a residential care centre for the elderly in Cork city, £250,000 for St. Vincent De Paul, £250,000 for the establishment by the Irish Wheelchair Association of a national mobility centre in County Kildare, £210,000 to fund the upgrading of the four Simon Community centres around the country, £150,000 has been allocated to the Hole in the Wall Gang at Barrettstown Castle, £100,000 has been made available towards a hospice in County Donegal and £60,000 to The Samaritans. These are just some of the key examples of the types of projects Deputy Kenny spoke about. Also, £1 million has been allocated to the provision of special facilities for parents and carers who must stay overnight at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire, while £1.6 million has been awarded to church projects, such as floodlighting of churches and towers, including Glendalough. In addition, £9 million has been allocated to a variety of environmental projects, such as bridges, lights, walkways, parks and forests. Yesterday we announced a project to grow an oak tree for every home in the country. Each tree will have a number so each family can identify their tree.</P>
    <P>The other sponsors of the &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo; include <i>The Irish Times</i>, which was quoted by the Deputy, RTE, Jury's Hotel and Delta Airlines. I was at a performance of &ldquo;Messiah XXI&rdquo; and it got two or three standing ovations that night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. I raise it following a number of parliamentary questions I tabled on the threat posed to this project by the termination of funds.</P>
      <P>For the past four years women from some of the most marginalised communities in Cork have gained employment under the new opportunities for women programme, a European funded project. During that time those involved developed and delivered education and training programmes for marginalised women throughout the city. Some of the programmes are with accreditation bodies for further development and should be made available in future to hundreds of women. Those involved designed and published a training manual as a tool for community women to work with each other in order to create personal, social and physical awareness and to bring about change. They secured funding to set up the first ever female owned resource centre at a city centre location.</P>
      <P>All this and much more was done by a team which taught the women concerned to work co-operatively and to develop skills to train as managers to ensure that they, in turn, could return to their communities to encourage their peers to participate in and take up leadership roles on issues of concern.</P>
      <P>All this work will end at the end of this month and ten women in Cork alone and approximately 60 nationally will become unemployed once again and virtually invisible, so to speak. Given that this is happening in the midst of financial abundance when the social economy is being developed and gaining strength from month to month, when women are being actively sought and encouraged to join the workforce or, under the budget, being forced to join it, and when more new initiatives are being launched to give a voice directly to the socially excluded, it is neither moral nor acceptable. I ask the Government to address this problem as a matter of urgency and to put in place mechanisms to provide the necessary Exchequer funds to allow this work continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project is poised to offer, through its resource centre, the experience and learning from the first four years of the project to a vastly wider group of women in Cork. What has been learned has been shared with other like minded women's groups at national and international level through their involvement in transnational partnerships. Through the development of courses on community education and development, a two year national certificate, and a four year bachelor degree in community education and development in conjunction with a Cork CIT, community women <Col N="659" /> in Cork will be able to acquire accredited qualifications specially geared to their particular needs and interests. This course will enable women to be employed and adequately paid to undertake work in their communities that they are already carrying out on a voluntary basis. None of this may, however, come to pass if the NOW funding, which is due to end in December, is not replaced by another appropriate and adequate funding mechanism for locally based community education and training.</P>
    <P>Is this a new dawn or a false promise for these women? If such funding is terminated, it will mean that four years of hard work and great learning will have been completely wasted. Twenty women &ndash; I am only talking about the position in Cork &ndash; at different stages of developing skills and knowledge will be lost to their communities and probably replaced by professionals who have had the opportunity of college education. This is not development in practice. The NOW projects could well become false promises for many disadvantaged women in Cork and elsewhere throughout Europe. I ask the Minister to ensure funding is made available to allow these excellent initiatives to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for raising this important matter. The new opportunities for women &ndash; NOW &ndash; programme is a strand of the EMPLOYMENT Community initiative, which is funded by the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund. The total investment in 71 NOW projects since 1995 will amount to 20.3 million ecu, approximately £15 million, in European Social Funds and 2.1 million ecu, approximately £1.6 million, in European Regional Development Funds. A total of 32 NOW projects are operating in the current phase, which commenced with a project development phase of three months in 1997. Projects were subsequently approved for a two year period to implement their action plans. Under the terms of the EU initiative, funds will cease to be committed at the end of 1999 and final payment will take place during 2000. All projects would have been aware at the outset of the finite nature of activities and associated funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community women's education initiative was approved 426,667 ecu, approximately £336,000, in European Social Funding under the NOW strand of the EMPLOYMENT initiative in January 1998 towards the cost of a project to be completed by the end of this year. The project aimed to develop relevant education and training models for women who have been marginalised economically and socially and it has been a success in that regard. In June 1998 the project was approved a further 189,873 ecu, approximately £149,000, in <Col N="660" /> European Regional Development Funding, also from the EMPLOYMENT initiative, towards the building and fitting out of an associated resource centre for women. The project was recently approved an extension by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to continue activity up to March 2000.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the EMPLOYMENT initiative is to target groups that face specific difficulties in the employment market and, accordingly, to explore innovative and new ways of combating exclusion in the labour market with a view to identifying and extracting lessons from specific projects and incorporating them into national policies.</P>
    <P>A mainstreaming forum was established by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 1997 to identify and extract the important lessons from the EMPLOYMENT pilot projects and to transfer these lessons to the mainstream of policy and practice. The forum consists of representatives from eight Departments and four agencies as well as the five administrative structures of the EMPLOYMENT initiative. Through participation in the mainstreaming forum, relevent organisations and policy makers have the facility to influence future policy actions arising from the outcomes of the initiative. The work of the mainstreaming forum is ongoing and will continue into 2000.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has issued a draft document establishing the guidelines for the new human resources EU initiative &ndash; EQUAL &ndash; which will run from 2000-6. Essentially, the EQUAL initiative aims to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market by developing the skills and employability of the unemployed and renewing and upskilling those already in the labour market, particularly those in the exposed or vulnerable sectors.</P>
    <P>The conclusion phase of the NOW projects also coincides with the Government's recent publication of the national development plan which lays the foundation for exploiting fully the current economic boom and for sharing in our economic success. The national development plan has allocated £9.9 million in expenditure on the employment and human resources operational development programme. The plan seeks to build on the learning and best practices from measures under the 1994-99 community support framework. The mainstreaiming of the outcomes of community initiatives, ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT, will receive particular attention. A key objective is to further enhance enterprise skills and access to employment through continuous and life long learning. It is expected that organisations and groups previously funded under the NOW programme and other strands of EMPLOYMENT would seek funding under a number of measures in the plan.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I would encourage projects <Col N="661" /> such as the community women's education initiative to exploit fully any opportunities available for continued support under the new community initiative and under other programmes announced the national development plan in the human resources and employment areas.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Inspector of Mental Hospitals Report.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the year ending 31 December 1998, published in November, reveals a serious and disturbing picture. It is an indictment of the State's treatment of one of the most vulnerable groups in our country &ndash; the mentally ill. Those patients have been neglected, ignored and stigmatised for decades. As of 31 December 1998, 5,110 patients were in psychiatric hospitals and acute units.</P>
      <P>The inspector expressed his concern at the lack of multi-disciplinary teams in many of the mental health services. It is not acceptable that, for example, one health board with four mental health services has no social worker in any of them. This has been repeatedly drawn to the Minister's attention yet no action has been taken. It is not acceptable that psychological services are poorly represented and in some cases non-existent. What plans, if any, has the Minister to deal with matter? It is unfair to ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach to respond to this issue, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>At a time of highly developed medical treatment in general hospitals, it is nothing short of sheer discrimination, bordering on abuse, that drug prescribing in some locations is often arbitrary and made without regard to appropriate clinical diagnosis. The inspector was concerned at the number of patients, particularly long stay patients, who are on numerous drugs simultaneously, often on high doses. In some instances, the prescription had not been reviewed for some time. Does the Minister accept that medication should be reviewed at frequent intervals and that failure to do so is a sign of serious negligence which should be investigated by his Department?</P>
      <P>The inspector reported an increasing number of sudden deaths in psychiatric hospitals, some of which were attributed to drug-related effects. Does the Minister agree that the description by Vincent Browne in <i>The Irish Times</i> of this gross abuse, is correct? He stated that &ldquo;the Inspector's comment implies that very serious crimes, either manslaughter or criminal negligence may have been committed&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical note taking and keeping medical records is an important tool in the management of modern medical systems. I am extremely <Col N="662" /> concerned at the inadequacy and quality of medical note taking in some mental health services.  This relates particularly to consultant input both on or shortly after admission to hospital and subsequent clinical reviews and progress. Surely this approach should not be tolerated? Will the Minister outline to the House the action he intends to take on foot of this information?</P>
    <P>There were 504 suicide victims in 1998, an increase of 14% on the previous years. One of the key recommendations of the National Task Force on Suicide was that steps should be taken to make the health services, including mental health services, more accessible to the public, particularly the young, who may perceive them as not readily available to address their needs at times of crisis. Psychiatric community services, especially in rural areas, are totally inadequate and are the Cinderella of the health services. There are inadequate day hospitals and community residential facilities for persons with psychiatric disorders. It is not acceptable that in some hospitals as many as half the acute psychiatric beds are occupied by persons who do not need such a high level of in-patient care. A major reason for this is the absence of appropriate alternative residential facilities.</P>
    <P>The services to our fellow citizens who are suffering from mental illness is disgraceful and is adding to the stigmatisation of people who are suffering from a psychiatric disorder. The Minister must, as a matter of urgency, deal with and respond to this scandal. The abuse of people is horrifying, particularly when it is done by the system to the most vulnerable citizens in our society, who deserve special vigilance and care. How we treat these citizens is a profound indictment of our society and our values.</P>
    <P>I refer to the situation in the mid-west. No progress has been made in implementing a development plan which would involve the gradual relocation of mental health services, which are currently on the campus of St. Joseph's Hospital. There is no objective to provide other services in the mid-west area.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the Minister of State responding to this matter, I am disappointed the Minister for Health and Children is not here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, sends his apologies. However, I will draw his attention to the Deputy's comments. Nobody in this House or in the country doubts Deputy Neville's sincerity or the great work he has undertaken, almost single-handedly, on these issues for many years. Most of his colleagues in the House admire the way he has done that. He has pioneered a genuine concern in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the year ending 31 December 1998 was laid before both Houses of the <Col N="663" /> Oireachtas on 5 November 1999. In his report the inspector noted the continuing decline in the number of patients in psychiatric in-patient facilities from 5,192 at the end of 1997 to 5,101 at the end of 1998. There were almost 26,000 admissions to these facilities in 1998, of which approximately 6,000 were first admissions. The proportion of patients being admitted to general hospital units continued to increase and in 1998 accounted for approximately one third of all admissions. A further 15% were admitted to private hospitals. The number of involuntary admissions at approximately 2,500 remained constant at 10%.</P>
    <P>A number of welcome developments were reported in many of the health board regions during 1998. Examples of these developments included the opening of new community residences in a number of the mental health services in the Eastern Health Board area, the purchase of the extensive day facility in Portlaoise town, the acquisition of further residential accommodation in the Clare mental health services and the opening of a refurbished residence in Strokestown, County Roscommon. Although the inspector acknowledged the significant progress that has been made in the provision of community mental health centres, day hospitals and community residential facilities for persons with mental health disorders, he stated that the rate of progress needs to be accelerated.</P>
    <P>During 1998 the inspectorate published the document, Guidelines on Good Practice and Quality Assurance in Mental Health Services, which stressed the areas of performance which were felt to be important for patient care and which needed improvement in some cases. The importance of patients' rights across a broad range of issues was stressed and the responsibility of mental health services in such matters was highlighted. The document was distributed to all mental health service providers.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by the inspector at the lack of multidisciplinary teams in many mental health services, particularly in the area of psychology and social work services. The Department provided additional resources to health boards in 1999 to enable some improvements in paramedical support to be put in place. It was hoped to continue with this initiative as resources permitted. On 1 December 1999 the Minister for Health and Children announced that an additional £1.4 million was being allocated in 2000 to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The problem of homeless mentally ill persons, particularly in large urban areas such as Dublin, was highlighted in the inspector's report. The Eastern Health Board had made efforts to address the problem by providing a residential unit for the homeless mentally ill in St. Brendan's Hospital and a new day service at Usher's Island in Dublin. The specialised outreach service for this group of people who <Col N="664" /> work closely with voluntary agencies was in its infancy but was considered an essential service. In response to the inspector's concerns, additional resources have been allocated to the Eastern Health Board for 2000 to provide an additional specialist team for the homeless service.</P>
    <P>On its publication, the Minister welcomed the inspector's report and acknowledged the crucial role the inspectorate, as an independent body, played in providing an accurate and detailed account of services in the mental health sector throughout the country. The Minister stressed the importance of publishing the inspector's reports as soon as possible in the year following inspection and said he had asked the inspectorate to finalise the 1999 report at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the inspector's report, controversy has arisen about the issue of sudden deaths occurring in the mental health services. In <i>The Irish Times</i> on 17 November one of its columnists drew attention to a statement contained in the report which noted the increasing number of sudden deaths in psychiatric hospitals, some of which were attributed to drug-related effects. From this statement the columnist drew some alarming conclusions. In the circumstances and in order to allay any anxiety that public comment on this matter may have caused to psychiatric patients or to their relatives or friends, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals felt it was important that his remarks be clarified.</P>
    <P>In his response the inspector states that it has been known for a long time that persons suffering from psychiatric illness had a higher mortality and poorer life expectation than the general population. This raised mortality is due to a variety of causes of death, some the consequence of health damaging lifestyles associated with psychiatric disorder, such as cigarette smoking, alcohol or drug abuse, faulty dietary habits and self-induced or community determined social exclusion. These factors result in greater mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancers and other less common causes of deaths. To these must be added sudden causes of death, such as suicide and deaths believed to be drug-related, both of which have increased in this country in recent years. These latter two causes of death are by statute reported to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals when they occur in psychiatric hospitals and units in general hospitals.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 sudden deaths among patients suffering from psychiatric illness have increased from 23 in 1983 to 36 in 1998. Of those deemed on clinical grounds and by coroners to have been due to suicide, the numbers have gone from 15 in 1983 to 20 in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Roaccutane, also known as Accutane, isotretintoin or 3-cis retinoic acid, is well <Col N="665" /> recognised as an effective therapy for treatment of severe acne. The precise mechanism of action of Roaccutane, however, is unknown. The licence for Roaccutane states that the drug is indicated for severe acne that is non-responsive to conventional therapy and is available as a hospital-only prescription. Therapeutic response to Roaccutane is usually excellent but, unfortunately, it is not free of side effects. It is, for example, a well known and potent teratogen. It also causes an increase in serum lipids. A Medline search of the scientific literature of Roaccutane therapy and its effects reveals a number of cases of psychological distress associated with the drug. Suicide and suicide attempts in association with Roaccutane therapy have also been reported.</P>
      <P>Concerns about the safety of Roaccutane have been raised in the past and in May 1998, data provided by the manufacturers, Roche, revealed that a total of 170 cases of suicide, suicide attempt or suicide ideation were reported as associated with the drug. It also reported at the same time that, overall, 40,000 adverse drug reactions were known to it but the nature of these adverse drug reactions was not made available.</P>
      <P>In February 1998, the FDA issued a talk paper declaring new safety information regarding Roaccutane as a result of adverse event reports which the agency had received. Almost one year prior to the US revision, the French product label was altered in March 1997 to include suicide attempt as a side effect of Roaccutane. It reads, &ldquo;In rare cases neuropsychological problems have been recorded &ndash; behavioural difficulties, depression, convulsions and suicide attempts&rdquo;. Revised warnings have been introduced in Ireland and Britain since 1998.</P>
      <P>A number of scientific papers have been published on the association between Roaccutane and depression. Lamberg in 1998 in the<i> Journal of the American Medical Association</i> published a paper entitled Acne drug depression warnings highlight the need for expert care; Aubin <i>et al</i> in 1995 in <i>Clinical Experimental Dermatology</i> wrote an article entitled Massive isotretinoin intoxication and Scheimal <i>et al</i> in 1990, in the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology</i>, wrote an article entitled Acute depression from isotretinoin. These are just some examples of the available scientific publications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the manufacturer of the drug, as of April 1999, remains that there is no scientific evidence of a link between Roaccutane, depression and suicide. It is worthy of note, however, that the British Government has granted legal aid to finance claims on civil actions against manufacturers in relation to psychiatric side effects of Roaccutane. This is likely to cost the British Government many millions in the financing of free legal fees, <Col N="666" /> scientific studies and the availability of professional witnesses.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that Roaccutane may be purchased in Ireland over the Internet? This is the same drug that, according to the manufacturers, should be available on hospital-only prescription and available only for severe acne. It is deeply disturbing that this drug can be ordered in this fashion, effectively without any control. It should be noted, however, that Roaccutane purchased over the Internet did contain a list of side effects and special precautions, including the following: &ldquo;Behavioural disorders or seizures have been observed. In the post-marketing period a number of patients have reported depression, psychosis and, rarely, suicide ideation, suicide attempts and suicide. Of the patients reporting depression, some reported that the depression subsided with the discontinuation of the treatment and re-emerged on resumption of treatment&rdquo;. This information is available with the product on sale in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure that the Irish Medicines Board will have available from the manufacturers of the drug the full list of adverse drug reactions reports held on the Roche database, to show the number and nature of side effects reported to be caused by this drug? Will the Minister make this information available to me and to other persons with an interest in the side effects of the drug?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister agree to set up an independent, scientific inquiry to review the side effects caused by Roaccutane, to interview users and their families who have experienced side effects from the use of the drug, to review the medical data, to report if present warnings should be significantly strengthened and to consider the introduction of some form of psychiatric monitoring of patients throughout treatment on Roaccutane?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland. Roaccutane (isotretinoin) is a vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of acne. In Ireland, it is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board for the treatment of severe acne that is unresponsive to other treatments, and its availability is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a consultant dermatologist.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board carried out a full review of the safety and efficacy of this product as part of the assessment of the renewal of the product authorisation in 1998 and also as a result of new safety information regarding the development of neuropsychiatric reactions, including depression and suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that the Irish Medicines Board has in the past monitored all available data on Roaccutane and continues to <Col N="667" /> do so, including reports of adverse reactions, which it reviews both internally with its experts and with the other European regulatory agencies. As a result of this, revised wording for inclusion in the prescribing information of the product outlining the current position regarding its use and warnings relating to the possible development of psychiatric reactions were agreed. The warnings refer to possible side effects, including depression, psychotic symptoms and of rare reports of suicide associated with Roaccutane. The revised warnings have been incorporated into the authorisation documents for the product and the company has circularised all physicians and pharmacists outlining the new warnings regarding the use of Roaccutane.</P>
    <P>There is a legal responsibility on the company, as a condition of its product authorisation, that it keep a record of reports of adverse effects associated with the use of the product and that it furnish the Irish Medicines Board with copies of any such reports of which it has a record or of which it is aware. A further condition of the authorisation requires that the company should inform the board of any information received by it which might alter the validity of the data provided in support of the authorisation, or which would further the understanding of the substance or its effects or may alter the directions for the use of the product.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Irish Medicines Board that it currently understands that all information on Roaccutane, required under the conditions applicable to its product authorisation, has been made available to the board by the company. At the same time, the board has held on-going discussions with the company regarding its pharmocovigilance responsibilities &ndash; the monitoring and reporting of adverse reactions &ndash; and it continues to monitor the functioning of the company's pharmacovigilance unit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> In addition, and at the request of the Irish Medicines Board, the manufacturer has recently initiated a post-marketing surveillance programme to monitor all patient usage of Roaccutane in Ireland. All data collected during this surveillance programme will be reviewed and analysed by the board and further regulatory action will be taken, as required.</P>
    <P>While I am aware of recent calls for an independent inquiry into the matter of adverse reactions to Roaccutane, I do not consider it necessary for me to establish or carry out any such inquiry into the matter at this stage, particularly as the Irish Medicines Board, an independent statutory body with a specific remit in this area, is already engaged in monitoring those adverse reactions reported to it.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Irish Medicines Board continues to actively monitor the safety profile of the product concerned and I am confident that the board will take any action that may be necessary having regard to the risk/benefit ratio of the product.</P>

      <QRef>[26005/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke): The independent review of railway safety in Ireland identified a number of options for the future regulation of railway safety in Ireland. My Department has been considering these options and consulted the Health and Safety Authority, CIE and the trade unions. While no definitive decision has yet been made on the future direction of railway safety regulation, I would like to briefly outline my preliminary views on the form and content of the proposed regulatory framework. I favour the establishment of a railway safety inspectorate, independent of my Department and with powers similar in nature to the Health and Safety Authority. The inspectorate would have the necessary powers of inspection, investigation and enforcement to allow it to carry out its functions.</P>
    <P>I also consider that it would be appropriate to adopt a safety case approach under which Iarnród Éireann, or any other railway or light railway undertaking, would be required to prepare a safety statement setting out its safety policies and systems and identifying hazards on its rail network together with the appropriate actions to deal with them. This safety statement, or safety case, would then form the basis for managing safety on the railway in a formal yet flexible manner. This approach has already been adopted by other countries in respect of their railways and is used for occupational safety under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989. It provides a flexible and responsive means of managing railway safety.</P>
    <P>These are initial proposals only. Further detailed consideration of a range of issues will be required before I bring firm legislative proposals before the House. I would welcome the views of all interested parties, including Members of this House, on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer subvention to CIE in 1999 is £108,884,000 and the company allocated it to the operating subsidiaries in the following manner. Iarnród Éireann, £93,950,000; Bus Átha Cliath, £9,244,000; Bus Éireann, £5,690,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> It has been the policy for some years to increase the subvention broadly in line with inflation so as to maintain its value in real terms. The subvention for 2000 has been set at £115,181,000, an increase of 6% over the 1999 figure, which is well in excess of the rate of inflation.</P>

      <P>ESB has a statutory obligation under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, to ensure the provision of an adequate supply of electricity to meet demand. I have no direct function in that matter. As the Deputy is aware, the electricity market will be open to competition from February 2000 in accordance with the provisions of the EU Electricity Directive. The ESB is currently in the process of bringing the final phase of its Poolbeg plant on stream which will provide an additional 160MW immediately and the IVO peat plant, which is scheduled to come into operation in December 2000, will provide another 120MW.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated in a letter to the chairman of the ESB on 1 December 1999, which I made public last week, the conditions under which I was pre<Col N="672" /> pared to approve of further capital expenditure by the ESB for the development of its proposed new 400MW gas fired plant at Ringsend. As the Deputy will be aware, a number of independent power producers have announced their plans to enter the Irish electricity market. I have every confidence that the electricity market will respond with the provision of the necessary capacity to meet rising customer demand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no contracts to be awarded for electricity generating stations for the approximate 28% of the electricity market to be opened to competition from 19 February next. Any independent supplier who wishes to compete in the eligible customer market would be required to apply for the necessary licence from the Commission for Electricity Regulation. The recent media reports to which the Deputy refers in his question concern the allocation of capacity in the natural gas network for the purpose of fuelling gas-fired power stations, rather than the award of contracts for the construction of power stations.</P>
      <P>Forecasts of final demand for natural gas indicate that there will be enough capacity in the natural gas network to meet that demand for the next four to five years. However, the amount of capacity which has been sought in applications to Bord Gáis Éireann significantly exceeds the capacity which is likely to be available in the short term. Most of the parties who have expressed an interest in building their own power stations when the electricity market is opened up to competition in the new year favour gas-fired stations. They will need to be certain that they will have access to the necessary capacity in the natural gas network in order to proceed with these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure that the electricity needs of the State can be met, I have decided that a fixed amount of capacity in the natural gas network will be reserved specifically for the purpose of fuelling new gas-fired power stations. A selection mechanism will be necessary to determine which of the prospective power producers should be given access to the available capacity in the natural gas network. The Attorney General has advised that, having regard to the provisions of the EU gas and electricity directives, it will be necessary that any proposed scheme for allocating this capacity be put on a statutory footing. My Department has conducted a public consultation on a range of options for allocating this capacity for completeness, the full range of available options was included in the consultation. Having considered <Col N="673" /> the views received, I have decided that capacity should be allocated through a selection mechanism based on an evaluation of planned commissioning dates for power plants. A draft Bill to provide for such a selection mechanism was agreed at Cabinet this morning and will be introduced to the House as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view that there is a need to continue to upgrade the DART service as part of the overall improvement in public transport services in the Dublin area. This Government is committed to ensuring that such development takes place.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that, over the 24 months to which he refers, there will be tangible results from the initiatives which we have already taken.</P>
      <P>This will include the completion of the work on the extension to Malahide next year, the opening of Barrow Street station in mid-2000 and the provision of improved services as well as additional rolling stock.</P>
      <P>The total number of DART carriages currently on order is twenty six. Delivery of ten of the carriages, co-funded under the EU Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999, will take place this month. The remaining 16 will be delivered during October-November 2000. These are being financed by the Exchequer and the EU.</P>
      <P>Following delivery, commissioning of the carriages takes approximately eight weeks and they will then be introduced into service immediately. They will increase the DART fleet from 80 to 106 carriages which will result in an increase in total passenger carrying capacity of 5,200 places or 33%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> The Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000 - 2006, prepared by the Dublin Transportation Office, proposed the phased purchase of an additional 46 DART carriages. The national development plan has now provided for the acquisition of these additional carriages as well as the lengthening of station platforms to cater for eight car trains and also the opening of new stations. These carriages will increase DART capacity by a further 40%.</P>

      <P>In June of this year, I indicated that a range of discounts which Aer Rianta had intended would cease on 30 June 1999 should continue in operation until 31 December 1999 but not after that date. I took that decision notwithstanding the fact that the European Commission had indicated that any extension of the discounts beyond 30 June 1999 would most likely lead to an assessment on the basis that they constitute State aid. My officials and the Commission are still in contact on this matter.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 46 and 48 on 3 November 1999, I believe that the next regulatory decision in relation to any revised charges regime should be taken by the independent regulator for Irish airports when established, rather than by me. Work on drafting the legislation to give statutory effect to the new regulator is under way and it would be my intention to establish the new regulatory regime as early as possible next year.</P>

      <Quest>the information given by the British authorities to the RPII in relation to each of more than 30 safety incidents at Sellafield in 1998 and 1999 and over 100 breaches of safety at the atomic weapons establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire in 1999.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>None of the safety incidents at Sellafield which occurred in 1998 and 1999 has radiological significance for Ireland. They would amount to on-site incidents with possible implications for the safety of workers. Under existing incident notification arrangements between the UK and Ireland, any on-site incidents at UK civil nuclear installations which affect workers' safety are notified to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. This notification would come from the UK's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, or the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and would involve an outline of the incident and the remedial actions that have been taken. The RPII, having considered the material received, would decide if the incident raises safety culture implications which would require further discussion with the NII or if they require further details. In such circumstances, the RPII would follow up the matter with the NII.</P>
      <P>I understand that as a consequence of an increase in minor incidents at Sellafield, the NII recently carried out an in depth audit of control and supervision procedures at the site. The report of this audit is expected to be completed early in the new year. I await the completion of this report with interest and will be keeping in touch with the UK Government regarding the findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a report in the <i>Observer</i> newspaper on 24 October last, that over 100 breaches of safety rules had occurred at the Aldermaston UK Ministry of Defence property in the previous 12 months. The RPII was informed by the NII <Col N="677" /> that it reviewed these breaches and advised the RPII that none have implications for public safety. The NII also advised the RPII that the more serious incidents are followed up by NII inspectors who take appropriate enforcement measures.</P>
    <P>While these particular incidents at Sellafield and the Aldermaston facility may not have any radiological safety significance for Ireland, they do, however, serve to highlight the risks associated with such operations and can, understandably, give rise to public concern here in Ireland. Ireland's concerns about safety incidents in the UK nuclear industry will continue to be raised with the UK authorities by my Department and the RPII in their regular contacts with their UK counterparts on nuclear safety matters.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as Aer Lingus is concerned, my strategic priority is to secure the company's future as a strong and viable airline providing air services with all our main tourism and export markets. An essential element in this regard is the airline's entry into a major strategic alliance. I am pleased to advise that Aer Lingus has finalised agreement for an alliance with American Airlines and British Airways. The airline has also recently been confirmed as a member of the Oneworld global airline alliance.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply of 3 November 1999, no decision has been made on an initial public offering, IPO, for Aer Lingus. However, the Government mandated myself and the Minister for Finance to engage in a process with the board of Aer Lingus and appropriate social partners to address Aer Lingus's funding requirements and possible sources of funding, including an IPO, and to submit proposals to Government thereafter. The process is nearing completion and I expect to report to Government shortly in the matter.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to previous parliamentary questions, she has satisfied herself that adequate electricity generating capacity exists to meet current and future requirements; the plans, if any, she has to ensure the availability of sufficient power supplies to meet domestic and industrial requirements between now and 2004; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question on 24 November 1999, I met the chairman of the ESB on 2 November 1999 about the electricity capacity situation. He gave me a categoric assurance that there would be no shortfall in the electricity supply during winter 1999 and 2000. I must accept the chairman's assurance. Regarding winter 2001, a number of interests have plans to build new generating plant to come on stream around that time.</P>
      <P>Regarding future power generation, work is already under way on two electricity stations which will increase electricity generating capacity over the next few years. The new gas unit at Poolbeg will increase capacity by 160MW, and is due to come on stream by the end of this year.  The new IVO plant at Edenderry will add 120MW of capacity, and is now due for completion in December 2000, over six months ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, introduced by me, 28% of the electricity market will be open to competition from February 2000, rising to 33% in 2003. This means that any interested party can apply to the Commission for Electricity Regulation for the necessary licences and authorisations to build new plant and start supplying eligible customers.</P>
      <P>In view of the very high level of interest shown by prospective entrants to the electricity market, there is every reason for confidence that sufficient capacity will be built to meet the economy's growing needs up until 2004.</P>

      <P>Ryanair's proposal of recent months involves opening new routes to Europe from Dublin and Shannon contingent on the company being allowed to invest £12 million in a new pier at Dublin Airport in return for a low cost charging regime of £1 per departing passenger.</P>
      <P>I have already stated in this House and elsewhere my belief that, as a general principle, any proposal for airline or other private funding of terminal facilities at Dublin Airport, even if it were structured on an equitable commercial basis between Aer Rianta and the airline concerned, could not be permitted exclusively for one airline. An opportunity to conclude such a deal with Aer Rianta, or alternatively to get from Aer Rianta airport charges arrangements of equivalent effect, would have to be offered to all airlines.</P>
      <P>As I have clearly indicated on numerous occasions, I do not personally favour the specific Ryanair proposal and while I have not discussed it with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Tánaiste would, of course, be aware of my publicly expressed views.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 99, 101, 102, 112, 113, 116 and 118 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of a top quality telecommunications system, covering both fixed and mobile services, is important for economic and social development as well as for economic growth and competitiveness. It is generally recognised that one of the best ways to bring this about <Col N="681" /> is to foster a pro-competition environment and a regulatory framework for the sector which stimulates ongoing investment in both infrastructure and services. Now with the advent of the full liberalisation of the Irish telecommunications sector and with growing competition, investment in telecommunications infrastructure is primarily a matter for the commercial judgment of network operators.</P>
    <P>However, recognising that, in certain parts of the country, competition alone may not be sufficient to generate the necessary investment in advanced telecommunications infrastructure, there is a role for State intervention to ensure that certain public interest objectives are met. Such intervention includes ensuring that a certain minimum level of telecommunications services is universally available by providing for the designation of a universal service provider as well as stimulating investment in areas which might not otherwise attract sufficient investment.</P>
    <P>For example, earlier this year I approved nine projects which support the development of broadband infrastructure in the regions, with a total investment of 55 million euros, including European Regional Development Fund support of 23 million euros. A number of additional projects are under consideration and I hope to be in a position to announce the outcome shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition, £120 million has been allocated under the National Development Plan 2000 &ndash; 2006 for further investment in advanced telecommunications infrastructure and my Department is currently drawing up plans for this investment.</P>
    <P>The Government has also successfully concluded a project by way of open competition whereby ownership has been acquired of connectivity on the global crossing international fibre optic system seamlessly linking Ireland to 24 European business centres and to the US at internationally competitive prices. This infrastructure will be in place by June 2000.</P>
    <P>As regards the further development of competition in the telecommunications sector, the work programme of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation is important in ensuring that this happens. This work programme includes the question of further licensing of mobile telephony services, including third generation mobile services.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, in April last, I announced my intention to prepare legislative proposals to provide the director with a firm basis for the regulation of the sector well into the next millennium. Work on these proposals is under way. This work will take into account the consultation process on the governance and accountability of regulation, which I initiated recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>Integrated ticketing aims to facilitate passengers who want or need to use two or more different services as part of their journey. It is designed to increase the attractiveness of public transport, to present it as an integrated product and to reduce the perceived inconvenience of interchange. It is part of this Government's ongoing commitment to providing better public transport services in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>A committee, comprising representatives from my Department, CIE, Dublin Bus, Iarnród Éireann, the LRT project team, and the Dublin Transportation Office was established in October 1998. Its objective is to make recommendations on an appropriate system for Dublin, taking account of the costs and benefits involved. I expect this report within the next few months.</P>
      <P>EU funding of just over £1 million is being provided for consultancy studies associated with the work of the committee and also for capital expenditure. I am satisfied that this money will be drawn down. The capital expenditure will be in respect of facilities at the Maynooth line rail stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> This is, of course, only preliminary work and the recently published National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides £12 million in respect of the anticipated expenditure in this period on equipment needed to introduce a new integrated ticketing system for the city.</P>
    <P>The Government recently decided that integrated ticketing should be introduced as quickly as possible during 2000 and an allocation of £1 million for ticketing equipment was announced in the budget. Once systems are designed and tested, I expect to see integrated ticketing introduced on a phased basis by all public transport operators in the city.</P>

      <P>I have not yet received the report of the advisers which were appointed jointly by myself and the Minister for Finance to assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's future strategic direction. I understand that the advisers will be submitting their report to me and to the Minister for Finance very shortly.</P>
      <P>Following the receipt of this report and consideration of its recommendations, I will consult with my Cabinet colleagues in the normal way and then report to Government with specific recommendations in regard to the future of Aer Rianta including proposals in relation to the Great Southern Hotels Group. It would not be appropriate for me at this point to speculate on what those recommendations will be.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that I have outlined recently to the House the considerable concern of the Government that a significant interruption of telecommunications services occurred on 19 November. I am aware of reports that it caused problems for many businesses as well as other telephone users.</P>
      <P>My Department have been in contact with Eircom and I have also met the chairman of Eircom to convey the Government's concern over what occurred. I have been informed by the company that it has undertaken a full review of its network with the help of its suppliers to identify the necessary actions to take in order to ensure that it does not happen again. I also understand that Eircom's suppliers have modified their testing procedures to ensure that the fault which caused the breakdown does not happen again.</P>
      <P>Providers of telecommunications services are subject to the general law relating to the supply of services and it is a matter for users of such services to avail themselves of the remedies available under the law in respect of losses suffered by them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision of 29 March 1999, which followed a lengthy and wide ranging consultation process, decided to implement new operational arrangements for the management, development and delivery of the national employment service function. These included: the assimilation of the local employment service, LES under FÁS, as a discrete component of a more integrated, dual-stranded national employment service, the other component being the existing FÁS employment service; the establishment of an employment service, advisory committee within FÁS which will have responsibility for advising the FÁS executive on the operation and development of all components of the national employment service function, including the LES; membership of the advisory committee to comprise the following representatives drawn from the main FÁS board: one Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, one Department of Fin<Col N="686" /> ance, one Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, one Department of Education and Science, one IBEC, one ICTU, one worker director and one FÁS executive representative; together with a representative each from INOU, PLANET, the representative body of the partnerships, ADM and the LES co-ordinators.</P>
    <P>Deliberations on how best to implement the Government decision in relation to the practical operational arrangements to assimilate the LES into FÁS are continuing in my Department and I will be seeking to ensure that these arrangements will create a more integrated and focused dual stranded national employment service, which will operate in a co-ordinated and complimentary manner. The new service will be able to optimise the resources at its disposal to target and engage with those most in need of assistance. The employment service will continue to be informed by local needs as set out in the partnership plans and appropriate liaison arrangements will need to be put in place to ensure effective consultation with the partnerships in the development of employment service plans at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has spent over £800,000 on various initiatives to increase awareness among businesses, and to encourage them to take action to ensure that their computer systems are Y2K compliant. This includes companies involved in the handling of dangerous substances. These initiatives include the Enterprise Ireland National Y2K Information Service, specifically geared to the needs of small companies. This service has been very broad based and many different avenues have been developed to get the message across. The preparation of contingency plans has been highlighted as a key element of a company's preparations throughout these promotional efforts.</P>
      <P>Surveys undertaken as part of the campaign show that awareness of the year 2000 computer problem is very high and that many companies now have taken steps to pursue the issue. The latest survey results show that 94% of Irish companies are either very confident or fairly confident that their businesses will be unaffected by the millennium bug or associated issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, is the State body charged with responsibility for the <Col N="687" /> administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the relevant legislation, it is the primary duty of every employer to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all employees, and that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their safety and health.</P>
    <P>The authority has undertaken an information campaign to alert employers to their duty in the specific context of possible year 2000 problems impacting on key workplace systems. The authority has also participated in an awareness campaign with the Small Firms Association. This involved participating in a nationwide lecture tour with other Y2K involved parties in which the authority encouraged employers to have contingency plans in place in the event of failure.</P>
    <P>During visits to workplaces, inspectors are bringing the Y2K issue to the attention of employers and such plans should form part of the risk assessment review which is regularly carried out by employers.</P>
    <P>The authority has published guidelines on this issue for use by interested parties. The guidelines are available free of charge from the HSA and are given out during inspection visits as appropriate. The authority also carried out a survey on chemical process industries and found that in general identification and awareness levels are high. The information relating to Y2K is available on the HSA website.</P>
    <P>I would also like to assure the Deputy that I am continuing to work to ensure that the Health and Safety Authority has sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its statutory functions. However, ultimate responsibility for the Y2K issue lies with the individual businesses and it is they who must ensure that their operations can continue safely and without interruption after the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Commission has issued a draft document establishing the guidelines for the new human resources EU initiative EQUAL which will run from 2000 to 2006. Essentially, the EQUAL initiative aims to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market by developing the skills and employability of the unemployed <Col N="688" /> and renewing and upskilling those already in the labour market, particularly those in the exposed or vulnerable sectors. EQUAL will address selected themes and is based on the four pillars of the employment action plans of the member states encompassing employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities between women and men. The indicative list is as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Employability</i>a)Facilitating entry and re-entry to the labour market in order to promote a labour market open to all,</P>
      <P>b)Combating racism in the workplace.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Entrepreneurship</i>c)Opening up the business creation process to all,</P>
      <P>d)Increasing job quality in the social economy, the third sector.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Adaptability</i>e)Developing inclusive workplace practices and continuing vocational training,</P>
      <P>f)Introducing information technologies, anticipating change and upgrading skills.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Equal opportunities for women and men</i>g)Developing new forms of work organisation to reconcile family and professional life,</P>
      <P>h)Reducing gender gaps and supporting job desegregation.</P>
      <P>Member states will be expected to choose at least one thematic field in each pillar. The initiative will operate within these thematic fields primarily through integrated projects in development partnerships on either a geographical or sectoral basis or a combination of both and incorporate a strong transnational element. The draft document will be submitted to the European Social Fund committee and the European Parliament in December 1999 and is expected to be published in the EU official journal by February 2000. The operational programme for Ireland, when drafted by my Department with the involvement of appropriate groups and organisations will, subsequently, be submitted to the European Commission in accordance with the terms of the European Social Fund regulations. It is expected that a public call for project proposals will take place in autumn 2000 with a view to project activity commencing late 2000 or early 2001.</P>

      <Quest> the measures, if any, she will put in place to attract industry to unemployment black spots outside Objective One areas, for example, eastern and southern regions, in view of the reduction in grant aid for industry set up in these areas after 2000; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The guiding principles underlying the European Commission approach to the rates of regional grant aid, recently announced, are to reduce the overall geographical coverage and level of aid to industry by member states. This should have the effect of reducing the scope for competitive bidding wars between member states or regions, and effecting a concentration of permitted aid in the lesser developed regions, thereby facilitating their development. The new guidelines provide that identification of aided regions, together with the limits on aid in each region, are to be decided on the basis of objective economic criteria.</P>
      <P>Under the new guidelines Ireland moves from being a single &lsquo;A' region for State aid purposes to being composed of an &lsquo;A' region &ndash; border, midland and western region &ndash; and five &lsquo;C' regions comprising the five regional authorities in the southern and eastern region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During negotiations with the European Commission the economic structure of the south-west, mid-west and south-east and their problems were specifically recognised. As a result, the level of aid for these regions at the end of 2003 has been <Col N="690" /> set at the maximum allowed for a Community &lsquo;C' region, i.e. 20%, with a further top-up of 10% for SMEs and is higher than regions such as Dublin and the mid-east which have benefited comparatively better from recent economic growth. A table setting out the aid levels for each region from 2000 follows this reply.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed on the industrial development agencies &ndash; IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland &ndash; the crucial importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment opportunities throughout the country. The achievement of a better regional distribution of jobs across the country requires a strong co-operative approach between the agencies, the local authorities and infrastructure-service providers, including those of skills training. While the new regional aid guidelines dictate that the industrial development agencies must apply differentials in financial supports to companies located in the two new regions, the level of expertise and assistance will be equally available to all the regions.</P>
    <P>I am also confident that the major infrastructural investment programme envisaged in the national development plan will make a decisive difference in the capacity of the regions to compete for mobile investment projects.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> An Irish Consulate was established in Cyprus and the current Honorary Consul was appointed in 1987 on the closure of the Irish Embassy, which had been temporarily located in Nicosia after the embassy in Beirut had to be closed for security reasons.</P>
    <P>The criteria which apply to the establishment of consulates headed by honorary consuls and to honorary consular appointments generally and which applied in this case were the numbers of Irish citizens living in the country, the potential for developing economic relations and the need for assistance for the non-resident embassy, in Athens, in arranging official visits and a professional or business person who is well established and has good contacts with people in the political, administrative and business fields.</P>
    <P>As in this case, honorary consuls are normally appointed initially for periods of three years and, if they perform satisfactorily, the appointments are extended. Appointments made since 1995 are extendable for periods of five years after the initial three-year period, so each such appointment is reviewed every five years.</P>

      <P>Following the Cologne European Council, and in light of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has been examining how it can have a more effective role in the conduct of Petersberg Tasks, and also in non-military aspects of crisis management. The Cologne European Council mandated the General Affairs Council to consider how the Western European Union's Petersberg Task functions could be adapted and brought into the EU to fulfil its responsibilities under the Amsterdam Treaty in the area of Petersberg Tasks. As I made clear in the Dáil in an answer to questions on 2 November, this approach emphasises the Petersberg Tasks but leaves the Western European Union's Article V mutual defence clause to one side. Nor does the approach set out at Cologne involve nuclear matters. Moreover, the Cologne declaration makes clear that the different status of member states in regard to collective defence guarantees will not be affected. The Finnish <Col N="693" /> presidency will submit a progress report to the Helsinki European Council.</P>
      <P>The approach agreed at Cologne should be distinguished from a merger of the Western European Union as an institution, including its Article V clause, into the EU. Incorporation of Article V is simply not relevant to what the EU is trying to do, which is to focus on the Petersberg Tasks and not issues of mutual defence.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department that all transport operators, and in particular State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within the overall resources available to them. My Department also strongly supports environmentally friendly public transport. The allocation of Exchequer funding for public transport services takes account of these policies.</P>
      <P>By the end of 1999 it is expected that Dublin Bus will have approximately 33 accessible buses in operation and from the year 2000 all new buses purchased by Dublin Bus will be low floor and fully accessible.</P>
      <P>The recently published national development plan includes significant initiatives in relation to the accessibility of public transport, including the establishment of a public transport accessibility committee to advise in relation to the accessibility of public transport for mobility impaired and disabled people and a requirement that each CIE operating company establish an accessibility unit and appoint a full-time accessibility officer. In addition to including accessibility requirements in relation to new investment, the plan also provides £10 million to part-finance accessibility improvements to existing public transport infrastructure and facilities not otherwise benefiting from investment under the plan.</P>
      <P>My Department has allocated a sum of £20,000 to part fund a trial, which commenced in September 1999, involving the use by Dublin Bus of a single deck bus fuelled by liquid petroleum gas (LPG). In addition, Dublin Bus, in a joint venture with Bord Gáis Éireann, is operating, on a trial basis, a single deck bus using compressed natural gas (CNG). Any decision on the more general use of such alternative fuels must await the outcome of such trials. There are also a number of operational issues which would need to be examined by Dublin Bus prior to the use of such fuels.</P>

      <P>The board of Aer Rianta submitted a report to me on 15 April last on the future strategic direction of the company in which they sought the authority to exit from the Great Southern Hotels, in a manner determined through a consultative process with the relevant stakeholders.</P>
      <P>Over the past few months I have met and consulted with the staff of all the Great Southern Hotels. I advised them that my main consideration would be, of course, to find the right future for the Great Southern Hotels in a way that will also be right for the staff and right for the Irish tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The board of Aer Rianta retained Arthur Andersen consultants to examine all the options for the future of the Great Southern Hotel Group. They have also appointed Mr. Phil Flynn to act as facilitator with the trade unions as part of the process.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104, 105 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>The record economic growth that the country has experienced in the past five years and the forecast for continued growth are creating a need for the provision of additional infrastructure in the areas of electricity and gas.</P>
      <P>A report entitled Generation Capacity Requirements to 2005 was published by ESB in consultation with my Department in October 1998. That report projected that additional electricity generating capacity in excess of 200 megawatts was required by winter 2001 and that over 800 megawatts would be needed by 2005.</P>
      <P>Work is already under way on two electricity stations, which will increase electricity generating capacity over the next few years. The new gas unit at Poolbeg will increase capacity by 160 megawatts and is due to come on stream by the end of this year. The new IVO plant at Edenderry will add 120 megawatts of capacity, and is now due for completion in December 2000, more than six months ahead of schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From February 2000, 28% of the electricity market will be open to competition, rising to 33% in 2003. Any interested party, including the ESB, <Col N="698" /> will be able to apply to the Commission for Electricity Regulation for the necessary licences and authorisations to build new plant and start supplying eligible customers.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a number of entities, apart from the ESB, have signalled their intention to build new electricity plant under the provisions of the EU electricity directive.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the letter I issued to the chairman of ESB on 1 December 1999, which set out the conditions under which I would be prepared to give approval for further capital expenditure by the ESB on its proposed 400 megawatts gas fired plant at Ringsend.</P>
    <P>The existing electricity interconnector has a capacity of 250 megawatts and is already being used by the ESB as required to meet demand. The Deputy will be aware of a recent decision to increase the planned Northern Ireland-Scotland interconnector from 250 megawatts to 500 megawatts to come onstream later in 2001.</P>
    <P>In regard to gas, based on forecasts of final demand for natural gas, there is adequate capacity in the natural gas network, subject to some development of the on-shore network, to meet final demand for the next four or five years. However, a new interconnector or a new source of gas supply will be required by October 2004 at the latest.</P>
    <P>In late 1997 my Department and BGE jointly commissioned a study of natural gas demand and related infrastructural requirements to the year 2025. The consultants examined a range of options and recommended the provision of a second Scotland-Ireland interconnector as the optimal solution on cost and other grounds. Since the study was launched there have been a number of developments including the possibility of a commercial gas find in the Corrib field, the interest shown by a consortium in the provision of a North-South interconnector and by other parties in the provision of additional gas pipelines to and within Ireland.</P>
    <P>My Department engaged economic consultants to undertake an economic evaluation of the various supply options proposed under the gas 2025 study and the other possibilities that I mentioned above. The consultants confirmed the findings of the gas 2025 study that a second Scotland-Ireland interconnector, parallel to the existing interconnector, was the preferred choice. However, they recommended that a decision on future supply infrastructure should not be taken until the position regarding the prospect of the commercial development of the Corrib field is clear.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, BGE is proceeding with plans to upgrade the existing interconnector to its ultimate design capacity. This involves upgrading existing compression facilities and construction of additional facilities.</P>
    <P>Although, there is adequate capacity in the natural gas network to meet forecast final demand for the next four or five years, BGE has received applications for capacity in the natural gas network for the purposes of power pro<Col N="699" /> duction which, in aggregate, significantly exceed the capacity that is available in the immediate to short term.</P>
    <P>In order to meet expected increased demand levels for electricity from the industrial, commercial and residential sectors, I have decided that the available capacity in the natural gas network will be reserved specifically for the purpose of fuelling new gas-fired power stations and will be allocated to selected power producers.</P>
    <P>This morning I met Sir Reg Empey, the newly appointed Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive, and we had a broad ranging discussion on issues of mutual interest. In the specific area of energy, we agreed that it would be very helpful to mark this historic event on this island and to give concrete expression to this historic period of change on this island by a series of practical decisions. We have decided, therefore, to deepen the co-operation that already exists and to encourage the grid operators on both sides of the border to move ahead with their plans for the upgrading of the electricity interconnector and the reinforcement of the electricity system on both sides of the Border.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> As the Deputy will be aware a number of other independent power producers have announced their intention to enter the Irish electricity market and are understood to be developing their respective projects.</P>
    <P>In view of the very high level of interest shown by prospective entrants to the market, there is every reason for confidence that sufficient capacity will be built to meet the economy's growing needs.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for an early retirement pension on 12 July <Col N="704" /> 1999. Due to the volume of work a backlog has arisen in the processing of applications. The backlog is being addressed by local office staff in conjunction with other priority work.</P>
      <P>I would point out, however, that in no case does the processing time result in a financial loss to a retiring farmer. The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 62 animals, including 26 dairy cows, under the 1999 cattle headage scheme. Since only ten dairy cows are eligible for payment under this scheme, the grant was calculated on the basis of 46 animals. The grant of £1046.00 due under this scheme was recouped by my Department against an over-payment which has occurred under the rural environment protection scheme.</P>

      <P>The herdowner in question experienced a large number of losses of both young calves and dairy cows following the importation of livestock from another member state of the European Union. My Department's veterinary laboratory service, VLS, has been involved in investigating the problem in consultation with the herdowner's private veterinary practitioner. This involvement included two herd-investigation visits by research officers of the VLS; post mortem examination of samples from 15 calves and five cows from the herd at Kilkenny regional veterinary laboratory; examination of milk samples; examination of a large number of various clinical samples submitted from animals still in the herd; advice during the visits and by phone and by letter to both the practitioner and herdowner.</P>
      <P>The Department has identified a number of different diseases in the herd, including calf scour, pneumonia, lameness and mastitis caused by salmonella dublin, cryptosporidia, pasteurella haemolytica and mycoplasma bovis, M. bovis. These findings have been communicated to the private veterinary practitioner. The diagnostic and advice service of my Department's veterinary laboratory service continues to be available to the herdowner and the private practitioner.</P>
      <P>As I conveyed in my reply to Question No. 115 on 1 June last, M. bovis is relatively common in this country and in other member states of the European Union. Over the past four years 18% of total bovine pneumonia cases presented to the Department's regional veterinary laboratories were diagnosed as M. bovis positive. I also indicated in that reply that M. bovis is not a notifiable disease and that my Department is accordingly not involved in any scheme of depopulation or eradication.</P>
      <P>In relation to the disease risks associated with imported animals, it is the policy of my Department to recommend that herdowners source their livestock imports from reputable suppliers and to isolate all purchased animals, particularly imported stock, for as long as possible. A minimum of four weeks is recommended during which time the animals should be closely monitored for signs of disease. If any disease is suspected, they should continue to isolate all the purchased animals and consult their veterinary surgeon for advice.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 142 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was brought to public attention recently when canned meats were located in Clondalkin, County Dublin with a best before date of end February 1997 stamped on them. <Col N="710" /> They were being sold as pet food, even though such designation did not appear on the label.</P>
    <P>The information available to my Department indicates that the company in question produced different products using different recipes intended for export to the Russian market. The cans carrying an expiry date beyond the sell-by date were surplus product produced during the years 1993 to 1996, which had been stored by the company. They were then sold off as pet food. The company, when contacted about the incident, withdrew the product from sale.</P>
    <P>The product in question was produced in an approved cannery plant and the inspections carried out by my Department at the plant during the course of production are aimed at ensuring that the product is fit for human consumption under the relevant food safety legislation. As regards the content of the cans, samples were analysed by the State laboratory at the request of my Department. The analysis shows that the cans contain a total meat content of 46.6% by weight. The laboratory has indicated that because of the method of preparation of this product which involves high pressure and temperature treatment it is not possible for it to determine which type of meat is predominant nor can it reliably determine the percentage meat by species in this cooked product.</P>
    <P>The product also included MRM, mechanically recovered meat, which is residual meat recovered from bones of slaughtered animals and poultry. MRM has been permitted for use in human food under EU and national legislation for many years. This process is subject to specific public health requirements. In particular, specific regulations were introduced in 1996 to prevent the inclusion in MRM of specified bovine tissues considered as having a risk of harbouring BSE infectivity in affected cattle.</P>
    <P>The labelling of products and issues relating to retail sale are primarily matters for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and for the appropriate health board.</P>

      <P>The pesticide control laboratory has been testing-monitoring samples of pork and beef for PCB residues since 1982. The results are contained in the report of the Department's national monitoring programme for pesticide residues in food which is published each year. As regards dioxins the position is that analyses of samples, when required, are carried out at officially approved laboratories in other countries. The establishment of a dedicated laboratory in this country to carry out dioxin analysis is under active consideration at present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>The international pigmeat market has been experiencing serious difficulties over the past year or so due to the combination of over-supply of pigs and substantially reduced demand in the traditional import markets of Russia and the Far East. Ireland's pigmeat sector has not been immune from these developments.</P>
      <P>In response to the serious effects of this situation on the incomes of Irish producers, I negotiated increased support arrangements at EU level including substantial export refund increases, a generous subsidy for private storage of pigmeat and a major food aid package to Russia, which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. Despite the positive effects of these measures, the situation is still not satisfactory and there is much more ground to be covered in relation to improving the income levels of producers. In this regard, I have raised the weak market situation at the most recent EU Agriculture Council meeting and, along with a number of other member states requested further market support to be put in place. I am continuing to press the matter at EU level.</P>
      <P>At national level, I had meetings recently with the feed suppliers and the banks to ensure they did all in their power to support producers at this time. I met also with the pigmeat processors to ensure that everything possible was being done in terms of slaughtering schedules and marketing initiatives to lessen the adverse effects of the market weakness on the primary production sector. In terms of processing capacity, I have asked Enterprise Ireland to examine the situation as a matter of urgency and to consider the current structure of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> I am particularly aware of the difficulties being experienced by certain producers in the Border regions, who suffered losses as a result of the fire at a processing plant in Northern Ireland. I have been in contact with the Commission in relation to these producers and have put certain ideas to Commissioner Fischler. While there are serious constraints arising from the EU state aids provisions, contact with the Commission is nevertheless ongoing.</P>

The estimated number of social groups was 800. Based on biological information, the mean group size was estimated at 5.9 adults per group. This gave an estimated badger population of 4,720 in Waterford. The variation in the population from year to year is not known, but is unlikely to be of major proportions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the income difficulties being experienced by sheep producers at the present time. These difficulties are due to the relatively low prices paid by processors for lamb for much of the year, particularly since Easter. The low prices stem largely from increased supplies of UK lamb and somewhat higher slaughterings here also. The increased supplies in the UK have depressed returns from the French market which is our single most important and this in turn has been reflected in lower prices here. The ongoing renationalisation of the French market is also a factor as are the continuing problems in Russia which has substantially reduced prices for lambskins. The market has, however, firmed considerably over the past number of weeks mainly due to stronger demand in France and prices are now 24% higher than at the same time last year, although on average prices for the current year are 8% lower than in 1998.</P>
      <P>I accept that the ewe premium system fails to reflect the disparity in prices between member states and therefore, even allowing for differences between production systems in member states, does not support the income of producers in an equitable manner throughout the union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have on a number of occasions pointed out to the Commission the deficiencies in the sheepmeat regime in this respect and raised the matter most recently at the November agriculture council. At that meeting I outlined the serious income situation facing sheep producers at the present time and the failure of the ewe premium system to properly compensate Irish producers because of the lack of convergence of prices across the European Union. In particular, I called on Commissioner Fischler to take urgent action to address these issues, including by way of the temporary suspension of the stabiliser or through the payment of a supplementary premium in member states where prices are significantly below the EU average. Apart from the United Kingdom, I received no support from other member states. As far as the extensification premium is concerned, I have also raised this matter with the Commission on a number of occasions in recent <Col N="719" /> years. I have also recently asked the Commission to introduce a staggered retention period, beginning on the day after an application is lodged, for the ewe premium. Commissioner Fischler has indicated that he intends to review the current regime next year which is an important development.</P>
    <P>I also accept that New Zealand imports can create difficulties on the EU market and both I and my French colleague have maintained pressure at EU level to limit the effects.</P>
    <P>As far as headage payments are concerned, under transitional measures the existing sheep headage scheme will continue to apply in year 2000. The details of the scheme which will apply following the changeover to an area based scheme from the year 2001 has not yet been formulated. Discussions will take place with the farming organisations before any final decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>I think that it is worthwhile to remember that, in spite of all its defects, the ewe premium system does in fact provide important income support to Irish producers amounting to £110 million per annum with a further £22 million coming from the headage payments under the Structural Funds. This is a substantial amount of money and, while I am fully committed to securing improvements in the system, we have to acknowledge that the regime is seen to be relatively expensive by the Commission and other member states.</P>

      <P>Pensions paid under the scheme of early retirement from farming, along with certain other payments, were reduced by approximately 5.055% when the Irish pound was revalued against the euro on the introduction of the single European currency.</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers have agreed that compensation may be paid for this reduction. However, the approval of the European Commission is required before payment can be made. While my Department has been pursuing the issue as a matter of urgency, it has not been possible to secure the Commission's approval as early as had been hoped. It is now hoped that formal approval will be received by the end of this month and payment will then be made at the earliest date.</P>

      <P>The agreement on agriculture concluded in 1994 as part of the Uruguay round agreement under the auspices of GATT, now renamed the World Trade Organisation, commits WTO members to resume negotiations for the continuation of the agricultural trade liberalisation process in 1999. The aim of the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999 was to define the scope of a new round of negotiations, including non-agricultural issues. The conference was adjourned without reaching agreement and without a date being set for its resumption. The negotiations on agriculture are, in any event, provided for in the 1994 agreement on agriculture and will be based on Article 20 of that agreement. Article 20 requires that account be taken of the experience and effects of implementing commitments agreed in 1994, non-trade concerns, special and differential treatment of developing countries and the objective to create a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system. Ireland will be participating in the negotiations as a member of the EU.</P>
      <P>The EU already grants preferential access to its markets for a wide range of agricultural products from developing countries mainly through its generalised scheme of preferences and the Lomé Convention and it has already proposed that the WTO should enter into a commitment to ensure duty-free market access no later than the end of the new round of negotiations for essentially all products exported by the least developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its September meeting, the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers accepted the need to ensure that the concept of the multifunctional role of agriculture is acknowledged and given due recognition in the WTO negotiations. With regard to the need to provide technical support <Col N="726" /> for developing countries, I am aware that FAO is providing such support to assist these countries. In addition, the WTO organised a seminar on trade and development issues earlier this year, while more recently FAO held a similar meeting specifically on agriculture, trade and food security. These efforts are indications of a recognition in the international community of the importance of trade issues to food security, as was also underlined in the conclusions of the World Food Summit &ndash; WFS &ndash; in 1996. The Government fully shares that perspective and participates actively in the follow-up process to the WFS, which provides a mechanism for international consultation on food security.</P>
    <P>On 1 December in Seattle, Ireland signed, subject to ratification, the agreement establishing an advisory centre for developing countries on WTO law. The centre will provide advice and assistance for developing countries &ndash; in particular the least developed countries &ndash; in defending their trade rights. Finally, while I would be open to contact from representative organisations in developing countries, consultation with their own Governments, which will participate in the WTO negotiations, would be the most appropriate action in most cases.</P>

      <P>If the taxpayer returns to work in the current tax year and his total income for the year, including his and his wife's social welfare pensions, does not exceed £13,000, he will not be liable to pay income tax. According to the information available to the Inspector of Taxes, the taxpayer and his wife have social welfare income of £8,466. This would allow the taxpayer to earn a further £4,534 in the current tax year, which ends on 5 April 2000, without incurring an income tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the taxpayer's earnings in the current tax year were to exceed £13,000 but not exceed £15,700, marginal relief would apply. Under mar<Col N="729" /> ginal relief, income in excess of £13,000 would be taxed at the rate of 40%. Although this is higher than the standard rate of 24%, the taxpayer would pay less tax than if his liability were to be calculated under the normal system of tax-free allowances. If his total income were to exceed £15,700, marginal relief would no longer be of any benefit to the taxpayer and he would be taxed under the normal system of tax-free allowances.</P>

      <P>During any year, the Central Bank receives a high number of small value cheques drawn on foreign banks from Government Departments-offices for crediting to the Exchequer. The bank has informed me that there has been no change to the specified criteria for accepting these items and that it continues to accept all items lodged by Departments as agreed some years ago.</P>
      <P>However, because of the technical features and value of these cheques, in many cases, the foreign bank charges incurred by the bank and its own administrative costs in collecting value are actually greater than the face value of the cheque. In order to reduce the potential losses to the bank-Exchequer of handling these cheques, an initiative was taken in 1995 by Departments in consultation with the bank to try and resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>What the bank has now done is that it has indicated informally to Departments that it may be necessary to review this issue in the new year.</P>

      <Quest>if the correct tax free allowances have issued to a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny for the past two financial years; the reason this person paid the higher rate of tax in early 1999; and if he will have a rebate paid, if in order.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, according to the information available to the inspector of taxes, the taxpayer is in receipt of all the tax-free allowances to which he is entitled in the current tax year.</P>
      <P>In the 1998-99 tax year the taxpayer was taxed under the marginal relief system. In that year the income tax exemption limit for a single person under 65 years of age was £4,100. If the taxpayer's income was slightly above this limit, marginal relief applied which meant that the tax due on the taxpayer's income in excess of £4,100 was charged at the rate of 40%. Although this is higher than the standard rate of 24%, the taxpayer paid less tax than he or she would have done if he or she had been taxed under the normal system of tax-free allowances. If the taxpayer would like the inspector to carry out a review of his income tax liability for 1998-99, he should send his P60 for that year to the inspector in the Kilkenny tax office.</P>
      <P>In 1997-98 the taxpayer's income was less than the exemption threshold and no tax was deducted from him in that year.</P>

      <P>The rate for DIRT will be reduced to 22% in line with the standard rate of income tax effective from 6 April next. A reduced rate of DIRT of 20% applies in respect of special savings accounts and special investment accounts subject to a maximum investment of £75,000 in either case. The tax deducted, whether at 20% or 22%, is treated as satisfying the individual's full liability to income tax and capital gains tax where relevant.</P>
      <P>Disabled persons or individuals over 65 years and their spouses can claim a refund of DIRT if their total income including interest income is below their income tax exemption threshold. For the tax year commencing on 6 April 2000 the exemption threshold for over 65s will be £7,500 for single people and £15,000 for couples.</P>

Therefore, it is not open to me to remove VAT from telephone services used by any particular category such as old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>However, pensioners and others in receipt of the free telephone allowance do not pay VAT on the rental units which are the subject of the allowance because the VAT is paid by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

The power can only be used by duly authorised Revenue officers.</P>
      <P>The section makes provision, <i>inter alia, </i>for an authorised officer, in the exercise of his or her powers under section 905, to require any person whom he or she has reason to believe has information relating to any tax liability to give the authorised officer all reasonable assistance including providing information and explanations or furnishing documents in regard to any person.</P>

It would accordingly be very difficult to get formal EU Commission approval for any extension to the qualifying period.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>The increase in the numbers of cases of the conditions referred to may be attributed to several factors, such as improvements in surveillance and reporting, changes in lifestyle, lack of hygiene awareness, changes in food technology and its control and increased international travel and commerce. The trend towards sourcing foods from ever more distant countries lengthens the food chain, which may increase the possibility of foodborne disease and may expose consumers to new pathogens.</P>
      <P>When the new departments of public health were established in health boards in 1995/6, the need to improve collaboration and communication with microbiologists and environmental health officers was identified as a priority. This improved co-operation has contributed to an increase in notifications of food poisoning incidents.</P>
      <P>As a result of changes in lifestyle, many more people now eat outside the home, often from &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; or takeaway premises. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which was established in January 1999, has informed my Department that food poisoning outbreaks in 1998 were associated mainly with catering establishments such as restaurants, hotels or institutions. The authority has indicated that in its opinion most of these outbreaks were easily preventable, having arisen mainly from inappropriate storage, inadequate heating and/or cross-contamination.</P>
      <P>As there are indications that fundamental principles of food hygiene are not always being observed, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has identified this issue as a key priority in its work programme and has initiated a number of educational campaigns in this area.</P>

      <P>The increased level of notifications of bacterial meningitis and related conditions in recent years is in part attributable to the greatly increased awareness among health professionals and the general public, as well as improved techniques for diagnosis of the condition. Nonetheless, while there continues to be much research in relation to meningitis, it is not fully understood why Ireland experiences such a different pattern of disease to other countries in Europe and elsewhere. It should be noted that, despite the increased incidence of meningitis, there has not been a corresponding increase in mortality from this condition.</P>

      <Quest>if patients without medical card cover are entitled to public hospital services for the removal of wisdom teeth where this treatment is not available in private dental practices; if this service is available to patients in all health board areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current research in the UK suggests that a widespread practice has developed in the dental profession there of extracting wisdom teeth inappropriately. The research suggests that it would be more clinically appropriate to avoid extraction of wisdom teeth where they are free of pathology. Wisdom teeth may be extracted by a general den<Col N="741" /> tal practitioner following the guidelines set down by the Dental Council, for example, as to the use of general anaesthetic where required, or the patient may be referred to a hospital where oral surgery services are provided.</P>
      <P>Patients referred to hospital for the extraction of wisdom teeth have eligibility for public hospital services. However, hospital oral surgery services are not yet fully developed. Accordingly, many health boards have decided that the most equitable solution, pending further development of the services, is to confine hospital oral surgery services to priority cases and to medical card holders.</P>
      <P>Extraction of wisdom teeth is not normally regarded as a priority treatment requirement and patients who are without medical cards are asked to make private arrangements with one of the dental hospitals or a suitable private practitioner. Where arrangements are so made with a private practitioner, insured persons may have eligibility under the dental treatment benefit scheme. Persons who do not have medical card entitlement may also take out private health insurance to safeguard them against costs in the event of elective hospital treatment.</P>
      <P>Under the dental health action plan, I have approved a number of consultant oral surgeon posts for health boards and the boards concerned are endeavouring to fill existing vacancies. I also recently gave my consent to the setting up by the Dental Council of a register of dental specialists which would recognise a dental speciality in oral surgery. These developments will facilitate the creation and recruitment of a health board grade of specialist in oral surgery and will lead to a steady increase in the availability of oral surgery services nationally.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a family's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though the family's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that their medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the <Col N="743" /> chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>There are a number of income sources which are not taken into account when assessing applicants' income. These include blind welfare allowance, carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and supplementary welfare allowance. Social welfare benefits such as disability benefit, invalidity pension and unemployment benefit are not excluded income in this respect.</P>

      <P>I understand from the board that there are eight speech and language therapists and one principal speech and language therapist in the Mayo community care services. Three speech and language therapists are employed by the Western Care Association.</P>
      <P>Speech and language therapy services are provided to 240 children through Western Care. The board provides services to a further 900. I am informed by the board that there is a waiting list of approximately 160 children for this service.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question concerning the average recommended number of sessions of speech and language therapy recommended for children with Down's syndrome, this would depend on the extent of each child's language delay when compared with performance skills. It is, therefore, not possible to give an exact reply to this question.</P>

      <P>There have been five meetings of the national suicide research group since it was established in 1998. The meetings took place on the following dates: 2 June, 1998 &ndash; inaugural meeting; 20 October, 1998; 26 January, 1999; 14 April, 1999 and 14 October, 1999. The next meeting takes place on 8 December, 1999 in Limerick.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards was central to the strategy to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide and was a core recommendation of the final report of the national task force on suicide. Membership of the group includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research. The main responsibilities of the suicide research group are to review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, to co-ordinate research into suicide and to make appropriate recommendations to the chief executive officers of health boards.</P>
      <P>A researcher-co-ordinator has recently been appointed by the group and is currently undertaking a full review of activities in 1999 and preparing a service plan for 2000. The national co-ordinator is facilitating and supporting the work of the regional co-ordinators in each health board.</P>
      <P>The suicide research group is in the process of inviting different research groups to make presentations. One of these, the National Suicide Research Foundation, is being funded to carry out a national study on parasuicide and will be working very closely with the group throughout the period of research. At each meeting, the group reviews research work being undertaken by the public health departments in each health board area and examines their progress reports to identify successful initiatives. A review of the new Garda report forms &ndash; Form 104 &ndash; which are sent to the central statistics office is also being undertaken.</P>
      <P>I understand the National Suicide Research Group will forward a copy of its work programme for 2000 to my Department within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>My Department sought total figures on the number of persons awaiting in-patient treatment on 31 October 1999, some days after the ending of the nurses dispute. These figures, as shown on the following table, indicate that there was a total of 37,326 on the waiting list on 31 October, an increase of 3,771 over the September figure.</P>
      <P>Since the conclusion of the nurses dispute my Department has been working with the health agencies to ensure that the services to patients return to normal as quickly as possible. This includes measures to address any backlogs emerging as a result of the industrial action.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that services to patients are delivered as efficiently and effectively as possible and that all agencies work intensively to achieve normal services following the recent industrial action.</P>

      <P>The General Register Office archive conversion project, which is currently under way in Roscommon, involves the capture of the records of more than 150 years of births, deaths and marriages and associated indexes. The project, was initially established with 40 FÁS trainees and 16 civil servants. As the Deputy will be aware, the com<Col N="748" /> munity employment scheme was intended to meet a particular need on a temporary basis. This scheme ended during the summer and the Department of Health and Children is examining how best to proceed with the archive conversion project and is having discussions with the Department of Finance and other relevant bodies. The conversion of the archive involves the scanning of the historical records of the office from 1845 to date and the conversion of the associated indexes to an electronic format. The Deputy will appreciate that this is a major and complex undertaking. It is now projected that this phase may be finalised by the end of 2001. The second phase of the project, which will take place on completion of the computerisation of the archive, will involve the transfer of the administrative sections of the General Register Office to Roscommon.</P>

    <P>Significantly increased funding has been made available in the last few years to improve the non-national road network. Some £237 million has been allocated from the local government fund for non-national roads in 1999, an increase of over £37 million or nearly 19% on the original 1998 allocation and £59 million or 33% on the 1997 figure.</P>
    <P>Non-national roads grants are allocated to local authorities under a number of different grant categories. The amount allocated to individual county councils under most grant categories is determined on a pro-rata mileage basis. Grants under the restoration improvement category are determined on the basis of mileage and on the basis of need established by the pavement condition study.</P>
    <P>The selection of projects for grant allocations under the EU co-financed scheme depends on their compliance with EU eligibility criteria, the need to prioritise projects, competing demands from other local authorities and the total funds available for the scheme.</P>
    <P>All of the grants listed in the above table were or will be fully used by Clare County Council for non-national road works.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 has set out a range of policies and measures designed to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997.</P>
      <P>The first progress report of the high level group on road safety was published in July 1999 and details progress with implementing the strategy. Copies of that report have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The report notes good progress towards the primary strategy target in the first year: 3% less people died on the roads in 1998 than in 1997; 12% less people were seriously injured in 1998 than in 1997: this represents the lowest number of serious injuries for this decade and constitutes significant progress towards the five year target of at least 20% reduction. More recent provisional data from An Garda Síochána indicate that there were 377 road deaths in the first 11 months of 1999 compared with 413 in the same period in 1998.</P>
      <P>Progress towards the supporting targets of the strategy has also been made: car and truck speeds were slightly down; there were less fatal accidents in the night-time hours, commonly drink related; engineering measures to reduce accidents were implemented at 93 national road locations in 1998.</P>
      <P>The report also describes progress on key strategy actions scheduled for 1998 and 1999: the use of automatic speed detection systems has been extended and preparations were well advanced for the commissioning of fixed speed cameras; evidential breath testing for drink driving, scheduled to commence in October 1999, is now operational in four Garda stations and is being progressively extended nationwide; on-the-spot fines have been extended to non-wearing of seat belts and a range of other road safety related offences; and the scheme of a new Road Traffic Bill is being drafted in my Department to provide for a penalty points system. This will be brought before Government at the earliest possible date with a view to publication of the Bill by mid-2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254, 255 and 257 together.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1999 provide for a standard external identification for hackneys, removal of the restrictions on the use of radios and telephonic equipment in relation to hires by hackneys, and the introduction of an agreed fare log for hackneys driving into, through or out of a taximeter area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations were the subject of prolonged consultation between my Department and interested parties, including hackney representa<Col N="754" /> tives. They do not provide for any change in the licensing status of hackneys. Their provisions will not come into force until 1 March 2000 to allow licensing authorities and service providers sufficient time within which to adjust to the new requirements. As indicated in reply to Question No. 273 of 19 October 1999, it is primarily in view of their more limited service role that hackneys have not been allowed access to bus lanes and there are no proposals to change this position at this time.</P>
    <P>The hackney sign specification has been introduced principally to assist Garda enforcement. The introduction of the fare log is also intended to provide a means of checking that the hire is appropriate to the service in respect of which the licence was granted. The fare log will consist of a simple document, to be held by the hackney driver, which will show basic information relating to the hire for inspection by the hirer and a member of the Garda on request. As regards driver licence details, the regulations require these to be carried in the hackney vehicle, but not displayed; and to be made available on request to a hackney user or member of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Since the regulations were published, one of the groups representing hackney service providers has sought a change in some of these provisions. This request is at present under consideration in light of the deadline for commencing the new regulations.</P>

      <P>Those liable to pay PRSI are employees who earn £30 or more per week and self-employed people with an annual income of £2,500 or over.</P>
      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to a self-employed person. In general, payment of PRSI by a self-employed contributor is made through the Revenue Commissioners. However, where a self-employed person is deemed to have no net tax liability, PRSI is not collected by Revenue. Such a case is notified to my Department by the Revenue Commissioners to determine if the self-employed person has a PRSI liability. Where a PRSI liability exists special arrangements are put in place under which PRSI is paid directly to my Department.</P>
      <P>Not all cases classified as having no net tax liability by Revenue will have a PRSI liability. Examples of such cases with no PRSI liability include self-employed people with: (a) an annual income of less than £2500; (b) a pension under the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development farm retirement scheme; or (c) an unemployment assistance or pre-retirement allowance payment from my Department.</P>
      <P>In cases where a person is no longer covered by compulsory PRSI and is under 66 years of age, it is always open to them to become a voluntary contributor, provided they: (a) have at least 156 weeks PRSI paid under compulsory insurance in either employment or self employment; and (b) apply within 12 months after the end of the contribution year during which compulsory insurance was last paid as an employed or self employed contributor or during which a credited contribution was last awarded.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for retrospective payment of contributions to achieve entitlement to a contributory pension and I have no plans to change these existing arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that there have been considerable improvements to the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions over the last decade with a view <Col N="761" /> to broadening contributory pensions coverage. In addition, a non-contributory pension is available to any person who fails to qualify for a contributory pension due to insufficient contributions, in the same way as it is available to every other citizen, resident in the State and subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>Following on the extension of class A PRSI to community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; workers in 1996, the position is that CE workers are treated in the same way as other class A workers in so far as social insurance entitlements are concerned.</P>
      <P>CE workers who revert to the live register after completing a period on a CE scheme may, therefore, by virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions, qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance. As a consequence, they are not entitled to the social welfare secondary benefits which are payable only with long-term welfare payments.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit. Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for CE workers who qualify for unemployment benefit without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.

      <P>The person concerned made a late claim for widow's contributory pension on 21 October 1969. She was awarded pension from 22 July 1969, which was three months prior to the date of claim.</P>
      <P>While her late husband died in 1952, the person concerned had no entitlement to widow's contributory pension at that time. To qualify for a such a pension in 1952, it was necessary that qualifying contributions had been paid or credited in the three or five years prior to death. This condition was not satisfied in her case.</P>
      <P>With effect from 4 November 1966 the qualifying conditions for receipt of widow's contributory pension were modified to allow for payment of pension on the basis of contributions paid over the lifetime record of an insured person. This modification was introduced in section 12 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1966.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was awarded widow's contributory pension under these revised qualifying conditions when she applied for pension in October 1969.</P>
      <P>In relation to the suggestion that the person concerned was misinformed in this respect at the time of her husband's death there is no evidence of this and, in any event, she could not have qualified until 4 November 1966, when the legislation changing the conditions came into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> Under the legislation applicable at the time of her claim, the person concerned was paid three month arrears. She has since benefited from the changes announced by me in December 1998 which provided for the payment of further arrears on a proportionate basis in such cases. Under these arrangements, she received a further 82 weeks arrears of pension amounting to £246.61. Full backdating for the remaining 60 weeks to 4 November 1966, which is the earliest date from which she could qualify, can only be considered in the light of proven incapacity on the part of the person concerned to apply for pension on time, <i>force majeure</i>, departmental error, or to alleviate current financial hardship.</P>
    <P>The position will be reviewed if further relevant information is supplied by or on behalf of the person concerned.</P>

      <P>I advised the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 140 and 141 of 18 Samhain 1999 that my Department's compensation scheme was being considered by the EU Commission, and that remains the position. The scheme as submitted to the Commission covers compensation for farmers and other land-owners in SACs, SPAs and commonages, and sets out the principles and procedures to be followed in providing for compensation, rather than specifying levels of compensation. My officials are clarifying <Col N="764" /> aspects of the scheme for Commission officials in response to their queries.</P>
      <P>In the case of compensation for losses arising from the 30% reduction of sheep numbers on commonages, the rates of payment have been set following consultations between my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Teagasc. The standard payment is £38 per head of stock reduced, and incorporates the value of both ewe premium and headage payments. This figure will be reduced by £25 per head of stock to which a ewe premium payment would not have applied, and by £11 per head of stock to which a headage payment would not have applied.</P>
      <P>Because farmers have already experienced losses of income this year and because any further delay in payment would cause additional hardship, I have authorised these particular payments now and every effort is being made to ensure that they issue before Christmas.</P>

      <P>My Department currently has 12 proposals to build new pools, including one in Loughrea. All proposals are being examined giving consideration to such matters as: the need for a swimming pool in an area; suitability of the proposed site; future viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues; construction and operating standards of existing facilities; satisfactory financial plan; and the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds.</P>
      <P>However, it should be noted that funding for new pools in 1999 and 2000 is already committed to pools in Navan, Ennis and Wicklow where work is currently under way and to a pool in Dundalk which is at an advanced stage of planning.</P>

      <P>The provision of psychological services in the school referred to by the Deputy was the responsibility of the South Eastern Health Board and my Department has no knowledge of the reasons for withdrawal of that service.</P>
      <P>The management of the National Educational Psychological Service Agency &ndash; NEPS &ndash; is addressing as a matter of urgency the need for a phased transfer to NEPS of the services currently provided to schools by the health boards. This matter will be discussed at the next meeting of the management committee of NEPS, which includes representatives of the Department of Health and Children and of the health boards.</P>
      <P>The management of NEPS is compiling a record of priorities for each county for development of the service, as additional psychologists are appointed. The expansion of the service is proceeding rapidly. The Civil Service Commission has completed interviews for an additional 25 psychologists and has also completed the short-listing for a further 25. It is expected that the successful applicants from the first competition will begin to take up their positions early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology consists in physical resources of ten acres of land spread over seven major sites, all of which are covered by buildings. These buildings together with premises which the Dublin Institute of Technology is currently renting are required for the delivery of the full range of courses on offer from the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>A site of 65 acres at St. Brendan's Psychiatric Unit, Grangegorman is no longer required by the Eastern Health Board and would meet the requirements of the Dublin Institute of Technology for additional space. This space would address the concerns of the Dublin Institute of Technology in respect of student accommodation, sports fields and other amenities. This matter is under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the officers of the Union of Students in Ireland &ndash; USI &ndash; on 24 November 1999 and discussed a range of issues including purpose built student accommodation. In this regard, I explained how an across-the-board major increase in student grants was not an appropriate response to the accommodation difficulties being <Col N="772" /> encountered by students and that the core issue is a need to increase the availability of dedicated student housing and the resultant release of pressure from the rented sector. While the State does not directly provide student accommodation, provision has been made in section 50 of the Finance Act to provide a scheme of tax relief for rented residential accommodation for third level students. I understand that a number of developers have made initial inquiries or submitted applications to educational institutions in respect of developments which are within 8km of the eligible institutions and to date four such applications have received approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate, of course, that costs associated with the purchase of school books can place a financial burden on parents. To alleviate such burdens, my Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in primary and post-primary schools. For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, singe parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.</P>
      <P>A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents.</P>
      <P>The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special grants are provided to schools at second level, which are categorised as disadvantaged, to assist them in the establishment of book loan/rental schemes. At primary level, schools <Col N="773" /> that opt for book rental schemes are allocated enhanced grants to encourage schools to participate in such schemes.</P>
    <P>In 1999, £4.463 million has been allocated at second level as aid towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils while an amount of £2.585 million has been disbursed at primary level. I have recently announced the allocation of approximately £3.7 million to primary and £2.8 million to second level schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. A circular on this matter has been issued to schools by my Department.</P>

      <P>As part of the revised primary school curriculum &ndash; 1999 &ndash; all teachers in national schools have recently been issued with a new pro<Col N="774" /> gramme in science. This is set out in the form of two booklets &ndash; a curriculum statement, incorporating the aims and content objectives for each class level, and guidelines for teachers on the teaching of the subject. The new science programme comprises four interlinked strands, namely: (1) living things; (2) energy and forces; (3) materials; and (4) environmental care.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the revised curriculum will be on a phased basis over four to five years and will be supported by a comprehensive programme of in-career professional development for teachers. It has been decided that schools will be free to introduce subject areas as they see fit, taking account of the expertise and interests of their staffs. In order to encourage schools to incorporate science in their curriculum, I have recently announced a new grants' scheme for the teaching of science in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The issue of the uptake of the physical science subjects at leaving certificate level has been a matter of concern to me for some time. The underlying causes of the declining uptake of the physical sciences at leaving certificate level are complex and Ireland is by no means unique in relation to this particular problem. In fact, it affects most countries in the developed world to a greater or lesser extent.</P>
      <P>Last March I announced a wide-ranging initiative to address the issue. The major elements of this initiative are: introduction of revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry in September 2000 along with teachers' guidelines and reference handbooks; a review of the junior certificate science syllabus is being undertaken by the NCCA at present; a new physical science syllabus to replace the combined physics and chemistry syllabus, is being prepared by the NCCA at present; the format of examination papers, specifically the structure and layout of questions at junior certificate ordinary level and in leaving certificate physics and chemistry, is being revised at present; a comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry at both leaving certificate and junior certificate levels; increased provision for pre-service training for teachers of physics and chemistry; a significant refurbishment programme for school laboratories, and a special <i>per capita </i>grant of £10 for pupils taking leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry</P>
      <P>I am confident that this initiative which is currently being implemented will make a significant contribution to addressing the issue. Funding for this programme is estimated to cost about £15 million.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied at the level of participation in science at junior certificate and in biology at leaving certificate.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the school in question has applied to my Department for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
      <P>While the current disadvantaged areas scheme provides important support to many disadvantaged pupils, it is based purely on pupil numbers and does not take account of different levels of need. In its review of educational disadvantage in Ireland, the educational research centre recommended that resources be better targeted. One of my concerns with the present support system is that it lacks the necessary flexibility to target individual pupils or small pockets of disadvantage within the school system.</P>
      <P>My objective is to develop a more flexible response system which will continue to support schools with large concentrations of disadvantaged pupils but will also be responsive to the needs of individual or small groups of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be bringing forward a range of measures to complement existing support services to combat educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school referred to will be fully considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group which I set up last year to examine the rights, roles, duties and responsibilities of principals in primary schools was recently presented to me.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, already a range of supports in place to assist principals in carrying out their functions. The middle management structures in schools which have been developed in recent years enable the principal to delegate a number of functions to other teachers. In particular, many schools have access to secretarial and caretaking services, and I have recently announced substantial improvements in the level of assistance in these areas.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year. The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools and principals.</P>
      <P>There are various recommendations which impact on the terms and conditions of teachers which should, as envisaged in the report be pursued through the relevant industrial relations machinery, particularly as cross-sectoral impacts must be considered.</P>

      <P>In April of this year, a training bonus of £25 per week was introduced for FÁS participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, that is at least 12 months unemployed. This allowance was later approved for eligible VTOS participants, including lone parents and those on disability allowance who have been in receipt of their respective payment for at least 12 months also on the same basis.</P>
      <P>The bonus was introduced as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes. Periods spent on community employment or job initiative schemes may be combined with periods of unemployment for the purpose of meeting the qualifying criteria for the bonus.</P>
      <P>The effect of the incentive in prioritising access for the long-term unemployed would be dissipated if the bonus were applied equally to all participants.</P>

      <P>The central point is a feature of the post-primary school transport scheme, and is in operation in several towns where there is more than one post-primary school. In towns where the central point feature is operated, post-primary pupils are dropped and collected at the central point and are expected to make their way to their respective schools.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1995, pupils attending the schools in question were dropped outside the Loreto Convent each morning and afternoon. In 1995, it was decided to extend the services in the morning to the schools, as the pupils had to make their way up a very steep hill to get to the schools. Buses continue to collect pupils at the central point in the afternoons. This is a distance of 0.7 miles and 0.8 miles from the schools concerned taking the shortest traversable route.</P>
      <P>To apply the terms of the school transport scheme in a fair and consistent manner, it is not open to my Department to extend school services to the schools concerned in the afternoon. To extend services in such circumstances, where extra cost is involved, would set a precedent, which would be unsustainable by my Department in its operation of a national scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grant.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers I have recently <Col N="784" /> announced that an additional £2.7 million has been made available to extend support to another 650 schools with a total enrolment of 90,000 children in the coming year. The Deputy will also be aware that I have secured an additional £9 million in the recent budget which will enable me to extend and improve the supports available to all primary schools. Details of the implementation of this will be worked out in the near future following consultations and will, when taken together with the earlier move, make a major contribution to assisting schools.</P>

      <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible pupil will have to travel more than 1.5 miles to the pick-up point. The pupil to whom the Deputy refers resides 0.9 miles from the existing pick-up point.</P>
      <P>The service in question operated along the requested route on a temporary basis, while road repairs were under way on the normal route. To re-route the service permanently would not affect existing primary pupils, but would inconvenience post-primary pupils whose current first pick-up time is 7.50 a.m. It would also involve additional mileage.</P>
      <P>An application for special transport on medical grounds was received, but declined by my Department's medical advisor, who determined that the child's condition would not prevent him from making his own way to the pick-up point.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I regret that the present level of service is the most that can be offered by my Department.</P>

      <P>I understand that this person is seeking the £25 bonus payment payable to VTOS students who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme &ndash; at least 12 months unemployed.</P>
      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers in the question was a dependent partner up to recently and, as such, was not in receipt of an unemployment payment in her own right. She, therefore, does not fall into the 12 month criterion to be eligible for this bonus payment.</P>
