    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1, Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill, 1998 [Seanad]; No. 30, Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999 [Seanad]  &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed) and No. 32 &ndash; Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, l998 [Seanad] &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed).

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, the Government promised telecommunications regulation legislation and legislation to amend the Wireless Telegraphy Acts. In the context of that legislation, will the Minister direct mobile telephone operators to take account of recent research by Leeds University? That research shows there is no need for mobile telephone masts. Small transmitters the size of a cigarette packet have been developed in Leeds University which can provide all the facilities currently provided by a mobile telephone mast. It would obviate much difficulty in many parts of the country if this legislation required planning authorities and operators to take account of this latest research from Leeds University.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The telecommunications regulation Bill will be ready late this year. I do not have a date for the wireless telegraphy Bill, but it <Col N="1446" /> will drafted after the other telecommunications Bills that are being drafted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is causing problems in many parts of rural Ireland and is not a matter for the giddy responses given by the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach inform the House if the Government has decided whether it is necessary to introduce legislation or, alternatively, a resolution to give legal effect to the extraordinary generous pension settlements agreed between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the two former judges who recently resigned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The examination of that matter has not yet been completed. Irrespective of whether it is necessary to introduce legislation or a resolution, such legislation or resolution must come before the House and be passed by it to give it effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Government proposes to bring forward whatever mechanism is agreed upon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is under examination and it will be a while before it is brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the two people in question are not in receipt of any State money and have not received any indication from the State when the deal agreed between them and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will come into effect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question is correct. They are not in receipt of any State money. The second part of his question is incorrect as there was no deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, the Government promised legislation to reform the structures of Údarás na Gaeltachta and that elections to Údarás will take place on the same day as the elections to local authorities, 11 June. Is it still the Government's intention to proceed with both items?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that matter yesterday. That legislation is almost ready. If it is not ready in time, the election will be postponed until <Col N="1447" /> later in the year. A statement on this matter will be made shortly. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in congratulating the Garda Síochána on securing a conviction yesterday against Mr. Joe Delaney in respect of the brutal murder case? In terms of some of the issues that arise out of the case, will the Taoiseach indicate if subsequent to the enactment of the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Act, any further legislative measures are contemplated to give protection to jurors in similar cases in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spoke about this matter. I am not sure if it is covered in the last Act. The Minister said he will examine this issue. The Garda always do a good job and it did a particularly good job in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the issue of the plight of 150 traffic wardens with the Taoiseach yesterday morning. Did the Taoiseach have an opportunity to talk to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to secure an extension of time to negotiate the new terms of work that will apply to those traffic wardens when they move to Dublin Corporation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Friday is the deadline in this case. If we do not raise it again today, it will be too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I communicated Deputy Bruton's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, has the Taoiseach given thought to the publication of standards in public office Bill? I raise this matter because a Fianna Fáil Cork county councillor believes elected candidates who break their election promises and do not live up to what they promised in Government should be subject to criminal proceedings. I ask the Taoiseach to take account of his record on the issue of Partnership for Peace and calling for a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss that matter now. The Deputy asked a question on proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Taoiseach would indicate whether the date of publication of that Bill will be postponed to give him time to consider the ramifications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is being drafted. It should be ready later in the summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is promised on the UN convention for the protection of UN personnel serving abroad. Given that a UN force may go into Kosovo and that if Irish personnel serving abroad are attacked they will be protected by 23 countries, but not by Ireland, will the Taoiseach now introduce that legislation or will he accept the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A parliamentary draftsman has been assigned to that legislation, which is due later in the year, to enable Ireland to accede to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations Associated Personnel. If there is a requirement to bring it forward, I am sure that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent wants to put half our politicians behind bars. I have a different question for the Taoiseach in respect of the standards in public office Bill. I could not hear the Taoiseach's answer. Having regard to what seemed to be reported in <i>Ireland on Sunday</i>, whereby the entire massed ranks behind him are in revolt, led by the Minister for Finance, is the Taoiseach still proceeding with that Bill? Will it be discussed unofficially at Punchestown today? Does the Taoiseach think the Bill will proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is proceeding. Like all matters, it is discussed in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> In light of the recent UCD survey which showed that 80 per cent of asylum seekers to this country have some form of third level qualification, has the row between the Taoiseach's party and the Progressive Democrats in relation to work permits for asylum seekers been resolved? If so, when will we see the long promised legislation?</P>

      <P>Do I take it, therefore, that the 150 Kosovar refugees who, it is indicated in today's newspapers, will come to these shores in the next week or so, will not be allowed to work, even if they want to do so and even if there are people here who would like to employ them?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cabinet subcommittee has been working on this matter since last year. It is a very serious matter. Irish society still has to face up to many of the problems of child abuse in the past.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when we might expect ministerial orders or regulations required under the telecommunications regulations Bill to stop Esat cherrypicking and advertising for customers who pay £100 per month upwards only? The director of telecommunications regulations cannot prevent this because the Minister has not made the regulations. When might we see these regulations?</P>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and received a comprehensive reply from the Minister in the form of a copy of a reply he sent to a constituent of mine who had no contact with me.

As regards Deputy Bruton's question, I hope nothing like this is happening today. The late Donogh O'Malley closed those institutions based on the Kennedy report in 1970. As a society, however, we have not dealt with these matters. These programmes are based on facts made available by the Minister for Education and Science. I have had many discussions with him regarding their contents, about which he is greatly concerned. My colleagues and I are anxious to find a mechanism to deal with the issue properly. It is a job which remains to be done and it cannot be left undone. These people were isolated and treated in an unbelievable manner. I know times were different then, but that does not excuse child abuse. These matters have to be dealt with and I hope our recommendations will help to do so.</P>

    <Title>Radiological Protection Bill, 1998  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Col N="1453" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is comparatively short and is of a technical nature. It provides for amendments to certain sections of the Radiological Protection Acts, 1991 and 1995, specifically those sections relating to the regulatory and licensing role of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. I wish to refer to the functions of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. As Deputies will be aware, representatives of the institute recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, and this would have been informative about the institute's activities.</P>
      <P>The institute was established in April 1992 under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, and replaced the Nuclear Energy Board. The main functions of the institute are enshrined in the provisions of the 1991 Act and include providing advice to the Government and the Minister for Public Enterprise and other Government Ministers on matters relating to radiological safety; monitoring developments abroad relating to nuclear installations and radiological safety; monitoring, measuring and assessing radioactivity contamination of the environment including the seas around Ireland; controlling, by way of licence, the custody, use, manufacture, transportation, distribution, exportation and disposal of radioactive substances, irradiating apparatus and other sources of ionising radiation; informing the Irish public on any matters relating to radiological safety and supporting the development and implementation of national plans for nuclear and radiological emergencies.</P>
      <P>The institute is responsible for licensing all activities in the State involving ionising radiation. This includes hospitals, dental practices, veterinary surgeons, laboratory instruments, industrial operations, distribution of irradiating equipment, industrial radiography and research laboratories. There are over 1,000 licensees at present. Many of these licensed activities are carried on efficiently, but if not operated to high standards of radiological protection they are potentially hazardous to workers, patients under medical and dental care, and members of the public. The institute has a key role as regulator in ensuring that acceptable standards of practice are maintained.</P>
      <P>The amendments proposed in the Bill concern the regulatory activities of the institute currently enshrined in the Radiological Protection Act, 1991. In essence, the Bill makes provision for the strengthening of the licensing powers of the institute relating to the use of X-ray equipment by practitioners and the elaboration of powers to fix licence fees. It also creates new offences to enhance the institute's regulatory role drawing upon the institute's experience since the 1991 Act was enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> Section 2 provides for amendments to section 30 of the 1991 Act. Section 30 of the 1991 Act is the main legislative basis for the institute's regulatory functions and essentially provides for the institute to regulate, by licence, the custody, control and use of radioactive substances, nuclear devices or irradiating apparatus. The first main provision in Section 2 of the Bill relates to the institute's power to licence persons for the use of X-ray equipment. Under section 30 of the 1991 Act, the institute is empowered to licence persons for the custody and use of X-ray equipment. However, neither the 1991 Act nor the 1993 order made under it empowers the institute to satisfy itself as to the competence of the licensee to use such equipment. In fact, section 7(2) of the 1991 Act, which was amended by section 26 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, restricts the institute's role to the supervision and care of the X-ray equipment and to ensuring that the equipment is properly calibrated and maintained. The institute has, in its more recent annual reports, highlighted this narrow focus as a potential cause of concern, particularly in relation to the regulation of chiropractors.</P>
    <P>The European Communities (Medical Ionising Radiation) Regulations of 1988, which are enforced by the Minister for Health and Children, set out the requirements relating to the competency of persons engaged in the use of X-ray equipment for medical and dental purposes. In summary, articles 5 and 6 of the 1988 regulations provide that a person cannot carry out a medical or dental treatment involving ionising radiation unless he or she is a doctor or other practitioner or a dentist deemed by the Medical Council or the Dental Council, as the case may be, to have the required competence in terms of radiation protection and radiation techniques. However, chiropractors, unlike doctors or dentists, are not recognised by the Medical Council. At present, an anomalous legislative situation exists whereby the institute can licence a chiropractor for the custody and use of X-ray equipment despite the fact that under the separate 1988 regulations mentioned above, the chiropractor is not entitled to use the equipment as he or she is not recognised by the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>Section 2(b) of the Bill will rectify this anomaly. It will amend the 1991 Act to provide that the institute cannot grant a licence for the use of X-ray apparatus, unless the institute is satisfied that the person meets the requirements of articles 5 and 6 of the 1988 regulations. The amendment will also empower the institute to revoke an existing licence where the licensee does not meet the same requirements. It will be the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the users of such substances, devices or apparatus for these purposes meet the requirements of the 1988 regulations.</P>
    <P>The second main amendment in section 2 of the Bill relates to the prescription of licence fees. All of these fee fixing changes will be important to the new regulatory powers of the institute <Col N="1455" /> under a EURATOM directive which I will refer to later. The proposed amendment in sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Bill will elaborate on the existing fee fixing powers relating to licences issued by the institute. It is designed to confer maximum flexibility on the Minister so that the institute's licensing administration costs will be recovered in a fair and equitable manner. For example, the institute will be empowered to retain fees or a proportion of fees paid to it in respect of the licensing process in circumstances where the licence applicant does not ultimately qualify for a licence.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 40(1) of the 1991 Act by the addition of a provision which will make it an offence for a person knowingly or recklessly to make a false statement when applying for a licence under section 30 of that Act. It also makes it an offence for a person not to comply with a condition of a licence pursuant to section 30.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 41 of the 1991 Act as amended by section 65 of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998. The amendments are merely technical amendments to clarify the summary prosecution powers of those relevant Ministers, the institute and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland identified in section 41 of the 1991 Act, as amended, in respect of offences created under section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 96/29 of EURATOM which was adopted on 13 May 1996, lays down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against dangers arising from ionising radiation. This directive replaces a previous basic safety standards directive and applies to all practices involving ionising radiation sources. As far as Ireland is concerned, the directive would apply, for example, to hospitals, dental practices, veterinary practices and universities where radiation is used. It will also apply to any industrial activities where radioactive sources would be involved. The directive, unlike previous directives, will cover work activities involving workplace exposure to natural radiation such as radon and cosmic radiation in the case or air crew. The directive lays down a number of obligations for which member states must legislate. These include: the identification of work activities; the introduction of radiation protection measures to monitor, control or reduce exposures to natural sources of radiation; the introduction of radiation protection principles for intervention in cases of radiological emergencies or lasting exposures and; the need to have emergency planning to cover radiological emergencies and accidents. A number of the requirements of the directive are already provided in existing national legislation.</P>
    <P>This is an important directive which will profoundly influence radiological protection in member states for a considerable time. It represents a significant step forward in radiation protection. Member states are required to transpose the <Col N="1456" /> directive into national legislation not later than 13 May 2000. To meet this deadline my Department has, in the past week, finalised a consultation paper which incorporates a draft order setting out how my Department, in consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, intends to implement the directive. The objective of the consultation paper, which is available to all interested parties, will be to draw upon a wide spectrum of opinion and expertise within the country before finalising the implementing of legislative proposals. For the information of Deputies, copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Dáil Library. It is my intention that the directive will be enshrined in Irish law by an order made under section 30 of the 1991 Act.</P>
    <P>Sellafield has been a source of grave concern to successive Governments and to the Irish. The main factors driving the Government's opposition to Sellafield operations is the risk, however remote, of a catastrophic accident, the continued operation of the magnox reactors beyond their design life, the continued reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, the complexity of operations of the Sellafield site, the storage of high level radioactive waste in liquid form on site and the impact of radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Since assuming responsibility for nuclear safety and radiological protection, I have been in frequent contact with the relevant UK Ministers about Sellafield matters. In November 1997, I had my first formal meeting in Dublin with Mr. Michael Meacher, the UK Minister for the Environment, at which I raised the whole range of nuclear safety issues of concern to Ireland. Since then I have been in contact with Mr. Meacher on a number of occasions. I had a further meeting with him in London in February of this year. At the meeting in February I focused on our concerns about the UK Environment Agency's proposed decisions, announced last October, for a variation in BNFL's current radioactive discharges authorisation limit in respect of the Sellafield plant and for the approval of the MOX fuel fabrication plant at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I met Mr. Meacher because the Environment Agency had referred the proposed decisions to UK Ministers for consideration. At the meeting I followed up on previous written submissions on both matters. As to the Sellafield discharge authorisations, my Department's previous views had set out Ireland's concerns about radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea &ndash; particularly discharges of the long life radionuclide technetium-99 which have grown significantly since 1994 &ndash; and called for the cessation of such discharges. Similarly, my Department's written submissions to the UK Environment Agency had set out our concerns and opposition to the proposed MOX plant.</P>
    <P>I had been surprised and disappointed at the UK Environment Agency's draft discharge authorisations, especially given the positive commitments regarding radioactive discharges to the marine environment which emerged from the <Col N="1457" /> OSPAR ministerial meeting the previous July in Portugal. At that meeting, a strategy on radioactive discharges was adopted which committed all OSPAR Ministers, including the UK Ministers, to the virtual elimination of such discharges into the sea by the year 2020. In addition, UK Ministers at the same meeting promised to take account of concerns raised by Ireland and other countries about technetium-99 discharges into the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The agency's proposed decision, while it involved a reduction in the permitted levels of technetium-99 discharges, is totally unacceptable to the Irish Government as the proposed technetium reductions are completely inadequate. I regard the proposed decision as, effectively, a breach of the undertaking entered into by the UK Ministers at the OSPAR ministerial meeting. I reminded Mr. Meacher of the need to honour these commitments speedily. Mr. Meacher informed me that he was fully aware of the strong concerns in Ireland and in the Scandinavian countries about technetium-99 discharge levels and that he would reflect fully on the matter before a final decision was made.</P>
    <P>In the course of my discussion with Mr. Meacher, there was a reference to the meeting of the OSPAR radioactive substances group held in Dublin in January. On the agenda of that meeting was the strategy on radioactive substances adopted last July by the OSPAR Ministers.</P>
    <P>When I officially opened the Dublin meeting I emphasised the necessity of meeting the objectives of the strategy within the timeframe laid down and in a way which addresses legitimate concerns about the impact of such discharges on sea-based livelihoods and the enjoyment of the amenities of the Irish Sea. The upshot of the Dublin meeting was that the relevant contracting parties are to submit reports to the OSPAR secretariat by mid-September next, setting out how they intend to meet the objectives of the strategy and their timeframe. These reports will then be examined and discussed by a small group made up of a number of contracting parties with a view to submitting proposals to the next meeting of the OSPAR radioactive substances group in January 2000. Ireland is participating in this small select group and will use this opportunity to ensure that the proposals put forward by the contracting parties will be aimed at achieving the strategy objectives. A key OSPAR milestone will be the meeting of the Commission in mid-2000 when the implementation strategy will be discussed. I hope that early reductions in Sellafield discharges will form part of those discussions.</P>
    <P>I also drew Mr. Meacher's attention to the Irish Government's total opposition to the UK Environment Agency's draft decision to give the go-ahead to the MOX plant. I requested that Ireland's concerns about this project, set out in two earlier separate submissions to the Environment Agency, should be given careful consideration by UK Ministers. Mr. Meacher assured me that Ireland's views would be borne in mind in the decision making process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> I have also been in contact with the UK Minister of State for Science and Technology, Mr. John Battle, specifically concerning the high level liquid waste storage arrangements at Sellafield. We are concerned about the storage of such waste in liquid form and I am anxious to see an acceleration by BNFL of its waste vitrification process, whereby this waste would be converted to glass. I want ot see the backlog of waste being vitrified much earlier than the target date of 2015 set by BNFL.</P>
    <P>Mr. Battle has assured me of the safety aspects of the existing waste storage arrangements and of the UK's intention to vitrify the waste as soon as practicable. Vitrification is the optimum approach to such waste. However, I consider the target date of 2015 to clear the waste backlog to be too far in the future.</P>
    <P>I have asked Mr. Battle to urge BNFL to release to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland relevant technical information on the waste storage arrangements to enable the institute to form its own judgment as to the risks involved. The institute will meet BNFL at Sellafield this week to discuss the matter further. Irrespective of the outcome of such contacts, I remain adamant that the vitrification process should be accelerated. I will return to the matter again when Mr. Battle meets me in Dublin on 21 May.</P>
    <P>In addition to my direct contact with my UK ministerial counterparts, there is ongoing contact between officials of my Department and the institute and their UK counterparts and also formal contact through the Ireland-UK contact group. This group comprises officials of my Department and the institute and officials of relevant UK Departments and meets twice a year to discuss radioactivity and nuclear matters. Meetings of the group provide further opportunities for pursuing Ireland's concerns about Sellafield and related matters.</P>
    <P>Ireland's concerns about Sellafield and the UK nuclear industry are raised at every opportunity in EU and international fora, including meetings of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD and meetings held under the umbrella of the Oslo-Paris Convention on marine pollution.</P>
    <P>Apart from the more recent positive development which emerged from the OSPAR ministerial meeting last July in regard to radioactive discharges, there have been other positive developments on the international front on nuclear safety generally. The convention on nuclear safety, which came into force in 1996, is aimed at ensuring land-based civil nuclear installations are safe and well regulated and at promoting a high level of nuclear safety worldwide.</P>
    <P>The convention provides for a peer review process which enables contracting parties to assess country reports on how contracting parties are complying with the convention. In the view of the Irish delegation, the first peer review meeting, which was held within the past two weeks at the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy <Col N="1459" /> Agency in Vienna, proved successful and was conducted in a good atmosphere. It appeared that many countries had responded to the built-in encouragement of the exchange of information and the self-assessment principles of the convention and there was evidence that some had examined their regulatory framework to ensure it was in line with the convention's provisions. There was also a demonstration of greater recourse to external independent assessments of nuclear plant operators.</P>
    <P>In the words of the summary report of the proceedings, the discussions were &ldquo;open and constructive&rdquo;. There was a reasonable opportunity to discuss national reports submitted by countries party to the convention. In Ireland's case, the opportunity was taken to raise concerns on issues relating to the UK report. Not surprisingly, the issues discussed included the ageing Magnox reactors and the regulatory policies of the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>The nuclear safety convention will enhance nuclear safety worldwide and represents the type of significant international commitment needed to ensure the highest standards of safety which Ireland and other non-nuclear states have been endeavouring to establish for many years.</P>
    <P>Various research studies have concluded that radon gas may be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer in the home. In 1992, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland initiated a national survey to measure radon concentrations in domestic dwellings. This has been completed in respect of 24 counties and the results have been published. The results for the remaining two counties, Galway and Mayo, are being analysed and will be published shortly. Of the almost 12,000 houses measured to date, some 1,100 have been identified as having radon measurements in excess of the national reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre. This is a level above which the institute would recommend that radon remediation works be undertaken by the householder. When the survey is completed the institute intends producing a map showing the areas most affected by radon.</P>
    <P>The Government is making every effort to address the problem of high radon concentrations in dwellings. The Department of the Environment and Local Government published revised technical guidance documents relating to the building regulations incorporating explicit requirements for radon preventive measures in the construction of new dwellings from 1 July 1998. More elaborate radon protection measures are specified for new houses in the high radon areas identified in the institute's survey. At the request of the Minister for Education and Science, the institute has recently initiated a comprehensive nationwide radon measurement survey of schools to ensure any problems with radon are identified. The EU basic safety standards directive includes specific provisions relating to exposure to natural radiation sources and, in this <Col N="1460" /> context, the exposure of workers and members of the public to radon in the workplace is specifically addressed.</P>
    <P>The Government is firmly committed to its policy of nuclear safety and radiological protection and to its campaign against Sellafield. Last year it established the ministerial committee on nuclear safety. The committee, which I chair, comprises the Ministers of State at the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, Health and Children, and the Environment and Local Government. The office of the Attorney General, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and officials of the Departments mentioned are also on the committee. The objective of the committee, whose terms of reference are broad and encompass nuclear and radiological safety issues and the campaign against Sellafield, is to co-ordinate nuclear safety policy; complement the work of the Departments and agencies involved in developing and implementing radiological protection policy, and give added impetus to the Government's efforts in the area of nuclear safety and radiation protection. The committee has met on five occasions since its establishment.</P>
    <P>The national emergency plan for nuclear accidents is designed to provide a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure. The plan outlines the measures to assess and mitigate the effects of nuclear accidents which occur in the United Kingdom or elsewhere and which might pose a radiological hazard to Ireland. As Minister of State with responsibility for nuclear safety matters, I am responsible for the plan and for ensuring the co-ordination of the respective responsibilities and functions of relevant Departments, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and local authorities. Following a simulated nuclear emergency exercise in November 1996, in which Ireland participated, a fundamental review of the plan was undertaken by my Department and the institute in consultation with other relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>Arising from the review, a number of procedural and practical improvements were identified and these have now been approved by the Government. They include the establishment of a committee of Ministers from appropriate Departments which would give policy direction on recommended counter measures, as necessary; the reinforcement of the co-ordinating role of the existing emergency response co-ordination committee which comprises representatives from key Departments and agencies; the establishment of a consultative committee comprising senior officials of relevant Departments and agencies to exchange views on the plan, including its organisation and testing, and to make decisions on necessary actions relevant to their respective areas; an upgrading of the accommodation, communications equipment and public information ser<Col N="1461" /> vices within the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements also provide for the exploration of the possibilities for North-South co-operation in the context of an accident or emergency affecting, or potentially affecting, the island as a whole. It is my intention to organise a test of the new emergency arrangements later this year or early next year and to publish the updated plan.</P>
    <P> On the County Louth residents' legal action against British Nuclear Fuels, as the House is aware, the Government approved an offer of financial assistance of £350,000 to the residents towards the cost of research work to be undertaken by them. This offer was made despite the fact that the State is a co-defendant in the residents' action. A number of payments have been made to the residents on foot of this offer. The Government also approved in December 1997 a package of assistance relating to defined areas of work by the residents' legal team in assessing research work. This package was outlined by me to the residents that same month. However, the residents have yet to confirm that they are in a position to accept this offer.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that, despite the fact that the State remains a co-defendant in this case, the Government has, at all times, endeavoured to be as helpful and co-operative as possible to the residents. The commitment of not insignificant resources by the Government is indicative of its willingness in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government will keep under review the question of taking legal action against BNFL in respect of the risk to Ireland from Sellafield. However, litigation against Sellafield raises many complex technical and legal issues. The Government will continue to draw on the best scientific and legal advice before deciding on litigation of such a challenging nature.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to paint a picture of the Government's efforts to promote nuclear safety and radiological protection and the actions being taken by the Government to protect citizens from the environmental hazards of nuclear power activities in the UK and elsewhere. Over the past ten years or so, the tide of public opinion in Europe has moved against nuclear power. Ireland, through successive Governments, has played a consistent role in this process and, as far as this Government is concerned, will continue to play a leading role in highlighting the risks associated with the nuclear energy industry and ancillary activities. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Stagg has another important commitment this morning so with your agreement, a Cheann Comhairle, I will allow him to speak first as long as he leaves me something to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Currie for allowing me to speak first. I am sure he will have plenty to say when I am finished. I welcome the Mini<Col N="1462" /> ster's wide-ranging and interesting speech, most of which had nothing to do with the Bill. He felt required to speak for the allotted time and took the opportunity to put his wares on display, with which I have no difficulty.</P>
      <P>What we are dealing with looks like an innocent little Bill, simply putting our house in order as it were. It transposes into primary legislation an order made under European regulations in 1988 by Deputy O'Hanlon. The Minister is, however, reaching for the nuclear button &ndash;  I do not use that term as a pun &ndash; to wipe out the profession of chiropractice in Ireland because that will be the effect of this Bill. There has been a long-standing problem which I appreciate and examined in some detail in my former existence but without reaching a resolution. I was not in a position to reach a resolution because it lay with the Department of Health and Children. The problem arose from the fact that this profession is not recognised by the Department of Health and Children and is not regulated by it. That is as a direct result of the medical lobby preventing and ensuring this profession is not so recognised. The Minister has gone for a wipe-out to ensure these people cannot practise.</P>
      <P>We had the anomalous situation, which the Minister described, of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland being empowered to grant licences to these people to have radioactive material in their possession, but since the Medical Council would not give them the other licence or recognition required, they could not legally use it. They will not now be entitled to have this material or to use it which means they cannot operate.</P>
      <P>The Bill empowers the institute to withdraw licences from the chiropractor's association members to prevent them continuing in their profession. I am convinced that this has arisen, uniquely in Ireland, as a result of opposition from the medical lobby and the Medical Council. There are 54 highly qualified chiropractors in Ireland and 15 people are studying a five year course in Britain, which is recognised and organised by universities. There are 50,000 qualified and recognised chiropractors in the United States where the profession has been recognised since 1890.</P>
      <P>The Chiropractic Association of Ireland is anxious to be officially regulated. It is prepared to self-regulate, which it does at present without recognition. It is prepared to submit its educational, indemnity and professional standards to the Department of Health and Children so it can be regulated. Since 1988 the Department of Health and Children has not bothered to do this and has said there are more pressing matters to which it needs to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill is passed chiropractors cannot operate. These are professional people who will not get involved in manipulation until they have the benefit of knowing the condition of the patient. They will want to know if bones have been damaged by disease or if they have been dislocated <Col N="1463" /> and there is only one way to find out, that is, with an X-ray. Because the group is not recognised by the Medical Council, it cannot refer its patients in the ordinary way for an X-ray as does a doctor because they will not be accepted. I received correspondence to that effect, and I am sure the Minister is also aware of that.</P>
    <P>If I present myself to a chiropractor with a pain in my neck and if he attempts to manipulate my neck without the benefit of an X-ray, he could easily kill me so he cannot carry out those practices. If I have rheumatoid arthritis in my knee and he cannot establish that by means of an X-ray, he may do serious damage if he carries out those practices. Chiropractors will have to stop operating in Ireland if this Bill is passed. These people are not quacks, spinologists or bone setters. They are recognised professionally in 80 countries, including the United States and Britain where there are specialist five year courses in universities enabling them to qualify. The 15 Irish people studying at various stages of the five year course in Britain will not be able to work in Ireland when they qualify if this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>When the Bill passes Second Stage, which I will not oppose, will the Minster go to the Department of Health and Children with the clear offer from the Chiropractic Association of Ireland that it wishes to be regulated by it? It will present the Department with the required criteria to do so and then only people within the grading set up will be entitled to put up a brass plate for this profession. It would also prevent people who do not have the qualification putting up brass plates because it would be illegal for them to so do. The Bill merely tackles this issue with the nuclear button option. People have a right to choose the form of medical treatment they want. I am sure the Minister would agree with that. It would be wrong of us to implement a Bill which would wipe out a choice of treatment which is well recognised; we are not talking about quacks here.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to radon gas in his speech although it does not relate directly to this Bill. The dangers of radon gas are now well understood and the scale of those dangers has been established. Slightly less than 10 per cent of the houses tested have been found to be over the safe limit. The previous Government introduced a scheme of grants for remedial works in houses. The current Minister of State promised to pursue that but he did not refer to it in his speech today. I urge him to put it back on his agenda now that he has results for all counties, with the exception of Mayo and Galway, in order to assist people to eliminate radon gas from their houses.</P>
    <P>As Members will be aware, between 200 and 300 people die annually as a direct result of radon gas levels in their homes. That is a frightening figure but it is something we could easily remedy. The amount of money it costs to run a hospital for a few days would be sufficient to eliminate the danger of radon gas and prevent some people dying from lung cancer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> I thank Deputy Currie for allowing me to speak and I urge the Minister to consider finishing Second Stage of the Bill and to then ask the Department of Health and Children to put its house in order to allow chiropractors to continue operating in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and Deputy Stagg for their co-operation in taking the Bill this morning. I welcome the Bill which makes provision for the strengthening of the licensing powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in relation to the use of X-ray equipment by practitioners, the elaboration of powers to fix licence fees and the creation of new offences to enhance the institution's regulatory role.</P>
      <P>Under section 30 of the 1991 Act, the institute is empowered to licence persons for the custody and use of X-ray equipment. However, as the Minister has pointed out, the institute was not given the power to satisfy itself as to the competence of the licensee to use such equipment. This was clearly inadequate and section 2(b) of this Bill seeks to remedy that by providing that the institute cannot grant a licence for the use of X-ray apparatus unless it is satisfied that the applicant satisfies competency requirements. This makes sense as far as it goes.</P>
      <P>The Minister has informed us, as he informed Members of the Seanad, that the Bill is comparatively short and of a technical nature. That does not mean it is unimportant. It is important to those of us who have been and will be exposed to X-ray equipment and its operators in the medical and dental professions and to other practitioners. However, the Bill is also important to a group to which the Minister referred briefly and about which Deputy Stagg has spoken, namely, chiropractors. Before this matter was drawn to my attention I knew very little about chiropractics. I note the issue did not arise in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Chiropractics began as a separate profession in the United States in the 1890s and there are now more than 50,000 chiropractors in the US alone. The profession is recognised in approximately 80 countries. More than 80 per cent of the patients who attend chiropractors suffer from back or neck pain, headache or pain to shoulders, arms or legs. Management includes manual treatments, physical therapy modalities, exercise programmes, patient education and lifestyle modification. Emphasis is placed on joint manipulation; this is referred to as joint adjustment. Emphasis is also placed on health promotion and an early return to activities for injured patients. Chiropractors do not use drugs or surgery and refer people for medical care when such interventions are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 15 chiropractic colleges in the United States, one in Canada, two in South Africa, two in Australia, two in the UK and one each in France and Denmark. Courses vary in length from four and a half to five years for undergraduate training. The European Chiropractors' Union requires all graduates to complete one <Col N="1465" /> year's clinic training before going into practice independently. We are not talking about a group of quacks or people who can be easily dismissed.</P>
    <P>The Chiropractic Association of Ireland &ndash; CAI &ndash; was established in 1985 by a small group of qualified chiropractors. It is the only association representing chiropractors in Ireland today; there are no competing organisations as in so many other professions. The CAI is affiliated to the ECU and the World Federation of Chiropractors. It ensures that all its members have attained a minimum education to satisfy European Council for Chiropractic Education criteria for membership. It also ensures all members are indemnified for malpractice and adhere to practice guidelines and a code of ethics.</P>
    <P>The CAI has a disciplinary committee and an X-ray standards committee and ensures that its members adhere to ongoing ECU education requirements. The CAI represents the majority of chiropractors in Ireland with 54 members, each of whom has an average of 2,000 patients. Thirteen Irish students are currently at various stages of the five year training programme in the UK. Approximately ten people in Ireland who use the title of chiropractor have no qualification. We must take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>If this legislation goes through the House unamended, it could lead to the closing down of chiropractic clinics throughout Ireland. It is important to note that the Bill provides for the revocation of existing licences. If this legislation is passed and the RPII chooses to implement it to the letter, it will have the effect of removing all direct access by chiropractors to X-ray facilities, thereby reducing their ability to diagnose and treat their patients and, ultimately, threatening their livelihood.</P>
    <P>This is not just a simple little Bill. Before passing it, we must be absolutely certain on what our determination is based and who will gain from it. I agree that the Departments of Public Enterprise and Health and Children and the RPII should work towards the implementation of minimum qualification standards for practitioners who use X-ray equipment. It would be irresponsible to do otherwise. There is an onus on the Minister &ndash; I recognise the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children in the matter &ndash; to provide a full explanation of what is being proposed and why. Why, for example, can we not allow the RPII to issue licences for X-ray equipment to those practitioners who meet certain minimum standards of training and who subject themselves to an agreed inspection regime? This is what the RPII would like. I hope that between now and Committee Stage the Minister will give careful consideration to this point in consultation with the Department of Health and Children, the RPII and the Chiropractic Association of Ireland. As in all matters, it is better if we can proceed with agreement.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, of which I and Deputy Stagg are members, can be given an additional function in <Col N="1466" /> this context. Why not create an opportunity for both sides of the argument to put their positions before the committee? I will be urging the committee to take such a course of action and will suggest to it that it discuss the matter and its implications. I hope in doing so I will have the support of other members of the committee, one of whom is currently in the House on the Government benches.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised a number of other matters which do not directly pertain to this Bill but which are nevertheless important. I pay tribute to the RPII. Through the work of the committee to which I referred I had an opportunity two weeks ago of making an assessment of the institute and was impressed by what I heard.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to radon gas, an issue discussed by the committee two weeks ago. It is estimated that between 60 and 70 per cent of the annual average exposure to radiation comes from radon through the air we breathe. This is a startling statistic. Exposure to high levels of radon over a long period can lead to an increased risk of contracting lung cancer. According to the RPII, and applying risk factors to the average indoor radon concentration in Ireland, approximately 10 per cent of lung cancer deaths annually may be due to radon exposure. Are we doing enough to remedy the danger of radon in homes, schools, the workplace and on farms in view of that frightening statistic? I do not think we are.</P>
    <P>The Minister took the opportunity to make comments about Sellafield. As far as I have noted, the Minister is not a very emotional person in public life and is not prone to histrionics or startling statements. He comes across as somebody who would look at things in a sensible and moderate manner. It is in this context that I quote the following excerpt from his speech:</P>
    <P>The agency's proposed decision, while it involves a reduction in the permitted levels of Technetium-99 discharges, is totally unacceptable to the Irish Government as the proposed Technetium reductions are completely inadequate. Indeed, I regard the proposed decision as effectively a breach of the undertaking entered into by the UK Ministers at the OSPAR ministerial meeting.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister said this and it shows his dissatisfaction. It also indicates the strained relationship between the Government and that of the UK &ndash; I do not think I am exaggerating the situation in saying this. Close co-operation with our neighbouring island and its Government is necessary, but not in the context of life and death matters when we are being endangered as a result of action or lack of action on their part. Therefore, the Minister should not be worried about a strained relationship but should keep on pressing the issue in the interest of all the people of the island. The British should recognise that the Minister has complete unity behind him in doing so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> The Minister also referred to other matters not directly related to the legislation and said some important things in this context. Given my background, I have particular interest in cross-Border co-operation. In the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement and the legislation which was passed by the House in relation to cross-Border bodies, we have a unique and historic opportunity to increase North-South co-operation to mutual advantage. Such an opportunity exists in the context of what we are discussing. We can co-operate in relation to Sellafield. Pressure from the Government and political parties in relation to Sellafield is good, but pressure in co-operation with the elected public representatives in Northern Ireland would be even better as it would add to the pressure we could exert on the British Government. A power-sharing government in Northern Ireland &ndash; I retain my optimism regarding its establishment although on occasion things do not look so bright &ndash; could combine with the Irish Government to put pressure on the British Government.</P>
    <P>There is as much fear in relation to Sellafield in Counties Down and Antrim as in Counties Dublin, Wicklow, Louth etc. and there is a tremendous opportunity to co-operate to mutual advantage. Even in the short-term before a Government is formed, and given the likely hiatus when the assembly will sit without powers being devolved to it, there is an opportunity for assembly members to join with Members of the Dáil in discussing this matter and exerting pressure. Given my experience North and South of the Border, I am only too willing to play any small part I can. There could be co-operation to mutual advantage through meetings between the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport and a similar committee of the Northern Ireland assembly in relation to Sellafield and similar matters. Joint action to combat exposure to radon gas is an example. There is a similar problem in the North with radon gas and I am sure the figures in Counties Fermanagh or Tyrone are no different to those in Counties Monaghan or Leitrim. This presents an opportunity for co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the national emergency plan drawn up in the aftermath of Chernobyl and which has been updated since. I welcome his assertion that this was an opportunity for North-South co-operation. It makes sense. If there is a national emergency in the South because of what happens in Sellafield or elsewhere, there will be one north of the Border. There will be similar problems and the emergency services will have to act in a similar fashion. It is of fundamental importance that there be the maximum co-operation between the authorities North and South in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is planning a major exercise to test the plan later this year or in early 2000. The Northern authorities should be brought in on that exercise to see how we can jointly cope with an emergency. It is a wonderful opportunity <Col N="1468" /> for co-operation between North and South to mutual advantage. People often point to what happened during the Second World War when Belfast was bombed on either 15 or 16 April 1942. Considerable numbers of people were killed or injured and many were left without housing. Fire brigade units came over the Border from Dundalk and Dublin and that was widely welcomed at a time when co-operation between North and South was negligible. It makes sense that there is maximum co-operation North and South in an emergency and I welcome the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable how opposition to mobile phone masts has grown in urban and rural Ireland. I attended a meeting in my constituency in Palmerstown on Monday where the first item on the agenda was the proposed erection of a mast. Only three people were against a proposal for complete opposition. This mast is to be erected in an urban area amid houses where people will have to live cheek by jowl with something they fear. Members of the Oireachtas committee of which I am a member will know we investigated the matter. We summoned people, interest groups and so-called independent experts from all sides of the argument to give evidence, and we came to the conclusion that there was not any medical evidence to substantiate the claim that these masts posed a threat to health.</P>
    <P>However, we are also realists and know that people believing there to be a threat to health is almost as serious. This is especially true when cancer is mentioned. People lower their voices and speak of the &ldquo;big C&rdquo; or use other euphemisms. It is almost an unmentionable word and strikes fear, especially where children are concerned. When people are afraid of something or if they have any niggling doubt about it, they will oppose it. People accept the committee's conclusion that there is not any medical evidence that masts pose a health threat but argue we could not prove there was not a threat and that we could not give it a clean bill of health. One argues as much as one can on that level, but it does not go down well. Therefore, these masts should not be erected close to people, schools and other centres of population.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, said on the Order of Business about recent research indicating there was not a need for these masts. We know how handy mobile phones are. All Members carry one and half of us probably do not need them nor do we need to have them constantly switched on. There is evidence that the radiation emanating from those small instruments is greater than anything emanating from masts. I notice journalists, for example, and people who constantly use mobile phones now have ear pieces for the phones so that they can be used while at the same time being held away from them thus reducing the amount of radiation they get from them. These are supposed to be sensible people but they are not prepared to take the risk. Why should ordi<Col N="1469" /> nary people living in built-up areas close to a mast be subjected to threat, even if it is considered a small one?</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Bruton is correct. I know he would not have raised the matter on the Order of Business unless he was sure of his information. I will inquire further because I would like to be able to say to my community in Palmerstown that there is no need for the proposed mast and to say to Eircell and Esat Digifone that they no longer need masts because more modern technology has overtaken their modern technology. If the information is correct, there will be a substantial sigh of relief throughout the island in urban and rural communities. I hope the information is correct and I will examine it further, as will the Minister I am sure. Perhaps he could give some information on it if he or his officials have it to hand.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill on Second Stage and will table amendments on Committee Stage. The matter concerning chiropractice is a serious weakness and some solution will have to be found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation which is a technical amendment to the Radiological Protection Act, 1991. It is important legislation with important implications for the public. I hope newspapers and broadcast media take up the issues raised by the Bill and bring them to the attention of the public. The Bill was initiated in the Seanad which means its implementation does not impose any charge on the Exchequer. That is always welcome. However, if enacted, the Bill may lead to the need to provide additional public spending on health. In that regard, I will be interested to hear the contributions of my colleague, Deputy Callely, who has a detailed knowledge of medical equipment. Those Deputies who are doctors, nurses or paramedics should also take a close look at the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals mainly with the regulation of medical X-ray equipment to minimise the dose of X-rays patients receive in hospitals and dental surgeries. It also deals with the related issue of other ionising radiation to which patients are exposed as part of diagnostic procedures or as treatment.</P>
      <P>There has been some concern at the level of X-ray exposure received by patients undergoing hospital tests. A BBC &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme broadcast in the past two or three years reported that the X-ray dose received by patients undergoing the same test in different hospitals varied by a factor of 100. Patients in some hospitals received 100 times the X-ray exposure of patients in other hospitals. It was suggested that a significant number of patients had received such intense doses of X-ray exposure that they had developed leukaemia and other radiation induced cancers. It was also suggested that the older type of X-ray imagers and poorly calibrated equipment were the principal causes of X-ray over exposure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of significant public awareness or concern about this issue in Ireland. The <Col N="1470" /> Government is, therefore, to be commended on legislating on this issue because in the past there has been far too much reaction to issues when they blow up in our face. Those responsible for this legislation in the Government  &ndash; I commend the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Jacob &ndash; the Civil Service and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are to be commended on their proactive approach to looking after our safety. It is a refreshing change from the circumstances and attitudes which led to the blood bank crisis. We can have confidence in the RPII and its staff.</P>
    <P>Like most Deputies I am a layman and have no experience of medicine except at the receiving end, where I found myself recently. When one has a sudden problem which lands one in hospital, one sees at first hand the great work done by the front line personnel in the medical profession, including the doctors, nurses and paramedical personnel, such as the X-ray department staff. It is important that we all take an interest in technical matters. An increasing proportion of legislation is of a technical nature. It is our duty to get a straightforward explanation as to what it means. We all have a public duty to scrutinise legislation and other regulatory practices and not to leave it to the experts to regulate themselves.</P>
    <P>X-rays do not evoke the same repulsion among the public as words such as &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; or &ldquo;nuclear&rdquo;. X-rays are seen as friendly because there is a folk memory which associates them with hospitals and, like the late Deputy Noel Browne, with the fight against TB. Yet, X-rays produce strong ionising radiation in the same general class as nuclear radiation. The main difference is that X-rays are of a lower energy range than the gamma rays from nuclear radiating substances. Nevertheless, they can still cause serious damage to living tissue and overdoses can initiate the same kind of sickness that nuclear radiation induces. That is why X-rays fall under the remit of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
    <P>X-rays are beneficial to us in making images which contrast metals from bones and other tissue in the body. The types of tests from which X-ray exposure is used range from simple still shots of the lungs and limbs to see evidence of fractured bones to the longer exposures involved in X-ray imaging during, for example, the barium meal test for ulcers. X-rays are also used in dental surgery investigations and are beneficial to all kinds of analyses, for scientific purposes as well as for the detection of potential crime, as may be seen at airports. They are also easy to control by comparison with nuclear radiation. Basically, they can be confined inside the metal box which will absorb the X-ray.</P>
    <P>The problem with X-ray exposures for medical or dental purposes is that the patient is exposed to something which is, in principle, dangerous. What the medical or dental practitioner must <Col N="1471" /> consider, and what underlies the practice of X-raying people, is the much greater and immediate harm to the person if he or she is not X-rayed. The other factor to be considered is that the exposure should be as short as possible and to the minimum intensity of X-rays necessary to make a useful picture. Counting X-rays along with other types of radiation exposure, such as the background nuclear radiation including that from radon gas, which is by far the biggest source of nuclear radiation in the environment, it is apparent that approximately 20 per cent of the average person's exposure to radiation comes from X-rays.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as the average person or the average house, which is why some people are exposed to dangerous levels of radon gas and why some are more exposed to X-ray exposure. Some probably receive a greater dose of X-ray exposure in hospitals than they do from all nuclear radiation in the environment over their lifetime. The Bill is an attempt to ensure this radiation exposure from medical X-rays is minimised for all patients.</P>
    <P>Technology is continually improving. X-ray detectors are becoming more sensitive and the X-ray exposure needed to make an X-ray picture is consequently becoming less strong. However, this is true only for more modern X-ray equipment. The main purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the licensing powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland relating to the use of X-ray equipment by practitioners. It brings the licensing of X-ray and other radiation sources and equipment, and its use by practitioners, within the scope of Articles 5 and 6 of the European Communities Medical Ionising Radiation Regulations, 1998 and Statutory Instrument No. 189 of that year.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains some provisions in connection with the fees associated with licensing. It should be noted that the main onus of regulation will lie with the RPII and not with the Minister or the Department. I have every confidence in the ability of the RPII to carry out this function and I hope my concerns about the avoidance of excessive doses of X-rays to patients will be noted by the Department and the RPII.</P>
    <P>It is conceivable that some older X-ray equipment will have to be replaced to comply with these new regulations. That is why I am sounding the alarm bells on the question of funding. I do not want hospital managers using up part of their normal budget for next year to comply with the provisions of this legislation and then talk about highly emotive front line ward closures at the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Once-off costs associated with replacing old high does X-ray equipment should be provided for by the health boards to the budgets of the hospitals concerned. Given that the costs should make a big difference for some hospitals and not for others, it is unreasonable for them to be met out of the normal revenue budget of the hospitals <Col N="1472" /> concerned. They should be met from funding provided for long-term capital expenditure. Given what happened in the Western Health Board area in 1998 and in two other places where there were ward closures or threatened ward closures due to bad planning of the budget, I would like the Minister for Health and Children to explicitly ring-fence a portion of the budget for the health boards to be used specifically for the replacement of non-compliant X-ray equipment and for the improvement of X-ray dose calibration procedures. I am also concerned that the fees levied under the provision of the Bill should be reasonable and not amount to a raid on the budgets of hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have similar concerns with regard to dental practices where the equipment replacement cost would be a more serious issue. The most modern dental practices now have the type of X-ray imaging which produces a single image of the entire mouth rather than the older practice of making a series of individual X-ray images on pieces of film. This approach reduces the dose to the patient by a significant amount. It should be encouraged by the RPII and the Department of Health and Children. The health boards should encourage the installation of safer X-ray equipment in its budgetary policy by ensuring that hospitals with the oldest equipment get priority funding to purchase new equipment.</P>
    <P>The license fees which are set should cover the necessary cost of licensing and should not amount to a tax on the user. Those setting license fees on public bodies should be made aware that they are service providers charging customers for a compulsory service necessary for implementing the law. The fee must be a genuine and competitive charge for the job done and not a hidden tax to feed an unnecessarily swollen bureaucracy. There are a plethora of essential regulatory agencies. I support regulation if it is in the interest of the consumer. However, licensing and regulatory agencies simply must not see themselves as powerful and unaccountable empires which can live in a cocoon of economic unreality, feeding off whatever licence fee they decide to charge their regulated customers. Licence fees to pay for administration and testing must be based on the economic cost, and the State has no right to charge a profit except to provide for test equipment replacement costs and depreciation.</P>
    <P>I also note the provisions in the Bill to chase people who do not pay their licence fees on time. Non-hospital practitioners, especially dentists, would appreciate similar promptness and similar powers to extract their payments from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Some dentists in my constituency wait months for payment of PRSI related claims from the Letterkenny offices, without the benefit of the clout of punitive legal sanctions. What would happen if they took the approach of the proposed subsection (7A) of the Principal Act and refused to carry out extractions until they had extracted the money from the Department first? I sincerely <Col N="1473" /> hope that this will never happen. Certainly the insured workers in my constituency greatly appreciate the way dentists give treatment first and ask about payment later. That is why I think they need a fair deal in terms of payments for licences and payments for treatment.</P>
    <P>To return to the safety aspects of X-rays, I would draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that section 30(2) of the Principal Act refers to the protection of workers. I am concerned about the effects on workers of chronic low level exposure to stray or escaping rays from equipment. This applies not just to medical workers, such as radiologists, but also to security personnel in the airports, who I regularly see with their hands in front of the entrance to the scanner as they push baggage through it. Is the RPII monitoring this type of exposure before damage is done?</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and strongly urge the RPII, when we give it the new powers, to actively regulate the X-ray imaging equipment and practices in our hospitals, and particularly to ensure that it is properly calibrated and gives only the minimum necessary dose. The RPII should report each year on the X-ray dose from each piece of equipment for a simple still lung or limb X-ray, for a barium meal test and, in the case of dental equipment, for a full mouth scan image so that the Department of Health and Children can plan to replace high dose equipment urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to contribute but, in passing, I heard the Minister address the emission of radon gas. It is a subject about which I have read a little and in which I am interested. It is a subject which has been inadequately addressed and I wish to avail of the opportunity to say a few words on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is an issue which is not getting the attention it deserves. It is a serious problem. Almost 10 per cent of the households surveyed in this country would appear to have a problem with radon gas. If there was a 10 per cent risk of a fire, a gas leak or an electrical fault in houses, there would be a national outcry. The risk is high. It appears that we are ignoring a serious problem . I hope we will deal with it more seriously over the next few months.</P>
      <P>The initial survey results paint a bleak picture in parts of my constituency, particularly in parts of north Cork. I admit of course that, until the survey is concluded, it will not be possible to make a national response, but the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and his Government colleagues must deal seriously with the emission of radon gas.</P>
      <P>We are told that there are solutions, that householders can take measures to deal with the problem but there is always a cost involved. I hope the Minister of State and his colleagues will be willing to introduce some type of grant to help the affected householders take remedial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is not our job to spread scare stories but there is significant evidence to suggest a link <Col N="1474" /> between radon gas and an increase in the incidence of lung cancer. Therefore, we must deal with the matter in a serious fashion.</P>
    <P>I am glad that part of the countrywide survey involves looking at our schools. While the household survey is important, it is equally important to look at schools. Obviously schools in those areas which have already produced a 10 or 12 per cent risk rate must be affected also and we must intervene at the earliest stage.</P>
    <P>Intervention, response and the provision of a solution will be costly. It is difficult to estimate the cost but it may be necessary for the Department of Public Enterprise to provide financial assistance to help affected householders respond to the problem; it is a problem which obviously will not go away. It has existed for hundreds of years. Now that we are aware of the emission of radon gas and we have a way of measuring it, we must encourage all householders to measure the rate of risk in their house and then, not only encourage but assist them to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with much wider issues than the problem of radon gas, but this is a problem which we do not often get an opportunity to discuss in this House. As the Minister mentioned it this morning I wanted to welcome his initiative in bringing it forward for debate. I hope he and his colleagues will respond. I would see the provision of some sort of financial aid to householders as imperative if we are to give people the incentive to examine the scale of the problem affecting their families' future health and then to deal with it in the prescribed manner.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Stagg, Currie, O'Flynn and Bradford for their valuable contributions. While it is a short technical Bill, it is important that we deal with the loophole about X-ray equipment, mentioned by Deputy Stagg and Deputy Currie, and the other elements of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Stagg and Deputy Currie's interpretation of the approach which they suggested would wipe out the chiropractor profession. For instance, there are currently three licences in force n respect of X-ray rquipment held by chiropractors: one is for custody in use of the equipment and the remaining two cover custody only. Therefore, I think the claims of both Deputies are exaggerated.</P>
      <P>That said, I fully respect what they had to say. They have obviously been approached by members of that profession. Indeed, the Department was only approached by them in recent days, which is surprising.</P>

      <P>However, we received a letter from the Chiropractic Association on 26 April which contained a suggestion that it should be given an opportunity to discuss its views on the Bill. I have <Col N="1475" /> already arranged for officials from my Department and the Department of Health and Children to meet representatives of the association as soon as possible to discuss their views. The issues raised by Deputies Stagg and Currie will be borne in mind during that meeting.</P>
      <P>While it would be inappropriate to comment in any detail on the association's views in advance of that meeting, the purpose of the Bill is to deal with an anomaly in the existing legislation. The legal position relating to medical competence of personnel using X-ray equipment is set out in SI 189 of 1988 Any matters of policy in this field are the primary responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children. Recognition of medical competence is the responsibility of the medical council. Regulation 5 of SI 189 of 1988 provides that X-ray apparatus shall not be used unless the person is a suitably trained doctor or other practitioner or does so under the direction and supervision of a doctor or other practitioner who in the opinion of the medical council is suitably trained in radiation protection and techniques, and has followed a course of training in radiation protection and techniques approved by the medical council.</P>
      <P>I thank the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, which provides excellent support and advice to the Government on all nuclear and radiological safety matters. The institute fulfils many duties which are vital to ensuring the safe use of radioactive materials. These include its licensing system for the custody, use and transport of radioactive substances and apparatus. It has responsibility for undertaking terrestrial and marine environmental monitoring programmes to measure radioactivity levels. It has a role in emergency planning and response and providing information to the public on matters relating to radiological protection.</P>
      <P>I appreciate very much Deputy Currie's strong interest in nuclear safety matters. I reiterate that the Government's policy, which is similar to that of previous Governments, is to pursue every possible course of action both directly with the UK Government and in the EU and international fora to eliminate the threat posed by the Sellafield complex. We continue to take a very strong line on discharges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Currie, as is his wont, referred to North-South co-operation and I always greatly admire his repeated emphasis on the need for such co-operation in all aspects of our work inside and outside the House. My Department and the RPII liaise with our Northern counterparts through the North-South contact group on radioactivity matters. There is an exchange of views on such matters as terrestrial and marine radioactivity monitoring and there is also interaction on emergency planning matters. I share the Deputy's aspiration to strengthen this level of co-operation and we will do everything possible to so do. I will examine the possibility of suitable participation by our Northern colleagues in the next test of the <Col N="1476" /> national nuclear emergency plan. Officials from Northern Ireland acted as observers during the last test of the plan.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of Deputies Currie, Stagg and Bradford with regard to radon. It would be totally irresponsible of me and all of us, not to be concerned. The RPII has repeatedly formally signalled its concerns about radon, particularly its presence in the domestic environment. It has recommended that some level of State grant-aid should be provided for remedial purposes. No such grant is in place but I have been asked in the House to keep it under review and on the agenda, and I will do so.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to non-ionising radiation emissions from masts. While it is not my specific responsibility, it comes under the remit of my senior colleague, Deputy O'Rourke. I am aware of the concern among the public from speaking to my constituents. Deputy Currie will be aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport conducted an investigation into the possible health effects of mobile telephone masts in March. It published a report subsequently, which contained certain conclusions.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the new technology referred to on the Order of Business by Deputy Currie's party leader will be realised and will ease our minds and those of the people we represent.</P>

      <P>The Bill could be more appropriately called the local authority (elimination of corruption) Bill. If the Government was serious about reforming local authorities it would have introduced a more complete Bill. This legislation is a smokescreen. It could easily have been introduced as a Bill to amend the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1997, or its provisions could have been incorporated in a genuine reforming Bill. I presume the Government was reluctant to introduce genuine local authority reforms because of the pending elections. Hard decisions would have had to be made if local government were to be reformed, as has been promised so often. Over the past year many Deputies asked when a local government reform Bill would be introduced and were told it could not happen until after the local election. We can deduce from this that the Government has reneged on its responsibility to introduce a Bill which would meaningfully reform local government. One hard decision would be whether local authority financing should be raised locally. That measure would not be popular in the run-up to an election, given the history.</P>

      <P>The dual mandate also caused problems in the Minister's party this year. Many other matters arise.</P>
      <P>Early this month we celebrated 100 years of local government and one wonders whether we would now have better services if local government still had responsibility for certain areas. Health, for instance, was once the responsibility of local authorities but was placed in the hands of health boards and we now have chaos in many areas &ndash; waiting lists, inadequate services etc. Local authorities are doing a good job and I compliment the many officials who have steered them through the years but we continue to take responsibilities from them. In the case of the National Roads Authority responsibility has been handed to a centralised organisation. It is doing its job but another tier of responsibility has been taken from local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One area where local authorities have retained responsibility is education. The vocational education committees have done a wonderful job in providing education in difficult circumstances, particularly for the disadvantaged. When no other institution or organisation was prepared to provide education the local authorities, through the vocational education committees, did so. Through adult education, many underprivileged <Col N="1478" /> people have received training under Youthreach and other programmes, again under the auspices of local government. Without this training many of these people would have been classified as drop outs and would have been maintained through life by the State, at considerable cost.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have done a good job and it is regrettable that, because of the selfishness and greed of a few individuals, all local authority members have been brought under scrutiny. We are all being blamed for the deeds of the greedy sector, many of whom are now before various tribunals of inquiry. Two such people are former local authority members and some suggest they controlled their party members on their councils. It would be a terrible indictment of democracy on local authorities if this were to continue. This Bill does nothing to eliminate the corruption which is rampant, not only by a few local authority members but by some former members of the Executive.</P>
    <P>Speaker after speaker on the Government side said it was impossible to cap expenses but if we want to act meaningfully we must do so. It will cost money to monitor it but Government speakers said it would be too expensive. If that is the case the Bill's provision to cap expenses is merely a smokescreen.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have a dual mandate in that they are also members of a local authority. They have generously given of their time and money. Before the dual mandate is abolished I hope the Minister gives serious consideration to our work as Deputies, most of which is effectively related to local authorities. We should be careful not to duplicate, eliminate or isolate.</P>
    <P>There is room for amendments to this Bill and I look forward to them, especially amendments relating to the dual mandate and the capping of expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill comes before the House at a time when the democratic system is under scrutiny. Perhaps paradoxically, local government has a better image than it has enjoyed for a long time. It certainly has a better image than do the national institutions at present. The evidence concerning public representatives and public officials which has been adduced at tribunals has caused enormous damage and Deputy Burke was right to set the Bill in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to be confident that this Bill, which is part of a large mosaic of legislation, can be effective in restoring public confidence in the short or medium term. It is also difficult to see that anything could change the appalling public image of elected representatives, public officials, and other organs of the State which are fundamental to the democratic process. I have read in various newspapers that colleagues have expressed delight at the demise of judges and court officials but people who take that short-term view are extremely foolish. This is part of how the system has been undermined and we must consider it in terms of restoring confidence. <Col N="1479" /> In that context, the Minister and his officials have done as well as possible in the face of a massive uphill struggle.</P>
    <P>In the week that Irish local government is 100 years old, it is sad that the tremendous contribution of so many people should have been badly sullied by the actions of so few. It is no harm to reflect on the enormous contribution made by many people who felt they could do something on behalf of their communities, whether urban or rural, and were prepared to give generously of their time to undertake that work. A large part of their efforts have been undermined and besmirched by the actions of a tiny minority. Would legislation have prevented that from happening? Will it prevent it happening in the future?</P>
    <P>Even if one doubts the efficacy of the entire mosaic of legislation the Government and its predecessors have sought to put in place, it is apparent that this matter cannot be dealt with in any other way. We are obliged to follow our current route and do the best we can to address the problems with which we are presented.</P>
    <P>The Bill is comprehensive and complicated because of the aims and requirements it is trying to meet and it sets out in considerable detail the roles of national and local party agents. Lengthy consideration is also given to the possible role of third parties. Some people minimised that issue when the Electoral Act was being debated in 1997 but it must be recognised and addressed. The Bill attempts, in so far as is possible, to address it.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the designated person in each local electoral area. On realising the onerous task they face, I suspect people who previously served, in a less formal way, as election agents and directors of elections for various parties or candidates will be reluctant to take on the position of designated person. In my opinion people will begin to refuse to serve in this new role when they realise the additional duties involved. If that is the case, it will again be a further diminution of public involvement in the State's system of democracy. I would lament the arrival of such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>Relatively little reference has been made to the provisions in sections 10, 11 and 12 which relate to the making of contracts and claims. I presume these sections are included because of the past experience of the major parties which have been presented with bills, about which they had no prior knowledge, from various constituencies following previous elections. The sections in question require that contracts must be made in respect of election expenses. However, I do not know whether there is a requirement that this must be declared in some form after the election. Consideration should be given to requiring that perhaps all contracts, particularly those involving sums in excess of £500, should be registered. In the context of openness and the protection of the major parties provided for in these three sections, the details of contracts should be made public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> I am not clear about how the details of income and expenditure will be set out, particularly in view of the fact that only donations amounting to £500 and over will be declarable. I presume the matter will be clarified when registration forms become available, but perhaps the Minister of State will refer to it in his reply.</P>
    <P>There are two levels of disclosure for political parties and, in light of the system that is already in operation, that is the only way this could be done in practice. However, it would be worth considering that declarations at national level should be made to the Public Offices Commission. As it stands, the Bill provides that such declarations should be made to one of the Dublin local authorities. In view of the expertise gathered by the Public Offices Commission and its dealings with parties, and given the fact that local authorities lack such expertise, the commission is better placed to receive national declarations.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge that formal arrangements be made to inform candidates of the requirements placed on them when they hand in their nominations before the operative date. Not being aware of these requirements would not be a defence in the event that the matter needed to be investigated subsequently. Nevertheless, in the interests of openness and clarity, it would be desirable that every person who puts forward his or her name for election ought to be given a document which sets out in considerable detail what is required of them.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 72 of the Electoral Act, in respect of which most Members have spoken, the Minister of State had little option than to reach the conclusion he did. I welcome that the manner in which the procedure will be arranged will be much more accessible at local level. I am not a candidate in the local elections but, having read the Bill, I am somewhat confused about the requirement on Oireachtas Members to furnish statements locally. The Bill appears to indicate that if they have already furnished an element of the expenditure in a statement to the Public Offices Commission, they are not required to furnish it to the local authority concerned during the election campaign. Under the legislation it is impossible to synchronise the dates involved and I expect it will be impossible to provide a single form which would enable people to furnish statements in a far clearer way. Local authority members who are not Oireachtas Members will be of the opinion that the latter will have the opportunity to refrain from disclosing part of their expenditure to local authorities and declare it as part of their annual statement to the Public Offices Commission. I am not sure whether this will create difficulties but people will raise that point.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not appear to indicate that, in the event that a person is a candidate for election as a county councillor, an urban district councillor or a town commissioner, one person to whom a statement can be furnished, will be designated. Under the terms of the Bill, it would be possible <Col N="1481" /> in some instances that a candidate seeking election to one or all of these positions would be obliged to furnish more than one statement. In that event, they might be required to provide details of the way they expended their funding in respect of the campaign to gain election to each position. That would be a complicated and cumbersome procedure.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that many of the matters to which Members have referred will be included in and are more appropriate to the debate on the local government Bill which is due to come before the House in the near future. I accept his point. When the Bill is introduced &ndash; as a member of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government I have already had an opportunity to contribute to its development &ndash; it will be necessary to broaden the definition relating to people who we consider to be members of or involved with local authorities.</P>
    <P>Members of county enterprise boards, non-councillor members of SPCs, members of Leader groups and many others have been given a substantial role in disbursing funds, setting agendas and deciding on policy and their actions have a bearing on how the economic lives of areas and individuals will develop. When debating the new all-encompassing legislation we will have to give careful consideration to the role of these people and ensure that they are dealt with in the same way as elected representatives who, regardless of the system's shortcomings, are at least answerable to the people. Local authority members cannot gain access to those fora by using short-term, narrow focus issues as a platform. The fora to which I refer ensure that a huge additional workload is placed on local authority members and they also dissipate the influence of directly elected representatives while increasing the influence of others.</P>
    <P>A number of Members referred to the need for a statutory right to time off for those elected to local authorities. Provision for this ought to be included in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the Planning Act, 1976, local authority members and officials are required to register their interests. The Bill before us represents an opportunity to extend and build upon that. The Minister of State referred to the need for a code of conduct and other requirements and consideration should be given to this.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the definition of election expenses. It is based closely on section 31 of the 1997 Electoral Act. It runs to four and a half pages. That section more than any other illustrates the difficulty in regulating this area. The more one reads it, the more one realises the difficulty in presenting legislation to address problems that have given rise to tribunals and various other scandals.</P>
    <P>That section includes almost two pages of exceptions. Some are sensible, such as expenses incurred by local authorities or by the Oireachtas on behalf of people, but many candidates in local elections might find others, such as those in sub<Col N="1482" /> section 1 (b) that sets out other day to day expenses, the most expensive ones. I agree with the inclusion of these exceptions, but they create greater difficulty for candidates in making their declarations. Declarations of expenses are by their nature subjective and subject to personal interpretation. The inclusion of these exceptions will mean that such declarations could be open to scrutiny by someone who has a different interpretation and approach to examining this type of expenditure.</P>
    <P>I am delighted section 18 provides for guidelines to be issued and that the Minister gave an undertaking in his speech to ensure they are provided as soon as possible. One of the difficulties is that some of the matters that will be declarable or some of the costs which will be declarable will have been incurred by candidates. Even though the declaration period will commence on 11 May or whatever will be the final date for candidates to sign on, anything they use subsequently that they have acquired and paid for will become declarable. That must be made clear to candidates. When one considers the options, it is obvious that must be the case, but the guidelines will be important in this regard.</P>
    <P>The other area which caused some difficulty is whether there ought to be an expenditure limit. That principle has been accepted for Oireachtas elections. The background against which it was accepted initially is understandable, but we must face up to the fact that we are enacting legislation, which together with the 1997 legislation, is extremely difficult to police. It is very difficult to interpret what constitutes expenditure, what the expenditure limit should be and what minor expenses, such as a telephone call to meet a person outside a school at 4 p.m. to go canvassing, should be included. These considerations are a great imposition on candidates who have bravely put forward their names and are working under pressure trying to do their best to ensure they succeed. Having dealt with these matters, perhaps we should examine in a much more meaningful way what ought to be the role of local authorities and their members. We should also examine why local authorities ought not to be the agencies applying directly for and spending European money, and making their case for what the elected members in the local community see as the requirements of the people they represent.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers said it would be relatively easy to provide photographs of candidates. I agree with the point made by Deputy Browne yesterday. People who suffer from dyslexia or are semi-literate, who have as much a right to vote as anybody else, would be greatly facilitated by such a measure. People with a sight difficulty would be more likely to recognise candidates from their photographs. It would also help where three or four candidates have the same surname on the ballot paper. The inclusion of candidates' photographs on the ballot paper would be a major advantage in helping the electorate to discern who is who. It would not be difficult to include <Col N="1483" /> their photographs. It would also show an interest in and a commitment to extending to everybody the meaning of the franchise and involvement in the democratic system. The issue of co-options which arise so frequently and cause such difficulty was referred to. That ought to be addressed in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>A major departure is provided for in section 25. It deals with the electronic counting of votes and the examination of the feasibility of operating that system. A great advantage of this system is it would rule out the randomness in the existing transfer of votes. While the existing system is fairly accurate, there is room for a substantial distortion in the figures where there are a number of candidates, particularly in regard to the transfer of subsequent surpluses. In cases where the margins are relatively small, there could be an incorrect result, but that could not happen under the new proposed system.</P>
    <P>A speaker yesterday indicated that he understood there would be a requirement to vote for all the candidates on the ballot paper, which has not been the tradition for many people. That could take some getting used to. It is also unclear whether voters ought to be required to vote a preference for each candidate on the ballot paper. Electors who voted a preference of 14 or 15 in a field of 14 or 15 candidates effectively would not have a vote as they would not be reached.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and areas approached in it. Given the timeframe available, it is understandable that the vast range of other issues relating to the business of local authorities that has not been addressed could not have been addressed.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to take part in this discussion. I have no difficulty with the Bill. I am mystified as to all the ballyhoo about the disclosure of expenses, donations or costs. It is more the myth about what is to be made out of public life than what is the real position that has caused all the interest from a public point of view. A journal was published covering everyone's salary &ndash; not only public representatives' salaries &ndash; in this country. No one sector should be singled out. It included salaries earned by the Judiciary, the Church, the professionals, civil servants, etc. If people want to read that, so be it. That may be their interest. I have served 25 years in public life and have not seen any gravy train or gold mine in it, but there is great satisfaction in serving the people. That is why I entered public life in 1974. I met numerous people who have since retired who have served a lifetime in public life. They were out of pocket and their businesses would have done a good deal better if they had spent more time on them. They had an ambition and <Col N="1484" /> an interest to serve the public at local or national level, but there was no reward in that.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a point I raised on the Order of Business this morning and yesterday about a small number of honourable decent public representatives who have served on county councils for 30 to 40 years but missed out on the retirement scheme that has been introduced. In one case a candidate, having completed 40 years of service, failed to get elected in the 1991 local election. As he did not serve during the last term he is not entitled to participate in the retirement scheme. That is unfair.</P>
      <P>This group of honourable people includes Fianna Fáil supporters. One man told me I could mention his name and I am proud to do so. We served on Cavan County Council and Cavan County Committee of Agriculture for 20 years and we could debate to and fro but we always remained good friends. I refer to the former councillor, Paddy Conaty, from Cavan town. He gave a lifetime to public service but he missed out on the retirement scheme. He did what the scheme proposes. He stepped aside to let a younger man, his son, Paddy junior, a marvellous young man, take over. He did what the scheme proposes, but he has been penalised for that. That is not fair. It makes the case for that man and for another elderly man in Mayo and I am sure there are many others.</P>
      <P>I know they are only a small group, but they should not be penalised. They should be rewarded. Some gesture should be made to them. After a certain period of time, councillors should receive a lump sum payment on retirement. That happens in all other aspects of life. There should be some reward because these people are out of pocket. The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, knows that. Like me, he has served on a county council. I know the cost that is involved. That is never taken on board even though one renders a public service. The idea of public representatives receiving large financial donations is nonsense. From my experience and that of others, one can buy publicity but not votes. Some people are foolish enough to go down that road, printing publicity leaflets and using advertising hoardings. One gentleman even went American style, importing stuff and throwing it around the towns and villages, as well as filling cars with petrol. People will not, however, be fooled for long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As public representatives we should have no difficulty about making full disclosure of donations and expenditure. If there is a reluctance to do so, people believe something is being hidden. As in every walk of life, a small number of people try to make a killing and abuse their positions. They represent a very small number, however, and politics is no better or worse than any other profession. I believe we are much better because we are in the public view. Many people behind the scenes may not have given the best service to their companies and may have made off with company funds. Such cases are coming to light almost daily in the newspapers <Col N="1485" /> with people being dismissed. Public representatives should not be singled out for different treatment. Let us get the matter out in the open, kill it off and get it out of the way. We can then get on with the job of work that has to be done.</P>
    <P>The country has never enjoyed better times. That could not have come about without the work of people in public life. When times were bad in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, people had to work hard to achieve something locally. Gradually, they built stone upon stone until we have reached the current position. No one party or individual can claim credit for that. It was achieved by a group of people who were committed, nationally and at local level, to a belief in building their country. We are now reaping the rewards. Let us not throw it all away with the myth that people are running off with the pot of gold. The sooner we get that idea out of the way the better. In that way, people will have confidence in those who serve them and in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Young people can become very disillusioned and they believe what they read. I do not see any journalists in the press gallery. I will not criticise them for that, but they would be very quick to criticise us if they saw only two Deputies in the Chamber. I have no doubt the journalists are diligently working behind the scenes, but some of them try to dig deeper to see if they can expose something that is not there.</P>
    <P>Apparently, we are going to remove the dual mandate from public representatives who serve on local authorities. I am glad to note that a senior member of the Fianna Fáil party is shaking his head. I am opposed to that because one can stay close to the people only by being a member of a local authority. That is where the real nuts and bolts of ordinary everyday problems are brought to light and discussed. Every time I attend a local authority meeting, it is an education to listen to the issues raised and the representations made there. I have a dual mandate for both county and urban district councils. Urban problems are not the same as rural ones. I can also raise such problems in the House through parliamentary questions to the relevant Minister or in a debate. I am well briefed by representations made by people I meet. Public representatives have a large circle of people to whom they listen. We should think twice about doing away with the dual mandate. It would be a retrograde step. We should back away from the idea. It is not a case of double jobbing. It is a case of people stretching themselves to provide better representation to those who elect them.</P>
    <P>This year local authorities are celebrating their centenary. It is ironic, therefore, that this discussion has arisen now. However, it is important that it has arisen after 100 years of local democracy. The decision to abolish local committees of agriculture was a retrograde step. Never would it have been more important to have such bodies in place than in the past year. They could have played an important role in highlighting the prob<Col N="1486" /> lems farmers are facing and arranged to have more done about them.</P>
    <P>Local authority members sit on vocational education committees which are doing a constructive job in education. Health boards are also doing a constructive job. Deputy Killeen made the very relevant point that local authority members on such committees are publicly accountable. There is an attitude that people who are not public representatives should be nominated to partnership boards, but that is wrong. We should not go down that road. There must be public accountability and one will have it if local authority members serve on such boards. I am not saying they should have all the places, but they should have the majority of them because they are accountable. We should not belittle our position in public life and hand it over to people who would be reluctant to put their hats in the ring to have their neighbours and friends pass judgment on them in the privacy of the ballot box every five years.</P>
    <P>It is important to clean up the image of public life and get away from the notion of the gravy train. People in public life are more often out of pocket than they are rewarded for their work. The honour of serving on a local authority or in the Dáil is a great privilege. Some 99 per cent of those I have met in the House, from the large and small parties, are honourable, hard-working and decent people. A small number can give us a bad image, but we should not be judged by that.</P>

      <P>Last week, Mayo County Council &ndash; like every other county council in the State &ndash; celebrated 100 years of democracy. We are very proud of Mayo County Council and our three urban councils. Politics and politicians tend to have a bad name. At times the media find it easy to target and criticise us. When something critical is written, it is difficult to correct it. It is like the issue of Dáil expenses. They can publish the expenses one receives, but they can never justify what is spent in terms of one's secretary and office. There must be fair play on both sides. I have been a member of Mayo County Council and of Westport Urban District Council for more than 20 years.</P>
      <P>I thank those who served before me, who got no expenses or anything else from the system. They served their communities, counties, towns and villages. They deserve thanks for the public service they rendered. Public life is not easy. Whether one is an urban district councillor, a county councillor or a Dáil Deputy, there are times when one has to make decisions that one considers to be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of Ireland, including the west, does not have the problem of rezoning that is particular to Dublin. Because certain things have happened and are happening in Dublin, and because certain politicians have given the political system a bad name, it is wrong to tarnish all public representatives with the same brush. In Mayo, we would be delighted if we could get people who wanted to rezone land. Our problem is that we have plenty <Col N="1487" /> of land but no people. There is never a question of getting land rezoned. We would love to have that problem, with developers coming into the county to develop it. The State has done little to assist Knock airport. We hoped it would be the lifeline to help our county and that people would invest there. That did not happen, however, because we did not get the necessary infrastructure from central Government.</P>
    <P>My party will table a motion under Private Members' Business next week to debate the gridlock in Dublin. As a rural Deputy, I am delighted to see that gridlock. For the past 20 years, politicians have brought people into Dublin. Now they have gridlock and it will cost millions of pounds to resolve the problem. Poor rural Ireland will be left out again. European funds will have to be used to solve the problems caused by all Governments in the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>There will be no restriction on funding in the forthcoming local elections, though there were restrictions in place for the 1997 election. In future election candidates and parties will only be allowed to spend a certain amount; that is welcome. It may stop the &ldquo;brown paper bags&rdquo; if people do not have the excuse of accepting donations for elections. I fought many wealthy people in elections, but money does not buy votes, thank God. Money will not get a person into the county council or the Dáil because people choose wisely. A person who buys drink, advertises in the local newspaper and sends out newsletters will find that that does not buy votes. People look at the quality of candidate who stands for election.</P>
    <P>There may not have been as many people voting in the last few years as we would like, but that is because of the bad press politics and politicians attract. The media are right to highlight deficiencies in the system and to show up those who are corrupt. I compliment them on doing that, but they should also show the positive side of local authorities. If there is a row at a county council meeting that gets the headlines in the local newspapers. The hours of good work and sanctioning of roads, housing, sewerage and water schemes are ignored. That never gets a headline; negativity gets headlines. There should be some balance. The negative aspects should be shown but the positive elements of council meetings should also be shown.</P>
    <P>People have served on local authorities for little or no reward. They have done so to serve others. When I entered politics 20 years ago I thought I would be able to change the system. I thought I would be able to teach the officials how things should be done. However, the sad fact is that officials control Members. I do not know if the Minister and the Minister of State have the courage to deal with the problem of managerial orders. I do not know if Fianna Fáil has the courage to do so; my party did not. The managers have too many powers. Who gives them these powers? The officials in the Department of the <Col N="1488" /> Environment and Local Government. Does anyone think one official is going to let another down? They will make sure they keep those powers. I hope the local government Bill will make sure that these powers go back to the people and the members. The ridiculous powers given to managers must be taken from them.</P>
    <P>It outrages me when I table questions to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that are answered by an official with the words &ldquo;not the responsibility of the Minister&rdquo;. That gets the manager to answer the question directly. This is the Parliament; it is where things should happen but that is not the case. If people knew what was really going on they would be outraged to know that, instead of Members controlling officials, the officials control Members.</P>
    <P>I spoke against the Freedom of Information Bill, as did Fianna Fáil Deputies. However, we did not have the courage to vote against it. It is the most outrageous and ridiculous Bill that was ever brought before the House. All it did was ensure that the media got a chance to crucify Deputies. Why could that Bill not ensure we found out how much expenses county managers or top civil servants get? We cannot put questions down on how much they earn.</P>
    <P>Which Government will have the courage to take on officialdom? A previous speaker referred to the planning system, but we will have a revolution in the county council system if the dog continues to lead the man instead of the man leading the dog. Public representatives are being led by officials and we have no powers. They sit in council meetings like lapdogs. If I am returned to the next Dáil and see legislation planned that is similar to previous Bills dealing with this issue I will be voting with the Opposition. It is time backbenchers from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour got together to protect Members' interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a lot of truth in Deputy Ring's contribution, even if I disagree with one or two points. However, I do not disagree with him on the role of the public representative and on the almost anti-democratic stance we have taken by giving more and more power to non-elected persons. Deputy Boylan also made a very decent and honest contribution that was full of common sense, and in many ways it was the epitome of what local government is all about. Local government is about people putting themselves forward to serve their communities. Last week Wicklow County Council published its centenary volume, entitled &ldquo;For the Betterment of the People&rdquo;. The title was chosen from a council member's contribution in a debate, and that is what local government is about: it is about the betterment of the people, not the enrichment of the few. Sadly, people have lost sight of that reality. The vast majority of men and women who have served on local authorities at all levels in the last 100 years have been decent, honourable and respectable public representatives. It strikes me as very sad that, due to recent legislation, we are <Col N="1489" /> further limiting the role of local representatives in the centenary year of local government.</P>
      <P>There were two fundamental principles that informed the basis of local government when it was set up 100 years ago. The first was the administrative principle, and the second was the political principle. The administrative principle &ndash; subsequently retitled the concept of subsidiarity &ndash; suggested that those activities, actions and administrative functions which could be handled by a junior or subsidiary authority should be so handled, and only those which could not be handled by a lower level authority should percolate upwards to the central State. However, over the past 75 years in Ireland we have produced the most centralised democracy in Europe. The Lord Mayor of Dublin has less power than the mayor of the most minor commune in France. That is extraordinary, yet public administration students have always referred to French public administration as being highly centralised. It is in the halfpenny place in comparison to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The last two contributions were radically different, but they touched on various aspects of this. I look forward to the Minister producing his major opus on local government reform. Like Deputies Ring, Boylan, Killeen and others, I will be looking for a reversal of the trend. I was a civil servant for more years than I have been a public representative, but I have always been critical of the centralist mentality which has been absolutely ingrained in the Civil Service since 1922. When President de Gaulle said: &ldquo;<i>L'État, c'est moi</i>&rdquo; he was reflecting a viewpoint that is absolutely endemic in central administration, the Sir Humphreys rule and let us never forget it. The most inspired piece of television script writing ever was &ldquo;Yes Minister.&rdquo;  When I crossed the divide from administration to politics, my ex-Minister asked me if I had written the script for that series. I could easily have done so.</P>
      <P>No area of public life engenders more hypocrisy regarding political contributions than local government reform. Local government reform is rarely a high priority for Government parties but it is a major driving force for the Opposition. We should put these attitudes behind us and try to produce a response to the issues which are killing local government. We must deal with the issues of structure. We must define the appropriate roles for local government, as recommended by the White Paper of 1971, and devise a proper funding system for local government, as recommended by the 1972 White Paper on Finance. We must then establish where the balance of power lies between the Minister and the Department on one hand and the local authority on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the second principle informing the Local Government Act, 1898. At the core of that Act was the principle that local services should not merely be administered locally but also determined locally, that local public representatives should decide the services to be provided, how they should be funded and what the priorities in those services should be, and those local rep<Col N="1490" /> resentatives should be directly answerable to the electorate. This Bill is concerned with how local representatives relate to the electorate.</P>
    <P>I do not support all the Minister's proposals for local government but I welcome this Bill. The Minister is aware of my views on some of his proposals and I will return to this question later. This Bill is necessary because of the unprincipled and selfish behaviour of the small minority who have besmirched public life. To listen to some of the absent media, one would think membership of my party was a hanging offence. It has become very easy to tie labels onto groups of people. Last weekend the Sunday newspapers behaved in an extraordinary manner, declaring people guilty by association without specifying the offence of which they were guilty. Guilt by association and sneering comments about brown paper bags affect everyone in public life. For all its failings, democracy is a better system than any of the alternatives. All political parties are finding it increasingly difficult to persuade good people who could make a contribution to political life to stand for election. This is because of the manner in which everyone in local government has been tarred with the brush of corruption.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of two local authorities in County Wicklow since the mid-1980s. I am quite an acute observer of human behaviour and I have seen no evidence of corruption on any scale. I and my colleagues, from my own party, other parties and none, are dedicated to serving the people and to the concept of the betterment of the people. It is sad and reprehensible that people who do not have the courage to put their names before the public should sit in judgment on those who do. Only the electorate can make a judgment on an elected representative. If people elect rogues and knaves they will get local government that is destroyed by roguery and knavery. If they elect honest people they will get honest local government. On 11 June next, the people will exercise their choice and they will select the men and women who will represent them. I have no doubt that, as on every occasion since 1899, the public will elect people who are decent and honest and not corrupt and motivated by the highest ideals. We should not be ashamed to say that.</P>
    <P>I was so struck by Deputy Boylan's contribution that I have departed from what I intended to say. He reminded us of the honesty, decency and integrity which marks public life in Ireland. Like Deputy Ring, he observed that some of those who have a prurient curiosity about the expenses of Deputies, Senators, councillors and town commissioners are excessively secretive about their own finances. I smiled recently when I heard on RTE &ndash; our well-subsidised moral guardian &ndash;  broadcasters berating public representatives for their lack of openness regarding their expenses. The same people go into paroxysms of fear when Oireachtas committees ask about the salaries of Gaybo, Pat or the other performers at the RTE microphones.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> The Minister has prudently decided to deal with the question of expenses. The Bill would be strengthened if there was a way to limit electoral expenses. I agree with the Minister of State when he said that an across-the-board limit on expenses would be extremely difficult to implement but what has been referred to as a lacuna in the Bill is not informed by a reluctance on the Minister's part to deal with the matter of election expenses.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister examine the use of election funds. This is not a revolutionary suggestion. Last week the Green Party, a party which often talks about integrity, spent taxpayers' money on huge full-page newspaper advertisements in my local newspapers. I agree with previous speakers that advertising does not win votes but it puts a very large hole in electoral budgets. Why can local radio or television stations not carry individually sponsored political advertisements while the print media can? Why does the same rule not apply to all the media? Why not ban political advertising in all the media? Such a ruling would save millions. At the last general election, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left between them spent £2.5 million on advertising. I doubt if it produced a single vote. The print media can place a gun to candidates' heads and oblige them to buy advertisements. During the forthcoming local election campaign, special editions of free sheets will be produced and an inference will be made that candidates will receive editorial cover only if they buy advertising space. A Fine Gael Deputy told me that in his part of the country, local election candidates agreed to limit their advertising. Unfortunately, such common sense is not found in other constituencies. I accept that to impose a cap on expenditure on every candidate in every local authority area would be extremely difficult but the Minister should examine the possibility of banning major billboard advertising and putting a cap on newspaper advertising. Such a measure would produce results.</P>
    <P>Corruption creeps in when the system becomes difficult to fund and politics is not a cheap activity. We no longer paint slogans on the road with a brush and a bucket of whitewash or tar. We are rightly prevented from doing so. The personal canvass and a newsletter setting out one's achievements over the previous five years are the most effective forms of electioneering. It should be possible to carry out meaningful electoral activity without spending huge amounts of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>These questions raise issues as to what administrative and staffing changes may arise in the State law offices arising out of the reports of the Chief Justice and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a result of the early release of Mr. Philip Sheedy.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Attorney General had no direct involvement in the Sheedy case. The Office of the Chief State Solicitor, which is a constituent part of that office, acted at all times as solicitor to the Director of Public Prosecutions and on his instructions. As an indirect consequence of these events, the proposals brought to Government last week by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to judicial accountability and sentencing policy may impose on the time and resources of the Attorney General and his staff in the provision of legal advice and, if necessary, drafting of legislation.</P>
      <P>The report on the involvement of the Chief State Solicitor's office in relation to the case of the DPP<i> v. </i>Sheedy has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In this report the Chief State Solicitor sets out a chronology of events and deals with outstanding issues. He expresses the view that having regard to the extraordinary manner in which the case was dealt with, he is not convinced that any fundamental changes in procedures are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report fully addresses the issues raised in the reports of the Chief Justice and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Chief State Solicitor goes on to conclude that reporting arrangements between his office and that of the DPP need to be improved and that the lack of clarity in listing and notification procedures requires examination and redress. He has directed that the solicitor in charge of the trials section in his office should review cases in the <Col N="1496" /> court list before close of business on the date cases are heard.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in his functions and my comments must be confined to matters of administration relating to that office. The DPP has carefully considered the recent reports and does not consider that either report carries any implication for staffing changes in his office. He is consulting with the Chief State Solicitor on reporting procedures.</P>
    <P>The more general question as to how the solicitor's service to the prosecution process is organised is currently under examination by the study group on the public prosecution system under the chairmanship of Mr. Dermot Nally. I will await the outcome of that examination before expressing a view on what the appropriate structural arrangements between the DPP's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office should be. The House will be aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights is conducting an examination of the events surrounding the Sheedy case. Its report will inform any further steps which may be required.</P>

      <P>It is not possible for the House to assess what changes are necessary in the Chief State Solicitor's office to avoid a recurrence of this event without knowing why it occurred. My question refers directly to the need for and nature <Col N="1497" /> of any administrative changes which may have to be made in the offices covered by this question. It is only when we know why it occurred will we know what we should do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not in its entirety in the hands of the committee. The Government agreed to pension arrangements for the people concerned which committed the State to the expenditure of significant sums of money. We need to know why that eventuality has arisen. We also need to know why the reports, which are the subject matter of these questions, were necessary. These reports were necessitated only because of the extraordinary handling of a particular case. If we have answers on the reports, it is reasonable to ask why they were necessary. If the Taoiseach is not able to answer why these reports were necessary, which I assume he is not, will he indicate when he expects he will be able to get the people concerned, who can answer it, to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

Has the Secretary to the Government received detailed written replies to the letters he issued to the two judges and, if so, do those replies contain any additional information to what is already on the public record? Will the full text of the letter issued by the Secretary to the Government to the persons concerned be made public?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government considered facilitating further explanations being given by issuing privilege to witnesses who might appear to answer questions as to why the chain of events occurred which necessitated the reports? Has the issue of privilege in terms of defamation or the prosecutable nature of anything which might be disclosed been contemplated or has it been requested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe a question was raised on behalf of one of the people involved. The Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, <Col N="1498" /> Equality and Law Reform have been addressing the reply to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Trying to stay within the confines you set, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to ask a number of questions. On the Government's responsibility to ensure there is a facility in the House for a full debate, has consideration been given to give a specific order to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights giving it a clear mandate to ensure a facility is put in place to invite the personages, and on what basis?</P>
      <P>Will the compellability of witnesses legislation be amended to enable judges or former judges to be summoned to the committee? What is the Government's response to the Chief Justice's statement today which makes another proposal? On the conclusions of the Chief State Solicitor's report, does the Taoiseach agree with the conclusion in paragraph 17 that there is a lack of clarity in court listings and notification procedures in criminal cases and that an examination of this matter would be beneficial and, if so, what does the Government propose to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Howlin's first question, this is a matter which probably relates to the legal advice of the committee. The Attorney General is considering the issue to see how it fits in with the compellability of constitutional positions and related matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government aware of his views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not be aware of them until we get a report from the Attorney General. He has been considering the matter for the past day or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful for the chairman and the committee to receive that report before they proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General's views will be useful, as are those expressed by the Ceann Comhairle in a letter to party leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Chief Justice's report and its effect on the office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Chief State Solicitor has stated that there is a lack of clarity in the listing procedure. He has called for the system to be amended and I agree with his view. The Chief State Solicitor seems to emphasise that the senior solicitor from his office should effectively carry out an audit of the day's cases against the list. He also intends to cross-reference that with what happens in the DPP's office and intends to meet the DPP to discuss the matter. I have answered questions in this House on a number of occasions about what happens solicitors' work in the prosecution of cases which, since 1974, occurs in the office of the Chief State Solicitor although the office works directly to the DPP. That issue is being examined by the <Col N="1499" /> Nally committee which is to make its final recommendations by the end of June.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice today stated he is to receive the report of the working group on the Courts Commission. The report was completed in November and covers judicial conduct and ethics. The sixth report of the working group was published last Friday by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its recommendations were immediately accepted.</P>
    <P>Steps were taken to establish a judicial committee as recommended by the group. The judicial committee comprises the presidents of each court, namely the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court &ndash; Mr. Justice Frederick Morris, the President of the Circuit Court &ndash; Mr. Justice Edmund Smith and the President of the District Court &ndash; Mr. Peter Smithwick. Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, past chairperson of the working group, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, past president of the Law Reform Commission and the Attorney General, Mr. David Byrne SC, are also members of the committee. The Attorney General will represent the public interest on the committee. The committee will consider the sixth report of the working group on the Courts Commission and consider further the positions which apply in other jurisdictions such as Canada, New South Wales, the US and New Zealand. It will consult the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Bar Council, the Law Society, academics and others, receive submissions from interested bodies, advise on and prepare the way for the establishment of a judicial body which would contribute to high standards of judicial conduct, establish a system for the handling of complaints about judicial conduct and other activities and carry out other preparatory work, including work relating to standards and ethics. The committee will also consider matters which have arisen since the sixth report was finalised last November.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice has stated that it is proposed to commence work immediately and publish a report on the committee's conclusions. The Government totally supports this. The Attorney General will represent the public interest, not the Government but consultation will occur with Ministers and the Government will do everything it can to assist the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that it has been stated in recent weeks that the Government will &lsquo;reconsider' the sixth report which has now been published, will the Taoiseach inform the House if, when Mrs. Justice Denham completed the report in November, the Government considered it and rejected its findings or decided not to do anything about it? When did the Government first consider the report and why was it not adopted in November? Did it go before the Cabinet at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A letter from the DPP's office to all State solicitors was attached to the CSSO's report pub<Col N="1500" /> lished last Friday. Has the Taoiseach asked the Attorney General what happened the instruction to prosecuting counsel not to participate in plea bargaining behind closed doors? Has he ascertained whether prosecuting counsel participated in such discussions in the Sheedy case after June 1998? The DPP stated that such instruction would be &ldquo;of doubtful conformity with Article 34.1 of the Constitution&rdquo;. Has the Taoiseach ascertained whether solicitors, barristers or prosecution teams participated in such plea bargaining in the Sheedy case? </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know nothing about that although I am aware that the letter was issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach ask the Attorney General to ensure the instructions were being followed? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not. The DPP is an independent office holder and it would not be a matter for the Attorney General to ensure the contents of any letter sent out by the DPP would be implemented. I assume the DPP's instructions were adhered to; I have no evidence that they were not.</P>
      <P>On the sixth report of the working group, the report was discussed by the Department and recently sanctioned by the Government. To the best of my recollection, it was not discussed by the Government around Christmas. There was extensive discussion prior to that between the Attorney General and the committee. The Attorney General made some fairly major submissions as part of the report early last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the recent statement that the Government was adopting and publishing the report, the word &lsquo;reconsidered' was used. That implies that the report had been considered at an earlier stage. The report was completed last November; did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform bring it to Cabinet at the time and did the Government decide not to publish it? The report was only published in the past week when the Sheedy case blew up. I am trying to ascertain what happened the report when it was actually completed.</P>

        <b>:</b> I want to ask about the performance of the office of the Chief State Solicitor. On 12 November, this case which was originally listed as no. 19 was mysteriously promoted to no. 9. It is now acknowledged that when the case was called, the person representing the office of the Chief State Solicitor, Ms Eileen Creedon, had left the court chamber to take a telephone call. Therefore, the State was not represented by anybody with the right of audience other than a junior law clerk, Mr. Stephen Browne. Has the identity of Ms Creedon's caller been established and what was the call's subject matter? Could this call have been a deliberate attempt to absent Ms Creedon from the court?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, does the Chair agree that whether or not a telephone is used in mid sitting to convey instructions to solicitors in court is an administrative issue and is relevant to the question which concerns administrative practices in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor? If use of a telephone to communicate with people who have to leave the court in order to receive the message is normal practice, it comes within the remit of the study which has been done. Deputy Higgins is simply asking what information the Taoiseach can give on who initiated this call and why the call necessitated the solicitor leaving the court where the solicitor ought to have been. I submit that this question is entirely with the remit of the Chair's ruling and of the question allowed by it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of national schemes for the control of farm pollution and for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards were submitted to the European Commission for approval in February last. The terms as submitted provided for a uniform grant rate of 40 per cent throughout the country of approved costs subject to a maximum grant of £10,000 in the case of the scheme for control of farm pollution and a maximum grant of £7,000 in the case of the scheme for the improvement in dairy hygiene standards.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month the European Commission raised queries about certain aspects of the proposed measures. The Commission indicated that a grant rate of 35 per cent is the maximum allowable in areas other than less favoured areas. My Department has responded to those queries and has agreed to the maximum 35 per cent grant rate required by EU rules in areas other than less favoured areas. The intention is that a 40 per cent grant rate would apply in the less favoured areas. My desire to have both schemes approved at the earliest opportunity was again impressed on the Commission and my officials have been in contact with the Commission to finalise any outstanding points. I hope to get an early agreement on these measures.</P>
      <P>The proposed schemes are targeted at small to medium sized farmers and will be directed at those farmers participating in the rural environmental protection scheme or those following a nutrient management plan. Environmental requirements have been given major prominence in the measures agreed in the EU Agenda 2000 negotiations. It was, therefore, considered timely to strengthen pollution control requirements in any new measures being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the discontinuation on the three year derogation on the nutrient waste manage<Col N="1509" /> ment plan in the REPS scheme, the position is that the derogation in the earlier specifications allowed applicants up to three years in which to put housing, etc., in place and required that the participants ensured that there was not any pollution in the meantime. The revised REPS specifications impose the same requirements regarding pollution control but where housing is required the specifications place the responsibility on the planner to determine when these pollution control investments will be put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister waiting for the European and county council elections before making an announcement? It is looking very like that. There does not appear to be any other reason.</P>
      <P>Everybody had understood that the minimum grant aid would be 40 per cent. Surely the Minister will pay it across the country and will not subject farmers to a level lower than 40 per cent. It is a long way from the original proposal. Will he confirm his intention to ensure that farmers do not have to accept anything less than a 40 per cent grant irrespective of where they are located?</P>
      <P>What priority will the Minister give the REPS funds? What categories of farmers can expect to start building immediately? What are the Minister's priorities? He said he would give priority to farmers involved with REPS. The three year derogation will be a huge deterrent to farmers who have a pollution problem because they will not be able to tackle it until they build a slatted house and keep the same amount of cattle over the winter as they have at present. Will the Minister comment on this?</P>

      <P>At the end of last year £25 million was allocated by the Department of Finance to the Estimate of my Department for these on-farm investment schemes. That was necessary given that the previous Government abolished the schemes. We renewed them with the aid of that money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows they constitute a State aid, which must be approved by the EU. We in the Department consulted the social partners, specifically the farm representative bodies, to outline the guidelines for the scheme. Early in the year the scheme was sent to Brussels and we sought priority approval for it. A number of quer<Col N="1510" /> ies have been made and I hope the last query was submitted earlier this month. We responded to it immediately. I again emphasise the priority we sought for the control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes. I expect we will get approval in a matter of days.</P>
      <P>Our proposal contained an across the board 40 per cent rate of grant. The EU responded by saying there should be a differential between less favoured areas and the general areas of the country and that it should be 40 per cent in the disadvantaged areas and 35 per cent in the more advantaged areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the nutrient derogation there was initially a three year derogation. However, EU auditors and Department inspectors found that farmers took the full three years before bothering too much about pollution control. The EU Commission, which is making the vast bulk of REPS payments, insisted that the pollution specification should be tidied up. The compromise was that the planner should decide when responsibility for pollution control investments would come into effect. That is a reasonable and fair way of proceeding. A substantial amount of money has been paid to farmers under the REPS scheme. Given that £175 million will be paid this year, it is fair and reasonable that there should be an improvement in the environment of farmyards, farm entrances and farms generally because the EU will not pay indefinitely. Next year I expect that more than £200 million per annum will be involved. Given this substantial payment for REPS, it is in the interests of farmers and the country to ensure we are giving value for it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the sum of £25 million made available in the last budget is the reason he is not announcing the two measures, the slatted house control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene, because under the old scheme many farmers had to be paid first with the result that there is not much of that sum left? He knows that very few farmers will get grants for the remainder of the year. Despite the fact that the numbers will be very small on this occasion, there will be enough for the European elections. The Minister is playing politics with the situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the derogation on the REPS scheme, to go from a three year derogation to none is a remarkable quantum leap. The Minster knows the only reason farmers do not control farmyard pollution is that they are not able to provide what is necessary and that is why the grant aid is needed. That is why I ask the Minister to revert to Brussels, otherwise very few extra small farmers will be able to avail of REPS.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already issued a statement responding to the report referred to by the Deputy in which I said that in drawing up the detailed EU rules arising from the Agenda 2000 reforms I would insist that the Commission delivers on its commitment to administrative simplification. I would also like to see a greater degree of proportionality in the application of penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the importance of these direct payments to farmers, representing, as they did, some 56 per cent of farm incomes in 1998. <Col N="1512" /> This proportion is set to increase in the coming years following from the successful outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. I have always stressed the importance of keeping scheme documentation as simple as possible and it is my objective that the improvements in delivery of these payments which have been achieved in recent years is built on and that the service provided by my Department to farmers is efficient, fair, friendly and transparent.</P>
    <P>Application forms have been simplified each year in consultation with the farming bodies and client friendly help sheets are provided for applicants under the various schemes. The all-party committee report confirms that the European Commission had indicated to the committee that the forms used in Ireland were easier to understand than those used by other member states. I fully acknowledge that the incorrect transcription or misreading of cattle identification numbers has been an ongoing problem in the completion of application forms. In this regard the introduction of printed cattle identification documents and the use of associated bar coding, which obviates the need for entering identification numbers, is now in use for most applications processed under the special beef premium schemes. This should substantially eliminate this particular cause of error.</P>
    <P>My aim is to ensure that the possibility for mistakes and misunderstandings in completing scheme applications is minimised and I will be keeping in close contact with the farm bodies and Teagasc on this matter. Penalties for technical breaches of the regulations are set out in clear terms under the EU regulations. I should also point out that, in their oral presentation to the all-party committee, the European Commission representatives pointed out that the number of penalties imposed under the special beef premium scheme in Ireland &ldquo;rather pointed to a reluctance to impose sanctions than the opposite.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In so far as delivery of these payments is concerned, a recent analysis of performance across member states confirmed that Ireland's performance in delivering the direct payment schemes is among the best in the EU and compares very favourably with that of other member states. For example, for most schemes Ireland rated between first and fifth among the 15 member states in terms of early payment in the 1997/8 scheme year. Ireland was first, for example, in the arable aid and ewe premium schemes, third in the suckler cow scheme and fifth in the special beef premium scheme. I am satisfied that we can build on that achievement over the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister seen a copy of this report because I do not think any of the rest of us has? We rely on leaks to find out what is happening, although I made a contribution to the committee's examination of it. I see it as a useful summary of events which have unfolded over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> Is it true that it is suggested in the report that a properly resourced independent appeals system should be established to deal with farmers' complaints, that such an appeals system, which would be independent, readily accessible, quick to respond, properly resourced and empowered to enforce its decisions, would be similar to the social welfare appeals system  and that farmers would have an opportunity to present oral evidence at such appeals?</P>
    <P>Why was the use of affidavits done away with, where somebody makes a simple error or wants to verify that he or she left the form at a particular office and swears on oath that he or she did so? Why is that no longer acceptable to the Department? Is it because the EU instructed the Department not to permit it? I find it extraordinary that the use of an affidavit, a solemn declaration on oath, of a farmer that he or she submitted the forms has been rejected by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that they indicated that a principle of law has developed in this country and in the European Court of Justice on proportionality. Is it the Minister's intention to ensure that that principle of law would guide the interpretation of regulations by his officials?</P>
    <P>I heard a senior official of the Department state that one should not blame the Department's officials, and I agree. It was politicians of all parties who went to Brussels and agreed the schemes. Does the Minister intend to go to Brussels and seek the amendment of regulations which impose draconian penalties on farmers for human errors?</P>

      <P>I have a copy of this report and I hope every Member of the House has a copy. This is a report of an all-party Oireachtas committee on the strategic management initiative. I assumed that everybody had a copy of it. If Deputy Penrose does not have a copy, I suggest that the Clerk to the Committee be contacted and asked to make it available to every Member.</P>
      <P>It is an important report. I am studying the recommendations in it. As the Deputy correctly stated, one of the recommendations of the report is the establishment of a properly resourced, accessible and independent appeals system similar to those operated by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large amount of money paid to producers in Ireland in direct payments and other<Col N="1514" /> wise. The EU Commission official who met the committee stated that the Department of Agriculture and Food must operate within the rules and regulations of the Commission to ensure that EU moneys are properly spent; if the Department fails to operate the rules and regulations properly, this would lead to a financial correction or prosecution in the European Court; and control systems are required to ensure that EU money is properly disbursed and accounted for. He emphasised that all controls systems must conform with EU regulations. As late as this morning, the Deputy will have heard on the radio one of the EU auditors talking about the importance of having controls and accountability in the payment of moneys.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year there are disallowances and some people are quick to highlight those disallowances. In fact, they do not refer to them as disallowances but as corrupt payments, fraudulent payments, etc. The facts are that Ireland, as a member state, and the Department of Agriculture and Food, as a paying agency, have the responsibility to be accountable for the payments of large amounts of money.</P>
      <P>That said, I subscribe to the view that if a person inadvertently makes an error in filling out a form, he or she should not be penalised adversely. There should be some degree of proportionality. There should be a requirement that the intention was inadvertent unless there was <i>prima facie</i> evidence of fraud involved. I am having a look at that.</P>
      <P>If an independent appeals body took lenient decisions and it was not part of the Department, nonetheless the Department would be responsible for any disqualifications and disallowances. My understanding is that, for example, the staff in the appeals unit of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are staff of the Department.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the point Deputy Penrose made on behalf of the farmers concerned. I want to make two points in that regard. First, I would ask farmers to be a little more careful in filling out the forms and to read the cards instead of just taking them off the shelf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The McKinsey report on the beef industry, which was commissioned by Enterprise Ireland at my request, concluded that there is a substantial degree of over-capacity in slaughtering facilities in the beef sector in Ireland. The report estimated that the removal of half of the excess capacity would be worth £18 million per annum in immediate cash savings to the industry and recommended that the surplus capacity should be removed. The recommended means of removing the excess capacity was by means of an exit fund formed by the processing industry itself.</P>
      <P>The beef task force, which I established last November, is currently preparing an action plan for the future development of the beef industry. This action plan will address all the constraints facing the industry at present, including the over-capacity and the need for rationalisation of slaughtering facilities. The views put forward by McKinsey are being considered in this context. It is my understanding that the task force has not yet finalised a definitive position in regard to the implementation of a programme of rationalisation. When I have received the report of the task force I will examine its recommendations.</P>

      <P>That was a sidestep if I ever heard one. The dogs in the street know the stage at which the committee reviewing the McKinsey report is, yet the Minister of State tells us that because the committee's deliberations have not concluded, he does not know what he will do next. Will he introduce legislation to impose a levy on all factories? If not, how does he propose to impose one? While there is overcapacity in processing, will he give a guarantee that the cost of whatever rationalisation takes place will under no circumstances be borne by farmers? Will he give an undertaking that it will not be possible for meat companies, such as Irish Country Meats in Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen, to offload parts of their businesses under this programme? As a result of the McKinsey report they might find it easier to accept a compensation payment and close. Given the location of such factories, there would then be no competition, for instance, in the west.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised this matter on a number of occasions on the Adjournment etc. and he has had access to all the available information. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed in regard to this programme. The Deputy is well aware that there is massive overca<Col N="1516" /> pacity in the industry. He is also aware that we are facing a rationalisation process and agreement on that is necessary for the future of the industry. A total of 1.6 million animals are slaughtered in 38 licensed factories but one operator controls 38 per cent of the industry.</P>
      <P>There is also massive undercutting in the marketplace while Ireland exports approximately 60 per cent of its beef to third countries. We must get to grips with the problem. I have stood on public platforms with the Deputy and admired what he has said about having a more organised approach to the beef industry, including the marketing and promotion of products. If we can get our house in order and reach agreement on this, statutory levying will not be required. The farming community is conscious that it will have to pay another levy and we are also conscious of that problem. They have lobbied us and told us that they do not want another levy, nor do the organisations representing producers want another levy. Agreement will be reached on this because we will keep working until a programme is in place to rationalise the industry.</P>
      <P>We have no control over what ICM or any other organisation does. It is part of the private sector, the enterprise society, and long may that last. Anything we do is not damaging to the industry. Our job is to regulate and promote the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement provides for some compensation for the 20 per cent reduction in the institutional price for beef to be provided through a national envelope which will be phased in over three years beginning on 1 January 2000. The level of national envelope will increase from £8.2 million in 2000 to £25.7 million in 2002. While the detailed rules for expenditure of the national envelope funds have not yet been adopted by the European Commission, I expect that member states will have considerable discretion as to how they spend these funds. I intend to consult the farming organisations on the optimum use of the funding before I arrive at any decision on the allocation of the national envelope. This consultation process will begin when the detailed rules are published by the Commission.</P>
      <P>With regard to the dairy sector, compensation payments for milk under Agenda 2000 will commence from 2005. I will, therefore, examine various options for payment from the national envelope for milk in the intervening period.</P>

      <P>I have already entered discussions in regard to the disbursement of the national envelope. I will give the Deputy an absolute guarantee that we will get the widest discretion as a member state in terms of spending the national envelope. A national envelope is very useful to iron out anomalies and gaps left by the old regime. At the same time, in terms of the payments which have been approved, Ireland obtained a slaughter premium for all animals, including heifers and live cattle which are exported. This will be very helpful to the finishers and heifer producers about whom the Deputy is concerned. We will then supplement that benefit with the aid of the national envelope so that we can be of as much help as possible to the people who did not benefit the last time. I give the Deputy an absolute commitment on that.</P>
      <P>We are in a partnership arrangement and consult fully with the social partners. The ICTSA will be included in consultations and the Deputy will be happy to know that I have already arranged a meeting next week with its national president. I spoke to him at a major meeting on the beef industry in Tullamore last night and our meeting was confirmed there.</P>

      <P>I will be bound by your ruling, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I have many questions for the Minister. Will he repeat what he said about the size of the national envelope for the first three years? Even with a total of £25 million, it will be difficult to spread it over a wide area. I make a plea not only for heifer farmers but for sheep farmers, who were badly sidelined and let down in Agenda 2000. Everything possible should be done for them. Will we have absolute discretion to spend the national envelope as we wish?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the reasoning behind the national envelope was to give member states discretion in spending their allocations of money. The down side of the scheme is that member states which are financially stronger would be in a better position than smaller member states to help their industries. We did not want too much distortion in that regard. The national envelope will increase from £8.2 million next year to £25.7 million in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking into consideration that heifer producers are not receiving nine month, ten month or 22 month payments, will the Minister make a commitment that, in distributing the slaughter premium, those producers will receive a decent amount? They are disqualified from the earlier premia received by beef, bullock and steer producers. There are not many heifer producers left, and many went out of business because they were unable to compete.</P>

      <P>As a result of CAP reform there will be a substantial increase in the amount of direct payments to farmers. It stands at 56 per cent to 57 per cent of farm income at present and will increase. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, mentioned the industry earlier. There is a major onus on the industry at producer level to produce the beef that is required to have a margin from beef production as well as from direct payments. This matter was addressed at last night's Teagasc conference on beef in Tullamore. It was encouraging that farmers were still at the conference at 9 p.m., seeking additional information about grass utilisation, etc.</P>

      <P>A new slaughter premium of £63 for adult cattle, payable on steers, young bulls, heifers and culled cows, will also apply to live exports to third countries. Having consulted the social partners, we will then use the national envelope to see whether we can supplement that payment in a number of areas which were left out in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for all commonage lands. The preparation of the framework plans is being carried out under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages. However, it is expected that the first plan will be completed within the next couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>Pending the availability of commonage framework plans, my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have put an interim national commonage framework plan in place. The interim plan involves a destocking equivalent to 30 per cent of mountain ewes for flock holders who use commonage in six counties, Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry &ndash; those counties identified as having overgrazed commonages.</P>
      <P>Commonage framework plans will determine the rate of destocking, if any, on individual commonages and the level of stocking allowed on commonages under the interim plan will be reviewed when the individual commonage framework plans are available.</P>

Every time I put down a question to the Minister, I am told the framework document will be ready in a few weeks. When will we see it?

A large number of inspectors have been trained for the framework plan in respect of individual commonages. The Deputy <Col N="1521" /> will appreciate that giving misguided messages is not the way to restore confidence to the sheep industry. It is the Department's intention to include as many people as possible. There will be sheep on the mountains, there is no question about that.

      <P>It is in the interests of overgrazed commonages that there is a destocking rate, and that is in the current interim plan. All the others will be agreed individually and planners have been trained specifically to do that. The Deputy will realise that it is difficult to deal with commonages because unless everyone complies it is hard to get agreement. There are already disputes about who has the right to use a commonage. This is a wide area. The 30 per cent plan is an interim plan and it will be respected because overgrazing is a serious matter which is good for neither farmers nor the product they are trying to produce to a high standard.</P>

      <P>My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, is currently examining objectively based grading systems that are being developed in other countries, specifically in Denmark, Germany, France and Australia. An officer of my Department along with an industry delegation visited Denmark in August 1998 to examine the operation of the BCC-2 system there. Arrangements are at an advanced stage to set up a trial in an Irish beef plant to evaluate three of the available systems &ndash;  the Danish BCC-2 system, the German VBS 2000 system and the Australian VIA scan system. The trial will be conducted during the summer months and will involve an initial calibration of the systems followed by an evaluation phase.</P>
      <P>The intention is to examine the applicability of objective systems under Irish conditions. The performance of the machines will be assessed by experts from my Department and the EU Commission. The information obtained will be pooled with the data available from other member states which should contribute to getting a mechanically based system adopted in the EU as soon as possible. None of the mechanical grading systems being evaluated has yet been granted approval by the European Commission.</P>

The Minister of State's reply was long-winded and I want to know why there will be a huge number of evaluations. Why is Ireland different from countries which are used to utilising the system?

      <P>I am aware of the dissatisfaction of producers. I am also aware of the importance of grading and classification systems, particularly if we are to regain our share in the markets to which I referred in reply to an earlier question. A move towards flat rate selling took place in recent weeks, but this has been reversed in light of the downturn in the market. When the economy is buoyant there is usually a tendency to move towards flat rate selling, which is upsetting the market. A percentage of our product is going to Third World markets and we must improve on that.</P>
      <P>Two machines &ndash; one Australian, the other Danish &ndash; will be placed in two factories in the south-east later in the year. They may already be in place. I invite Deputy Penrose to accompany me on a visit to the two plants involved to see them in action. I intend to travel to Denmark to see a machine in operation. However, there is no scientific evaluation available at present and the company concerned is not supported by the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise we must improve the system and satisfy producers, otherwise we will continue to have a &ldquo;you and us&rdquo; situation between factories and producers. This has created much dissatisfaction on all sides and it has bedevilled the beef industry more than anything else during the past five to ten years because of the uncertainty in <Col N="1524" /> respect of grading. Farmers, by and large, are genuine people but they distrust the plants and factories and for that reason we must put in place a more scientific evaluation system. I will do everything possible to ensure a system is put in place which will satisfy everyone's needs.</P>

If he has it to hand, perhaps the Minister of State could provide the House with information on the proposed cost of mechanical graders. I understand they are expensive. As part of an overall beef plan, is it vitally important that we transfer to this system? In my view, flat rate selling should be outlawed by legislation because it helps no one. However, it is equally important that grading is seen to be fair. Will grant aid be made available to meat processors and those who invest in mechanical graders?</P>

I cannot state whether the new machines are good, bad or indifferent, but we want to remove the possibility of human error from beef grading and put in place a satisfactory system. Everyone in the industry in this country has a great deal to gain from abandoning the old system.</P>
      <P>Farmers claim they are being done down. That is far from true, but it is the reality. If we move away from that mindset, our beef industry will be a model for Europe and we will be able to tap into and sell produce on the markets to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <P>To date, 40,869 farmers from a total of 147,800 have been approved for REPS which equates to 27.65 per cent. All applications submitted under the scheme are subject to a desk check. There are two main types of on-farm compliance control checks on farmers participating in REPS. Each year 50 per cent of all participants who have completed their first year in the scheme are selected for an on-farm compliance check to ensure applicants have carried out the work specified in their agri-environmental plans and are farming in accordance the agri-environmental specifications. Payment cannot proceed until the compliance inspection has been completed.</P>

The rural environment protection scheme is one of the most successful ever run by the Department. It has been hugely beneficial to farmers, the environment and Ireland's green image. The scheme has been particularly helpful in terms of re-growing hedges and preserving wildlife habitats.</P>
      <P>I will now provide the Deputy with some information in respect of the years 1995, 1996 and 1997. There were 195 pre-payment inspections in 1995, 1,163 in 1996 and 1,204 in 1997. There were 5,285 compliance inspections in 1995 and 9,563 in 1996. I do not have the figures for 1998 and 1999. The provisions of the scheme are extremely strict and severe penalties are imposed on people who have directly neglected to adhere to them. The Deputy will be aware, the scheme is part of a policy to promote a reduced use of nitrogen and potash. It has been of great direct benefit not only to farms but also to our rivers and waterways.</P>

A farmer who did not cut back a hedge an extra six inches because he could not get near it with a machine due to bad weather was penalised by a deduction of 10 per cent from his payment. Deputy Johnny Brady, who knows about this case, is nodding his head in agreement. That deduction was extremely unfair. Consultation with the staff in offices should be realistic in respect of applications made and inspections carried out.

      <P>I would be surprised if the farmer's payment was deducted on that basis alone. There is a fair appeals system. It is understood by Department officials that if land is wet a farmer cannot get in with a machine to do the work and that rather than destroying more land such hedge growth of six inches would not make much difference. If the Deputy, and Deputy Brady, gives me details of the case I will examine how the appeals body dealt with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State that this was one of the best schemes ever introduced. The Minister of State mentioned that £175 million has been made available for the scheme this year. He must remember the farmers' contribution to achieve the targets set out in the REPS is also nearly that amount. It is not a case of just handing out money to every farmer in the country. The resources used by farmers almost amount to that handed out.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned about dropping the three year derogration. There has been talk about the steady increase in the numbers in the scheme each year, but the number is unlikely to increase to 50,000 because of what is happening. Small farmers will not have the investment ability to build slatted houses before they join the scheme. I appeal to the two Ministers of State present to try to get that derogation reduced from three years to two years or to one year.</P>

This <Col N="1527" /> year 40,000 farmers are participating in it compared to 30,000 last year.

Regarding the hedgerow protection aspect of REPS, will he ensure that planners relax their insistence that inside hedges, which do not affect anyone other than the farmers who wish to retain them, should be cut? Will he take account of the wishes of farmers who do not want inside hedges cut. Some of these hedges have not been cut for decades. It is required under REPS that hedges be cut every five years.  Will the Minister of State ask planners to relax that requirement given the environmental criteria under which REPS operates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to control expenditure in this and every other type of election. We all accept that. People with deep pockets are not necessarily automatically elected, either to local authorities or to Dáil Éireann. However, when people with deep pockets spend, they put pressure on other candidates. In fact, the downward spiral has become a reality in both local and national elections in recent years because some people have had more funding than electoral appeal. They tried to buy themselves into the Dáil and local authorities.</P>
      <P>If it were practical I would strongly support a cap on all expenditure. As both the Minister and the Minister of State have said, the problem in local government elections is that it is difficult in practical terms to effectively put in place and police a system of local expenditure capping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, alternative approaches to achieving the same objective. Certain types of expenditure are totally wasteful, cancel each other out and mean nothing other than transferring money from one pocket to another. What I have in mind is the extraordinary practice by candidates that has grown up in recent times, particularly in local elections, of buying expensive advertising space in newspapers. That is totally wasteful because when a newspaper's sales department gets a booking for a half page advertisement from one candidate, it rings every other candidate and pressure is applied. I cannot understand the logic of banning advertising from local radio and television yet still allowing it in the print media. In the interests of sanity as well as this mythical level playing pitch, we should ban it in <Col N="1530" /> all cases. If that was done, a significant amount of expenditure would be taken out of the equation.</P>
    <P>Of all election expenditure, the large 8 x 4 ft. posters one sees in some places are the most wasteful. It is an absolute delusion that anybody votes a particular way because of such posters which I would seek to ban.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate has raised its head on several occasions in the debate. I disagree fundamentally with the suggestion that we should abolish it. Anybody who makes such a suggestion clearly has not looked at some of the fairly rich literature that is available on how organisations should link different layers into each other. It is almost 20 years since the idea of communication having inter-links between different levels in an organisation was proposed, and it still makes eminent good sense.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate is a powerful way of keeping national politicians in contact with what is happening on the ground. Local government and national politics will be diminished if the dual mandate is simply wiped out because of some ideological or dogmatic view. There is certainly an argument for debating how time is used. I am a member of Greystones Town Commissioners and I hope I will be after the 11 June elections. It is the humblest form of local authority. I happen to be one of the people responsible for the town commissioners being established. I am also a member of the county council. My time on both bodies is well spent in terms of the service I can give to my constituents.</P>
    <P>Looking through the excellent book, <i>Nealon's Guide to the 28th Dáil &amp; Seanad: Election '97</i>, I find that most politicians in the Oireachtas &ndash; not just in this generation but over the last few generations &ndash; have been trained and developed their political skills, such as they are, in local government. It would be a fundamental error to abolish the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>I made it clear to the Minister that I will do everything in my power, both within my own parliamentary party and in the House, to prevent the abolition of what I regard as a valuable part of democracy. If people do not like a candidate, whether for the Dáil or Seanad elections, they have the right to make a decision. It is nothing short of extraordinary when one considers that a mass murderer who has served his or her time, or a fraudster of monumental proportions who has not been caught, can run for election to a local authority. In fact, anybody who is guilty of any capital offence and who has served their time &ndash; or, in fact, who may not even have served their time &ndash; can run for election under the current local government election rules. The only people who will be refused the right to put their names before the people are Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. That says much about our image and how we view ourselves.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate serves a considerable purpose. There is an interesting array of views on the issue in the House. Deputy Killeen made a very <Col N="1531" /> sensible contribution earlier and he spoke briefly about electronic voting. We operate proportional representation, particularly at local government level, in a very imperfect way. For example, at the last election to Greystones Town Commissioners, one candidate was elected by a portion of a vote. In several other local wards around County Wicklow people were elected by margins of one or two votes, after the imperfect system of transferring surpluses. I compliment the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials on the electronic voting experiment, to which I look forward. It will allow us to observe PR. It will be interesting to see if there is a difference between the declared result and the experimental one. If so, how will we deal with that? That issue aside, the use of PR is an extraordinarily subtle and well understood electoral system. The people have shown they have a particular affinity for it. Maybe that has something to do with our national character. It has stood the test of time since it was introduced in local government in 1919. I am putting a marker down, however, about the dual mandate.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Ring who made some pertinent comments about the role of councillors and council management.

The stories we are getting from that side of the House indicate that only Deputy Healy-Rae stood between local government reform and the present system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Roche and Deputy Healy-Rae will lead the campaign to keep councillors in the Dáil, and <i>vice versa</i>. Given our present electoral system, the dual mandate will not disappear. Whether we like it or not, when a voter has to vote from numbers one to ten when choosing preferences, national politicians will always like to keep their fingers in the local pie. We will not have any real, radical or true local government reform until we have electoral reform. We can debate until the cows come home what type of new electoral system to go for, but as long as we retain our multi seat proportional representation system, which has been in operation for the past 70 years, it will be impossible to reform local and national government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government is hugely important to every citizen. There is a little cynicism from time to time about the role of the councillor, but on a daily basis local government members and man<Col N="1532" /> agement impact to a greater degree on ordinary people than we do. I am sure that on 11 June a sizable majority of people will exercise their right to vote at town commissioner, urban district council and county council levels. We are debating the expenditure provisions for these elections and the new controls the Minister is introducing.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to defend a system which provides that a candidate can only expend a certain amount of money to be elected to the Dáil while there is no such limit at local authority level. Perhaps the Minister has an explanation, but at best that explanation will be only reasonably rational, as it is difficult to justify a limit for more expensive national election campaigns when there is no limit for local elections. I concur with those who have said that money will not elect a candidate, but if there are to be controls for Dáil elections it is quite bizarre that there are none at town commission, urban district council or county council election levels. I welcome the provision that ensures candidates must declare reasonably significant donations, and I have no difficulty with local election candidates having to provide lists of election expenditure. However, it is difficult to accept that while we are going that far we are not imposing a limit.</P>
    <P> The debate about election costs is one reason people are unwilling to go forward for election. It is no secret that most political parties had some difficulty in getting new young candidates for the local elections. These elections should present huge opportunities to new candidates, but many areas no longer have a rush of people like those who came forward in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The National Youth Council survey published this week suggests there will be very few young people standing as candidates or voting. There seems to be very little interest among young people in the local elections, and that is very damaging to politics in the long-term. One can say that young people are not interested in politics but that as they grow older and take on responsibilities they take a greater interest in the affairs of the nation. However, there is more cynicism about politics than usual, and the lack of interest in politics among young people goes hand in hand with that. That does not augur well for the strengthening of democracy.</P>
    <P>On the whole, councillors across the political divide have given this country great service. However, in our typically Irish way of doing business through the back door, we do not pay councillors salaries but try to reward them with expenses instead. Local authority members should be paid a fixed salary. We could debate the amount another time, but these people give a huge amount of time to their communities and parties. It is wrong that there is not a system to compensate them for the huge expenses they can incur. It does no good for the media to report how much councillors get in expenses or the number of councillors going to various conferences. We should have a proper, open system of funding councillors, as that might make the career of a <Col N="1533" /> councillor more attractive than it seems to be at present. Unless we get good people involved in local politics there will not be a natural flow into national politics.</P>
    <P>The Minister has hinted for 12 to 18 months at bringing forward meaningful local government reform. However, as Deputy Roche said earlier, we call for strengthened powers of local government when in Opposition, but we lose that desire when in Government. Perhaps the centralised view of politics means that the Government wishes to keep all the power in Leinster House. There are huge opportunities for decentralising powers to local authorities, but we do not seem to have the political courage or will to decentralise because giving those authorities real powers and responsibilities means that councillors' workloads will be such that Oireachtas Members will not be able to serve at both levels. While we have the present electoral system, which puts such huge emphasis on constituency work and local politics rather than national issues, it will be difficult to effect the kind of changes that are desirable.</P>
    <P>The proposals for electronic voting are welcome. There is a negative side to every innovation, and people may come to regret the passing of 24-hour counts, but electronic voting is a much better system mathematically. It is better that people know their fate within half an hour or an hour of the polls closing; the parties or wakes can then be held on the night of the election rather than the following day. It can be done with the local mayor or with the President in the United States, and I am sure we can do it. The proportional representation system obviously adds a confusing dimension, but I hope the tests carried out in this election show we can use this modern, worthwhile system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, though I seriously question why we are not putting more limits in place. I look forward to a much broader debate on local government, and hope the Minister lives up to his hints. If we are to have real local government reform then Members must be more willing to lose powers and local seats than we have been heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Bill dealing with local authority reform about which the Minister has been speaking for some time, has not been introduced in time for the forthcoming elections. It would have given great impetus to a debate on such a Bill, and it seems highly imprudent to have legislation relating to these elections put off until the next session or until next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not criticise the present Minister any more than I criticised his predecessors. Unlike a previous speaker, I say the same in Government as in Opposition. I was very critical five years ago when our then Whip introduced a Bill on Dáil reform. We were promised all sorts of improvements at Question Time, in voting procedures and other issues. Nothing happened. The Minister also indicated his intention to carry out considerable reform in the Dáil and local authorities. <Col N="1534" /> As yet, we have not seen any. Local authorities celebrate their centenary this month and there is a need for considerable reform.</P>
    <P>I asked a number of questions yesterday about certain aspects of local authority management. The Minister agreed that changes are needed because no change has been made in the management of local authorities for at least 70 years. It is disheartening for public representatives to have to work in an outdated system. In any walk of life, it is necessary to keep up with the times, but I see no effort being made to do this in the management of local government where there is great resistance to change.</P>
    <P>Power should be given back to the elected representatives of the people. I have been a member of local authorities for 32 years and I have a fair knowledge of the workings of county and urban councils and of the Oireachtas. When I see how power is concentrated in the hands of a few people who are not elected by anyone, I wonder if we politicians have any courage or initiative. The freedom for which an earlier generation fought so hard has been handed to people who appear to have to answer to no one.</P>
    <P>The County Management Act, 1942, gives a disproportionate amount of power to approximately 30 people &ndash; county and city managers &ndash; who are not elected. I have never seen one of them dismissed. Public representatives must stand for election and we can be dismissed from office by our electorate, but county and city managers are a law unto themselves. Recent revelations made in a building in another part of the city show one of the 30 people of whom I speak to have been involved in considerable fraud of just the sort referred to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to ensure candidates do not receive large sums of money to spend on election campaigns and that those who make such donations do not later demand repayment in the form of political favours. It is a small attempt to prevent corruption at local authority level, but what is to prevent the corruption of people who are in charge of the allocation of jobs, houses and the granting of planning permission? Planning is an important and vexed issue and one where there is much scope for abuse. What strictures have we over the people to whom I have referred? Have we introduced legislation to clip their wings or curtail their activities? Can anyone tell me that only one of the 30 is corrupt? Is it not possible that a large number of people in middle management in our local authorities might need to be scrutinised closely? What are we doing to scrutinise the people who have the real power? </P>
    <P>My experience in Government has taught me that Cabinets have a certain degree of power. A strong and ruthless Taoiseach may have absolute power. Some Cabinets may contain two or three strong members. A strong Minister for Finance may have one or two cronies to whom he allocates money; a Minister for the Environment and Local Government may be lucky enough to be one of them. Real power is confined to a very few <Col N="1535" /> people. This Bill is what Vincent Browne might call a tremor in a teacup. Its effect will be very slight because we are not dealing with the kernel of the issue. Some of the people involved have friends in high places or who are in trouble and they like to diminish the gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>Public representatives, in the Oireachtas or in local government, do not have power. There is no point in introducing legislation which does not relate to the people who have real power. There may have been abuses of the planning system by public representatives in Dublin, but such abuse did not occur widely, if at all, throughout the rest of the country. What occurred in Dublin amounted to corruption or criminal activity. The tribunals will determine the extent of it and bring those responsible to justice.</P>
    <P>Who is running our local authorities and why do public representatives not have more say in what is going on? To take power into their own hands, elected representatives are obliged to bring in section 4 motions &ndash; a difficult and cumbersome procedure and one which councillors do not like because it can lead to abuse.</P>
    <P>We must change our system of public accountability. We might follow the American system under which elected office holders have real power and responsibility. We are elected, but we do not have responsibility. In a democratic system, the majority should rule and those who are elected should have the power to decide what should be done and do it. We do not have such a system. My recommendations should also apply to all local authority subsidiary bodies, including health boards and vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Multi-seat constituencies &ndash; for Dáil Éireann and local authorities &ndash; should be abolished. Single seat constituencies &ndash; whether with the straight or single transferable vote &ndash; would put an end to bickering within parties. Candidates have gone to extraordinary lengths to denigrate their running mates &ndash; one even with a car. Much political energy and talent is wasted in competing with party colleagues. We have all experienced this phenomenon and I am glad I overcame it and will not experience it again. It does not serve the country well. The people should have the system, whether it be national or local, to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom díriú ar chomóradh chéad bhliain an chéad Chomhairle. Tharla an chéad chruinniú an mhí seo i 1899. Nuair a smaoinítear ar cén fáth ar tógadh isteach na comhairlí sin agus ar an bpolasaí a bhí ag na Coimeadaigh i Sasana ag an am agus ar an dul chun cinn sa chéad bhliain atá imithe thart ó shin <Col N="1536" /> is féidir linn a rá go bhfuil an daonlathas tógtha chun cinn againn sa tír seo. Tá ár mbuíochas tuillte ag na Comhairlí Chontae go bhfuil an córas sin ann le céad bliain anuas.</P>
      <P>When the Conservative Party in England introduced the Local Government Bill in 1898, leading to the first meeting of the councils in 1899, it was not out of the goodness of its heart but part of a policy to kill Home Rule with kindness. The first part of the policy worked in so far as local government was successful but the second did not. All it did, in trying to solve the land question, was encourage the Irish people to continue the fight for full democracy and full representation in their own parliament. A number of the leading Members of the first Dáil had been members of local councils. W. T. Cosgrave who went on to become Taoiseach had been an active member of Dublin Corporation. It marked the beginning of democracy in a real sense. People were challenged to give a lifelong commitment &ndash; always unpaid &ndash; to serve their local community.</P>
      <P>The sense of excitement evident 100 years ago has been replaced by cynicism, criticism and opposition. For the first time in eight years we are facing local elections in which no one under the age of 26 has voted. They probably do not know what role local authorities play. Candidates will have to prove that they are of high standard, most sincere and of great integrity. This will make it difficult to encourage people to enter politics. It should be made easier, not more difficult. In recent times rumours, innuendo, scandals and accusations have led people to decide that politics is not the most honourable of professions.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a logical extension of the legislation that refers to the Dáil. That legislation is practically inoperable and in the next election will interfere with voluntary activity in campaigns where the amounts spent will have to be disclosed. It insists on disclosure of amounts received by a candidate over £500. Although welcome and justified, it amounts to an invasion of privacy where a candidate has to declare that their husband or wife has made a donation.</P>
      <P>While this Bill insists on disclosure, it does not limit expenditure. I understand the reasons for this and that we are talking about thousands, not hundreds, of candidates in constituencies of different size. Does it mean, however, that expenditure will be outlandish? I have seen election brochures that resemble <i>Hello</i> magazine rather than the typical election leaflet. Will the focus be on razzmatazz with cars and vans emblazoned in full colour rather than on the real issues? I hope the information supplied by candidates after the elections will be used well to ascertain how much was spent and whether it was used to the benefit of the political and electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6, which deals with election expenses, requires candidates to list the moneys spent in opposing, directly or indirectly, the interests of a political party or candidate. While one comes across instances of negative canvassing, one does not often come across instances of negative <Col N="1537" /> advertising. It is never blatant. The message is often subliminal &ndash;&ldquo;I am young, new and honest&rdquo;; the implication being that everybody else on the ticket is old and dishonest and perhaps should be shafted.</P>
    <P>I question the use of the perfect family photograph of the candidate, his wife and beautiful children. Is this to promote the candidate or to draw attention to another candidate who may not be in the same situation? In looking at ethics it might be more appropriate to examine the type of message sent rather than the cost.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the cost of an opinion poll taken within 60 days of an election must be noted. Opinion polls should not be allowed within 60 days of an election. While they may be of interest to candidates, they are not beneficial to the public.</P>
    <P>If somebody writes good things about a candidate in a newspaper or magazine, they will not be allowed to put a cost on it. What about negative reporting where a journalist decides to put a twist on a candidate's candidacy?</P>
    <P>The Bill states that if a candidate recycles posters used in a previous election, they do not have to be declared a second time. This is an environmentally-friendly measure and gives ample opportunity to reuse old posters, particularly those used in the Presidential campaign which are lying in garages throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The serious penalties for non-disclosure will make the Bill effective. An unsuccessful candidate who fails to make a disclosure within 56 days of an election will be disqualified from membership in the event of a vacancy arising. Successful candidates may be suspended or disqualified.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities must declare their interests and property. This is necessary. The same should apply to officials. They should have to adhere to a strong ethical code. Each candidate, each political party and each authority should adopt their own code of ethics to show that we are people of integrity.</P>
    <P>On this occasion the chairpersons of Oireachtas committees will be allowed to stand for election. Section 24 provides for this. Like all Oireachtas Members, they will be disbarred, however, from taking on the role of chairperson, mayor or lord mayor. Given that the dual mandate is being removed for the next election, it is unfortunate that they will not be allowed to hold each position.</P>
    <P>Unlike many of my colleagues, I welcome the end of the dual mandate. I believe, as an elected representative in Dáil Éireann, our primary duty is to be national legislators. It is then our responsibility, each of us individually, to keep in touch with our constituents on a regular basis working for them on all the local issues. That does not mean we need to be members of councils to do so. We need to broaden the basis of representation at local level so that we have a full bank of TDs, Senators and councillors working for the interests of our constituents at all levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> The one thing I am nervous about in section 25 on recording and counting of electronic voting is that there might be job losses among our expert tallymen, all of whom work voluntarily. That is part of the system in Irish politics and the tallymen are part of our culture. I would hate to see them being removed from office, as it were, because electronic voting has taken over. I recognise, it would be in everyone's interest to have the result more quickly. This Bill is a necessary step forward and because of ethics and standards. I regret it has been necessary to introduce it, but recognise it is needed. Mar sin fáiltím roimh an mBille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hanafin for sharing her time. The reason I welcome the Bill is that it gives me an opportunity to speak on local government reform in particular. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and a report on local government reform has been submitted by members of the committee. It is an area which has been neglected over the years, and that has been alluded to by Members on both sides of the House. Centralised government and placing the power structures in the hands of a few individuals should be discouraged at all times.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about bringing democracy to the people and <i>vice versa</i>, a complete overhaul of the present structures of local government is essential. Deputy Deasy alluded to the 1944 managerial Act. I am very concerned that the running of counties and cities is in the hands of a few people who are not answerable on a regular basis to the public or to public representatives who have been elected to that body. People will argue that county councillors, corporation members and urban and town commissioners have a role to play and that they can implement policy. However, when one analyses local government, one will realise it is the county manager and a few officials in higher managerial sections who run local authorities. That is completely unacceptable and negates the essence of democracy. If we are serious about local government reform, we must challenge that and take the power from those who are unelected and hand it back to those who are.</P>
      <P>Despite all its ills, America has one great strength in that it prides itself on democracy. At every level, even at community council level, those who are elected make the decisions, handle the money and are accountable to the people at the next election. It is time we looked at that issue as we face the next millennium and after 100 years of local government. Local government has served this country well since its inception, but there is much room for improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a duty as public representatives at national and local levels to ensure politics is promoted in all sectors of society and that those who hold public office are people of integrity and honesty. The reason this Bill is before the House is that people are concerned at the way politicians <Col N="1539" /> are pursuing their careers and at how they fund their campaigns and the fact they may be compromised at some point in the future by a donation from an individual. The majority of people who stand for public office, from the town commission to Dáil Éireann, have a genuine sense of public duty. They are there to serve the people in their community.</P>
    <P>We are bringing forward this legislation for all the wrong reasons, that is, the negative vibes in society. Representatives in this House have a strong duty, as do reporters. Journalists must report in a fair manner and not in the sensational way which has become evident in Irish reportage. I am concerned that is sending all the wrong signals.</P>
    <P>If we look at the turnout for local and general elections, statistics would suggest it is slipping. We must ask why people are not as interested in politics now as they were at the start of the century. One could argue they were refused the right to vote for so long but I believe there is a deeper problem which must be tackled. Young people, in particular, are not interested in exercising their franchise. It is an issue at which we must look seriously in view of the demographic trends in our society. We have a large young population so a huge section of our community will be unrepresented at local authority level on 11 June if they do not vote.</P>
    <P>I would defend the right of a person to decide not to vote as much as I would the right to vote. However, people should be encouraged to exercise their right so that those who are elected can identify the issues and come to grips with what people are thinking. If only 50 per cent cast their vote, we face a huge problem which we must seriously address. We talk about the problems with the register of electors but they are administrative. There is a deep and underlying trend which will continue unless politicians at all levels stand up and have the honesty to say they can or cannot do something or that they have or do not have the power to do something. The reason people are not voting is that they look at politicians and say they cannot make an impact. That is something about which we must be very concerned.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, some Members of the Houses wanted the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to set up an independent review group to decide on grant applications. I know as much about my constituency as any expert advisory group. I believe I am entitled to advise the Minister on deserving and worthy cases because I was elected by the people of Cork North-Central. My colleagues in the constituency could do likewise.</P>
    <P>We are beginning to row back and hand powers to quangos. Every country which moved in that direction is now rowing back. We need look only at Britain which had quangos for everything. It realised its folly and is handing the power back <Col N="1540" /> to the people, something which will continue. We have a long way to go and we must act soon before local government and national government represent only a small proportion of the people.</P>
    <P>On the dual mandate, I am not a member of a local authority but intend to stand for election. I will defend the dual mandate as long as we have the present electoral system of multi-seat constituencies and more than one party colleague within a constituency. It is an issue at which we will have to look. If we are serious about giving more time to national issues and devolving powers back to local authorities, we will have to look at how we elect the national Parliament as well. We will have to look at the single transferable vote, proportional representation and single seat constituencies. That would allow TDs elected in such constituencies to concentrate solely on national issues and would give them the time and space to deal with constituents' problems without having to look over their shoulders to see if a colleague attended the same funeral they attended.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will discourage some people and encourage others to become involved in politics and make them realise that most people involved in this noble profession are honest, decent and hardworking. I will defend politicians everywhere I go.</P>

      <P>As a member of a local authority for the past 32 years and a Member of this House for the past 18 years, I know only too well that local government and national Government go hand in hand. This year marks the centenary of local government in Ireland. I dislike the trend displayed over generations to whittle away the powers of democratically elected representatives of local councils. Local government powers should be established through local government structures. It is a sad day for this country when the powers of local government are being fettered and local government is being turned into a mere talking shop.</P>
      <P>Local government was established 100 years ago to build up this country and I cannot understand why more powers cannot be devolved to it. I served on a local authority agriculture committee which had the power to appoint temporary agricultural instructors and home economics advisers throughout the county. I saw the powers of such committees being eroded to the point where appointments could only be made by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who has held a dual mandate for the past 18 years, in this House and on Cork County Council, and as the longest serving member of that council, I am well aware of the value <Col N="1541" /> of local government representatives being elected to the national Parliament and of TDs holding positions on local authorities. I do not want to see the powers of local councillors being completely eroded and Members of this House not having an opportunity to express their views in local councils. I do not believe it places an additional burden on a Member of this House to hold a dual mandate. However, I see difficulties arising where Oireachtas Members hold other positions outside politics. They find it very difficult to compete with those Members for whom public representation is their only way of life.</P>
    <P>A public representative is a public representative, whether a Member of this House or of Cork, Donegal or Kilkenny county councils. The only people clamouring for change at present are the well-heeled and articulate who hold jobs and have incomes outside politics. They come in here very occasionally to address the House and then go to their respective jobs in the city and elsewhere. I do not want that to happen with local government. The Minister of State had the privilege of serving on a local corporation with distinction while he was a Member of this House. His record in Cork Corporation and in this House is unblemished. I want to kill the myth that there is no room for national political representatives to be elected to local councils. There is a danger that local government will fall into an abyss and that people who are democratically elected will have no effective powers.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a timely one. There was not much sense in having disclosure of general election expenditure if similar disclosures were not put in place for local government elections. The Minister of State outlined some reasonable suggestions in this regard. There are moves afoot to confer the title of mayor on urban council chairpersons. Chairpersons of county councils should also be known as mayors. That is a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>County managers hold the real power in local government. More powers must be devolved to democratically elected county councillors throughout the country. They are the hallmark of success as far as democracy is concerned. Democracy was introduced for the first time in this country 100 years ago when people were allowed to elect their own representatives to county councils. National government was introduced some 20 years later. Local government is the forerunner of the democratic principles we have now enshrined in this House. Let us hope they will be preserved and nurtured as the years go by.</P>
    <P>I am very dubious about the decision to disbar an Oireachtas representative from holding a dual mandate. That position must be changed. I see no reason Members of the Oireachtas who devote their time to fighting for their constituents' rights should be denied the right to become chairpersons of their respective county councils if their constituents elect them to such positions. I would not support placing an impediment in their way in any circumstances. I am delighted that when <Col N="1542" /> representations were made to the Minister by Deputy Healy-Rae, a renowned colleague of mine, the Minister quickly changed the rules concerning chairmen of Oireachtas committees who are now, rightly, entitled to run for local authority election. Chairmen should also be entitled to be elected to the chair of their respective councils if the members of the councils see fit to do so.</P>
    <P>It is with a sense of pride and privilege that I have served my people in Cork South West for 32 years on Cork County Council, to which I am seeking re-election, and for 18 years in this House. It was no impediment for me to serve in both establishments and I look forward to the day when other people who listen to what I have said will think twice before removing the dual mandate from democratically elected representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the service of my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, the father of our party. I think I am the baby of the party so both extremes are represented in the debate.</P>
      <P>We are known by our actions &ndash; words are not enough. After two years in office the Government has again missed the boat. The Minister made an order in December 1997 postponing the local elections until June 1999. We were promised comprehensive proposals for reform. These reforms should have been widely debated, passed into law and in force in time for the local elections in June. There was plenty of time to do this, but the Government failed and local government will be poorer as a result. It is a pity there has not been wide-ranging debate or reforms passed through legislation in the House in the lead up to the local elections. Introducing such reform would have made local government far more meaningful in the new millennium. The failure to do so shows the Government and the Fianna Fáil party places local government very low in importance in terms of their agenda. It is an insult to past and current local representatives that the Government decided not to debate the badly needed reforms properly and on time. The elections will take place in June and the subsequent elections will take place, I hope, five years afterwards. In the meantime legislation has been put on the long finger.</P>
      <P>We have also been promised a referendum to give constitutional recognition to local government, which I believe will be held on the same day as the local and European elections. However, time is moving on and I understand the necessary legislation should be passed by the Dáil by 22 May. Perhaps I am incorrect in this, but I say it in the context of press releases issued by the Minister some time ago. If I am correct, then the legislation will have to be rushed through. A constitutional amendment is a most important event and should be preceded by widespread debate. People do not seem to be aware of what is happening in this regard and I ask the Minister to clarify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is another fudge. There is no provision in it for the disclosure of money given to election <Col N="1543" /> candidates, elected members or unelected officials at times other than at election time. Have we learned anything over the past 12 months? Surely we should have some provision in the legislation for disclosure of money received by a person in a brown paper bag, through e-commerce or in some other way. Why is such provision not included in the legislation given that Deputies must disclose such donations? Why is Fianna Fáil failing to close these loopholes? It is no wonder that there is apathy towards politics.</P>
    <P>Donations of more than £500 must be disclosed. What happens in the case of a person who receives six or 60 donations of £500 from different people? There is not a limit in this regard, thereby creating another loophole. Also, a cap on spending is not provided. Why is no cap applied to local authority candidates given that a cap on expenditure applies to Deputies? A series of milk and water reasons have been given with reference to the scale and cost of policing such a provision. However, everybody would adhere to a cap on spending if provision for random checks was included in the legislation. I fear the Government may also lift the cap on expenditure in general elections. It is a tale of loopholes, indecision and failure. By not having a cap on spending candidates will be encouraged to compete with each other in terms of spending, with bigger and glossier posters, etc.</P>
    <P>Chairpersons of Oireachtas committees are becoming increasingly important and relevant, perhaps even more relevant than this Chamber. We note that representatives of the media are not present for this debate, whereas there is nearly always a representative present in committees. Recently, a colleague said he spent hours debating a certain Bill, but that not one word appeared in the print or other media. Yet, if a Member of the Oireachtas from either side put one toe wrong, it would be written about in glorious multi-colour on the front page of the national newspapers. All the work, time and debate that takes place here gets very little coverage unless one says something totally outlandish or off the wall.</P>
    <P>Chairpersons of Oireachtas committees receive a generous payment and are expected to lead a detailed and rather heavy work programme. However, the Minister is taking a step backwards in removing the disqualification of Chairs of Oireachtas committees from membership of local authorities. I disagree with my esteemed colleague in this regard.</P>

      <P>Of course I do not, and I bow to Deputy Sheehan's wide experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the reason is that local authority power rests with the management rather than the members. If members of local authorities had the powers and were accountable they would possibly <Col N="1544" /> chose to serve either in this House or on a local authority. However, members of local authorities do not have the power, although they get the blame when something goes wrong. Deputies are also called upon to provide answers by various interest groups and representative associations when something goes wrong at local authority level. It is very seldom that one sees the management of local authorities present in such circumstances. I am aware of this following the pylon issue in Cobh, something of which the Minister is also aware, when the politicians were called upon to debate the issue with the residents. We were all being blamed for what was proposed while we had no say in the matter. I commend the members of Cork County Council for taking the very unusual and drastic step of rescinding planning permission. People were saying there was no democracy and the situation was very serious. Let us hope the ESB takes account of the democratic wishes of the people and the members of the county council and forgets about the pylons.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been forced to climb down on the issue of chairpersons of Oireachtas committees running for election to local authorities. He may even abandon his proposal to abolish the dual mandate. These matters are relevant to the powers of local authorities, an issue we cannot debate because proposals have not been placed before us.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that local authorities have existed for 100 years. Instead of marking the occasion by broad debate, the Government has displayed grave indecision and delay and has only offered this meaningless Bill.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are very important in the everyday lives of our people, as they make decisions on roads, housing, water, sewerage, planning, development, environmental protection, recreation, amenities, emergency services, grants, courthouses, libraries, harbours, piers, quays, the arts, beach cleaning, derelict sites, by-laws, etc. We need to encourage people to stand for local elections. I already mentioned the democratic deficit which must be addressed soon. The electronic experiment is a good idea.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the disclosure of expenditure for the forthcoming local elections. I pay tribute to all current and former members of local authorities who serve and have served their authorities, ward areas and constituents well. It is important we acknowledge that there are committed, dedicated and enthusiastic people who have participated in local government. Some entered to use it as a stepping stone, others left for one reason or another while others have remained in local government because that is their desire. It is important we recognise that <Col N="1545" /> people have become involved in local government for different reasons. Deputy Sheehan, who has a long and honourable record in local government, recognises that during his time people on councils have come and gone because of certain issues. We must acknowledge that ordinary people have been involved in local government. I have seen lobby groups such as ACRA and others play an important role because of the position they adopted on certain topics. As a member of Dublin City Council, I acknowledge the input and commitment of the officials of Dublin Corporation, many of whom I have dealt with.</P>
      <P>I stood for election to local government in 1985 when I had the fire in my belly to try to achieve some of my goals at local level. I then attempted to do so at national level, and I acknowledge that the fact I was a public representative at local level and my consequent experience, participation and success or otherwise assisted me in becoming a Member of Dáil Éireann, in preparing for issues I wished to tackle at national level and in achieving what I wanted.</P>
      <P>I have mixed views, as do many contributors, on the content of the Bill. Most of us would like to see transparency through disclosure of expenditure to a certain extent but not a situation where the scales tip too much towards disclosure of expenditure and donations received. In this regard, the Bill requires donations beyond a certain limit to be disclosed and requires each candidate to submit a one page income and expenditure statement to the local authority in whose area they were a candidate for the election. However, the Bill does not require candidates to restrict their expenditure on their campaigns. The disclosure requirement relates to the four weeks prior to the election and I am sure people will be able to avoid certain aspects of that.</P>
      <P>I support the concept of a statutory scheme for disclosure of income and expenditure during local elections but it should be broader and wider and should accommodate the bare statutory requirements. I do not want to delve into the nitty gritty of detail but the concept of bare disclosure which allows for transparency is admirable and we should seek to achieve that. It has been said that there are too many candidates to maintain a limit on their expenditure. I understand there are corporation, county council, urban district council and town commissioner elections. I am not sure what other forms of local elections there are. That is only four groupings and one limit could be set either for them all or for each of the four categories. There would not be a wide variance between members seeking election to Dublin City Council or Cork City Council and the same is the case for county and urban district council and town commissioner elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am open-minded on the issue of the dual mandate because I would like to be able to concentrate my energies and efforts on legislation. The Bill states that, after this election, Members will not be able to seek re-election to councils nor will they be able to hold the offices of chairman <Col N="1546" /> or mayor. I am not sure that is true democracy. The roles of Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities complement each other. I have asked two friends to run with me for local government so that, if at any time in future I decide to concentrate my efforts on legislation, I will have two friends in local government. While I am open on the issue, it should be asked if, in writing this into legislation, we are saying a Member cannot work in any other capacity. Some Deputies are members of professions, such as the legal and accountancy professions. Are we saying we only want Deputies as legislators and do not want them to have any hand, act or part in any occupation other than that of Member of the Dáil? On the other hand, are we saying that Members are allowed work in other areas but are restricted on the issue of local government? I question the constitutionality of that and whether there is a democratic right to do it.</P>
    <P>In principle the Bill is trying to achieve transparency and put in place a structure, which I welcome. Unfortunately a very big project, the Dublin port tunnel project, is to run through my constituency of Dublin North-Central and through my Clontarf ward. Genuine concerns have been expressed by people in the line of the proposed route. They have been faced with bore testing outside their homes which has caused problems to some houses where cracks have appeared. There is a relatively elderly population in the vicinity, some of whom are on a restricted income, perhaps nothing more than a social welfare pension.</P>
    <P>At one point the residents were told that the tunnel would be 30 feet under their houses because it was not possible to go any deeper. They were assured that there would be no interference with their houses, but as soon as test bores commenced cracks began to appear. The residents were then told that the tunnel would be 60 feet below their houses.</P>
    <P>While the local authority has introduced the big players, including expertise from abroad, the people fighting the scheme have been given no help with professional advice and no support which may be required to obtain such advice. If the legislation is providing for balance in matters of this kind it should be fair and equal.</P>
    <P>The Minster is aware that many representations have been made by the Marino Residents Association, the Santry Residents Association, the Combined Residents and the Clontarf Residents. Huge expenditure is involved, yet these groups have been told that when decisions are made the Minister will use his discretion to see whether money will be given back. I take the opportunity to ask the Minister to review this matter along the lines of the provisions contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this legislation. It is part of the building blocks in the genuine reform of local government. I would like to have seen expenditure in local government elections capped <Col N="1547" /> for every candidate. Given the state of technology today, it is possible to ensure that each candidate, regardless of circumstances or the population of the constituency or urban area he or she would represent, accounts for the amount of money he or she spends.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in local government for the past 20 years. This legislation will impose responsibilities on every candidate seeking election. Extra powers should be given to the people we elect on 11 June. However, that is not being done. Over recent years the powers of local government have been eroded and successive Governments have been responsible for this. The legislation on managers has removed responsibility and decision making from local government. If we are asking the public representatives who will be elected next month to account for themselves and assume responsibility we should at least remove from central Government its role in local government and place it in the hands of elected public representatives. Until we do that we cannot seriously talk about reforming the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Given the state of the current system, well outlined by Deputy Sheehan, there is a need for a dual mandate because there is no protocol for local authorities to observe instances where a Member of the Oireachtas is not a member of local government. All Members know they can only serve their constituents fully if they are members of a local authority. It is essential to continuing one's life as a national politician to be involved in the local scene or to ensure, in the words of Deputy Callely, that one has friends in court. That is not acceptable and it should be changed. In the interim the Minister should focus on providing each local authority with a proper protocol and with ensuring that the rights of Oireachtas representatives are observed. At present, some constituencies and counties do not observe the right of Oireachtas representatives to certain information. The system in the neighbouring county in my constituency is one example.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to maintain a balance here. While there is nothing wrong with asking local and national politicians to be accountable, to open their homes and souls to the public and to remove their privacy by submitting all the information that is required, there is a limit. In the interests of balancing the equation there is a need for public officials to become more accountable within the system. In the UK the Prime Minister is introducing legislation to make officials more accountable. Given that so much power rests in the hands of national and local officials, it is time Departments examined the possibility of introducing legislation that would at least put them on a par with public representatives in terms of accountability. The sooner that happens the sooner there will be greater efficiencies within the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area of planning, housing and the general charge by local government over its <Col N="1548" /> affairs must be examined. If we elect people at local level to legislate and look after the affairs of any of the councils, corporations, urban councils or town commissioners they must be free to act with a full responsible role in terms of all the issues I have raised. If they act responsibly and if the officials are held to account we would strengthen the local government system.  There is a need to acknowledge the expense incurred by local government members. I have served for 20 years but there are people on Kilkenny Corporation who have served since 1950. Others have had a dual mandate during that time and they know the expense of being a public representative. There is a need within the system to take that expense to one side and to make it possible for all, regardless of means, to be in a position to serve those who elected them so that people with financial means are not in a position to give a greater service than those without. That would cater for the increasing numbers of community activists who are participating in local government.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for the Department to ensure that there are sufficient funds for the new SPCs to enable them play an active role. In my own local authority area one of the first actions in the 1999 estimates was to remove a sizeable sum of money which had been provided to ensure that the SPCs functioned efficiently. If legislation was introduced to include all these committees to make local government more accountable and inclusive we would have to provide the staff and the money to ensure that at least the new system functions. The only reason the money was removed from the estimate was that insufficient funds were provided by central government.</P>
    <P>This raises the difficult question of how local government should be funded. It is only by properly funding local government and allowing it to raise its funds locally that we will address the problem of empowerment of local public representatives. There are many innovative ways by which local authorities can raise money locally. What is lacking is the legislation to make it happen. As long as this system remains, there is a need for the dual mandate. Within that dual mandate every local public representative has a democratic right to be chairman or mayor of his or her local authority. I support the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party has worked for local government reform and decentralisation since its establishment. Whereas many people here speak automatically about local authorities, I often wonder whether they realise that a local authority is, by implication, a far less democratic structure than local government. Democracy is all the poorer because there are local authorities, what we should have is local government. In my constituency the building by Fingal County Council of a headquarters in a town park is just one of many examples of bad planning. Whereas thousands of <Col N="1549" /> people collected signatures stating that was the wrong location for such a building, that it should be built on the periphery of Swords, the capital town of Fingal, the local authority management believed otherwise. Many of the members disagreed although many others just adopted the line given to them by management. That is an example of where local government reform is needed.</P>
    <P>In Ireland too few people make too many decisions which affect the lives of many people. For real democracy to exist there must be a sense of ownership of the democratic process. By that I mean not only participation in elections but also active involvement in decision making. The Green Party believes passionately in decentralisation, but it is a concept which has been badly misrepresented. Moving from an office block in one part of the country to an office block in another part is not decentralisation. Decentralisation is the devolving of decisions from central Government to the regions, to the people who live closest to and are most affected by such decisions. Real decentralisation means the surrender of power, something which political parties other than the Green Party seem unwilling to accept.</P>
    <P>The first stage of local government is the community. Community associations and residence groups which have evolved informally need to be given formal recognition, structures and powers. Community councils need to be able to oversee the maintenance of standards in their communities and be responsible for such things as footpath repair, road signage and environmental upkeep. They should also be consulted in the planning process, as are other groups.</P>
    <P>The next level of local government should be district councils. They would be similar to the present county councils and borough corporations. District councils would have greater independence from national Government and their remit would be increased to incorporate functions of present day, largely unaccountable structures such as health boards, vocational education committees, harbour commissioners etc. Regional government would operate at a provincial or sub-provincial level, for example, a publicly elected Dublin regional authority. It would mainly be concerned with the development of regional policy and the co-ordination of local government at district council level.</P>
    <P>The role of national Government would be much reduced as a result of those reforms. Dáil Éireann would have fewer Members and there would be smaller and fewer Departments. National Government would only be concerned with the development of national laws and standards and the fulfilling of international obligations. That change would be fundamental to this House. When one considers how minute are some of the matters on the Adjournment, that shows how far we are from local government reform.</P>
    <P>The changes in the electoral system which are needed to bring about such reform would require <Col N="1550" /> the holding of much more regular local, regional and national referenda and the introduction of a petition system, which is widely used in other countries such as Switzerland.</P>
    <P>We need to initiate a policy to bring about legislation and undertake constitutional change. In that regard, I want to refer to the referendum which will be held on the same day as the local elections. The referendum Bill is likely to specify a local authority term of between four and six years. The Green Party asks that the period be fixed at five years to avoid the political manipulation which is giving politics a bad name in the context of the delayed local elections.</P>
    <P>We maintain that local communities should have the right to enact by-laws and local legislation which is appropriate to local situations. We would not tolerate interference with the electoral process and would insist that elections could not be postponed. For that reason, I insist that the five year term be put in place without the latitude to which I referred. We seek to have local government decision-making publicly accountable through elections.</P>
    <P>On the dual mandate, which has been referred to in most contributions, a person should be a representative either at national or local levels but not both. It is important to realise &ndash; people in this House do not need to be reminded &ndash; that councillors who are Deputies are assuming the persona of super councillors, councillors who have at their disposal Oireachtas envelopes and secretarial staff and who have the ear of Ministers. They are not, in effect, councillors as elected at local elections. They have an enhanced role on account of their national mandate. I would urge people to bear that in mind. I ask the Government to reflect on the manipulation of the councillors' mandate if Deputies are allowed to be members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Many members of local authorities are unable to scrutinise the amount of material and documentation they receive because of their Dáil duties, which of course include committee responsibilities. That is good for local authority management, who get their say and have their way, but it is not good for democracy or the communities we are here to serve.</P>
    <P>Unlike other democratic countries, Ireland has no constitutional provision in recognition of the need to protect local government. Neither is Ireland a signatory to the European charter on self-government, and that is shameful. Our lack of acknowledgement of local authorities and local democracy makes this debate somewhat hollow. The Green Party considers that these are commitments which must be entered into if local government is to be given the status it deserves.</P>
    <P>The funding of local government by national Government increases the dependence of local authorities and stymies independent action. Such methods of funding local government are not only politically wrong, they are also very inefficient. Taxation which is centrally collected is siphoned off by being passed through several <Col N="1551" /> Departments, thus being reduced in value before it returns to the community from where it originally came. Unfortunately, the 1977 landslide Fianna Fáil victory seems to be at the root of much of the waste involved in funding of local government by central Government. The burden should be shifted from central taxation and the money collected locally.</P>
    <P>The Green Party believes that government at all levels, in its practices and policies, should be open, transparent and accountable. Information should be freely available in a user-friendly format. That is nominally the case but many people have come to me &ndash; I am sure other Members can speak from their experience also &ndash; and said it is not easy to get information as promised in the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. It remains to be seen whether Fingal County Council headquarters, which was built in the middle of the town of Swords, resulting in congestion and problems of parking and accessibility, will be better able to provide information than had it been built, as many people wished, on the periphery of Swords town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Sargent, for sharing his time. Whenever local government is debated I am reminded of Ghandi. He was asked what he thought of western democracy and he said that he thought it would be a good idea. Similarly, local government is a good idea. Unfortunately, its practice leaves much to be desired and, in effect, Ireland has local administration and not local government. This can be seen in the powers which have been given to local government.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have the power to devise development plans and that has been used. However, these powers, which are known as reserve functions, have also been abused and this is seen in rezonings and sections 4 motions. Unfortunately, while the power given to councillors under section 4 can be used to good effect, it very seldom is. Often powers, such as those to devise an air or water quality management plan or a waste plan, are not used. They are put to one side and councillors do not exercise them. The manager comes back with a plan which is rubber-stamped by council members.</P>
      <P>Even the limited powers that are provided are not used and are very often abused. This has brought local government into disrepute. This is serious because then central Government says that it could not give these people more power because of what they have done. Ways must be sought around that because if people are treated like children, they will behave like children. We ought to give them more power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rezoning issue must be examined carefully. Often a local councillor says that he is opposed to a rezoning and goes back to the electorate to tell them this. Of course, all his colleagues have voted for the rezoning. To introduce more <Col N="1552" /> accountability councillors, together with the county or city manager, should make the decision rather than the entire council. Therefore, the individual would have to go back to the electorate, be accountable, look for votes at the next election and if they had misbehaved, they simply would not get votes. That is a way around the current problem.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that local authorities do not have money or the wherewithal to raise important taxes. I am envious of my Green Party colleagues in other countries when I see the type of local government they have. It is completely different and part of the reason for that is that these countries have different electoral systems. Many speakers mentioned the dual mandate and my party is implacably opposed to it. I gave up my seat on Dublin Corporation and recognise that it is an electoral disadvantage. However, I know that the Minister wants to remove the dual mandate and if that were done, many Members would be at a disadvantage because local councillors would be able to do work on the ground. &ldquo;Pavement politics&rdquo; as the Liberal Democrats call it in England or &ldquo;parish pump&rdquo; politics as it is referred to in Ireland is vital if one is to retain one's seat in this House. Under the current system, with multi-seat constituencies, one must get every vote in, and I speak from personal experience having won my seat by a mere 27 votes. It is absolutely vital that one keeps active locally.</P>
    <P>If we are to get rid of the dual mandate, we must change our electoral system. We must have a European style list system or a top up system such as that to be introduced in Scotland and elsewhere at national level. It would mean that people would vote for policies and ideas, for individuals who may have repaired a footpath locally etc. Under the present system such actions are vital but if we moved away from that we would become legislators, which is what we are supposed to be.</P>
    <P>This system operates in Germany to great effect. Under it, there is also a 5 per cent threshold. This would cause a difficulty for small parties, such as the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party, which enhance democracy. However, the threshold could be lower &ndash; it is 4 per cent in Sweden &ndash; and that is a matter for the Minister. Deputy Dempsey spoke about this when he was in Opposition but, unfortunately, he has left it to one side since taking up office. He should re-examine the issue and introduce a system that would enhance national and local government.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the fact that the Bill does not contain a cap on expenditure. That is an oversight because, undoubtedly, some people will spend huge amounts of money on their campaigns using colour leaflets etc. That is not a level playing field. People become slightly cynical when glossy literature is put through their letter boxes and it may backfire in some cases. However, if one has a great amount of money, one can buy one's way into this House. The first <Col N="1553" /> step is to win a seat on one's local authority. If there is a cap on expenditure for European and general elections, there should also be one for local elections. I ask the Minister to examine that and introduce a Bill before the local elections to cap spending because it is still possible to do so.</P>
    <P>It is eight years since local elections were held and that is indicative of the way local government is treated. Another indication was the debacle surrounding regionalisation and Objective One status when Ireland was the laughing stock of Europe. The EU knows that local government is not taken seriously in Ireland and that it is just there to get as much European money as possible. There is no decentralisation or empowerment. Report after report on local government has been published. The Barrington report is still gathering dust and nothing has been done in this important area. We are worse off as a result because it has been shown that countries and cities which have good local government are able to deal with problems effectively.</P>
    <P>A comparative study of traffic management in Bologna, Helsinki and Athens was recently conducted by Trinity College. Local government in these cities was able to deal effectively with the traffic problem. There is traffic chaos in Dublin simply because it has an antiquated local government system and people have no power to deal with it. There is now a director of traffic who is doing his best under the circumstances.</P>

      <P>If we are to have efficient cities we must have directly elected mayors. It is proposed that London will have a mayor with executive powers.

      <P>This Bill is simple in nature but important. I do not know how long the Minister of State spent writing his contribution but it contained a degree of padding. I served as a member of Mayo County Council for 20 years and had to relinquish my seat when I had the privilege of <Col N="1554" /> being appointed to Cabinet in the previous Government. There is no doubt that service on a local authority is a good training ground for those who wish to serve at national level because it gives an understanding of how local democracy works and provides experience in handling negotiations, dealing with problems and becoming involved in leadership and development, and of how State agencies and local authorities interact.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this Bill should have to be introduced. I was reared in a political household. My late father served in this House for 20 years before I came here and, like him, I was elected to the Dáil before I served on the local authority. I strongly believe that when a person is elected to any body by secret ballot, representation based on that voting method establishes a contract of trust. If that contract is broken for the sake of money, that public representative loses his good name and is not fit to serve at the level at which he or she has been elected. A bought public representative or representative in any capacity is not a representative because he has breached the fundamental contract of trust bestowed by democracy through the ballot box. This Bill is a consequence of that breach.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael proposal is simple and effective. Candidates will know there is a cap on expenditure and they must respond under certain conditions, and that when the election is over a proportion of those who were successful and those who were unsuccessful in each local authority area will have their expenditure assessed. The first part of the Minister's speech raises objections to imposing a limit, such as that an army of people would be needed to check the expenditure, and there are good and valid reasons for raising those objections. However, under our scheme candidates would know from the beginning that, say, eight of the 31 councillors elected in County Mayo and a smaller proportion of unsuccessful candidates will be assessed, that those found to be in breach of clear guidelines will pay the penalty and that the elected members who are found in breach will not be allowed to serve for the remainder of the council term. People would understand those rules and adhere to them. It is a simple and effective measure.</P>
      <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;It is intended to analyse expenditure at the elections and this data will be useful to see if an expenditure limit is necessary in future, especially if different limits should be set for candidates and political parties contesting elections in differently sized authorities.&rdquo;  This information will pile up on sheaves of paper, which could be recycled for many uses. It will be transferred onto floppy disk when one will be able to see immediately how much a candidate has spent. If an eminent Member of this House or a businessman attends a political meeting and decides to contribute to a campaign, he will have to register his donation. He may have completely forgotten that he made it but if he does not register it he will be in breach of the law. I wonder how many will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> Some contributions were valid and there is a lot of experience of this matter in the House. I do not think it necessary to have a dual mandate, to be both an Oireachtas Member and a local authority member. Having served on a local authority and gone through the system, I do not find it a disadvantage to the work one tries to do here. When the dual mandate is abolished it would be a good idea to have a forum on a quarterly basis where issues relevant to a local authority would be discussed by council members and Oireachtas Members. We could discuss the issues relevant to the parties, the issues which should be raised in this House, amendments to legislation, contacts with Ministers etc. National politicians are not fully acquainted with everything which happens at local authority level and a quarterly forum would be a good idea in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of responsibilities of local authority members. It is said that when they are given power they are afraid to use it because tough decisions might have to be made but with the differences in the remit and role of local authority members, this too will change.</P>
    <P>How effective will the chairmen of the new special policy committees be? These committees are a combination of members of political parties and voluntary organisations. Will the chairman of the roads committee have clout within his local authority? Group water schemes are of great interest to local authority members. Will the federation of group water schemes be able to change the priority listing of water schemes within local authorities? If members of Wexford County Council, for instance, decide the list of group water schemes to be dealt with in a year, could the federation change this list without having a member on the relevant committee? If a person becomes an elected representative that should be accompanied by authority.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to deal with section 4 applications. These are being re-introduced in some local authorities even though they are the subject of a reserve judgment of the Supreme Court. I will provide one important example of a planning issue. The Great Western Hotel in Mulranny was considered part of the seaside resort scheme for designation purposes. The person who applied for permission spent £110,000 on plans and designs. After exhaustive meetings with Mayo County Council, planning permission was granted. An objection was lodged by An Taisce and other groups and the scheme was turned down by An Bord Pleanála because there would be too much glass in the proposed building. Sustainable development was lost because it was said it would be intrusive on the landscape, but it is now an eyesore, a collapsing, decaying, derelict building standing on one of the best sites in Europe. The council was prepared to give permission to provide sustainable development and jobs in this area but it was shot down by An Bord Pleanála for some inexplicable reason. It would have been as good as a factory. The £10 million has been <Col N="1556" /> withdrawn and the opportunity to develop the site has been lost.</P>
    <P>I met a businessman recently who informed me that he had to visit a well known golf club, take out green fees and meal tickets and give them to an official in the county council because he would not have received fair treatment if he had not done so. I mentioned the matter to the official concerned who denied any knowledge of it and I must confess that I have no proof that the events outlined actually took place.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that local authority officials also have responsibilities in this area. However, the fact that the power to make decisions is being removed from the contract of trust to which I referred earlier means that the responsibility placed on the shoulders of local government officials will be denigrated. We should set down a clear standard whereby these people can be removed from the employment of local authorities for abusing that privilege.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has admitted that the Bill is a rather minimalistic approach to local government reform. In fairness, he has not stated that it should be seen as a measure of major reform. However, it is an important provision which is intended to introduce order and control to the system of funding of local elections.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kenny and others who stated that the Bill should have included a cap on expenditure. Everyone can cite examples of people who were successful in gaining election as a result of investing considerable sums of money into local election campaigns. It is easier to win a local election in this manner than it is to win a general election because one is obliged to buy less votes. In the past, ambitious young politicians and their older counterparts have spent large sums of money to ensure their election to local authorities or to prevent someone else's election. Their ultimate aim is usually to set themselves up as a candidate in a subsequent general election. That is one of the major flaws in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should accept an amendment on Committee Stage along the lines proposed by Fine Gael, namely, that spot checks should be introduced in tandem with a cap on expenditure. Perhaps he might consider using the model that applies to Deputies in this regard but some effort must be made to cap expenditure. If action is not taken, the legislation will become meaningless. What is the point in declaring expenditure of up to £50,000 if there is no cap? Our efforts here will be wasted if a cap is not introduced because under the terms of the Bill people are only obliged to state the origin of funding, the names of contributors etc. I advise the Minister of State and his officials to give serious consideration to Fine Gael's suggestion because if a cap is introduced in tandem with spot checks, we will be in a position to penalise those who exceed the limits on expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware that community candidates, independents and those representing <Col N="1557" /> interest groups are discouraged from going forward for election because they cannot compete with the major parties which have ample resources and various means of collecting money. The main political parties are well versed in distributing election literature, displaying posters, using cards on election day and operating election offices as call centres from where volunteers can contact people and canvass their votes. There is no way independent or community candidates can compete with that kind of financial input from the major parties or with candidates who have access to large campaign funds.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Bill will introduce some order to the financing of local elections, but without the presence of a cap on expenditure it will not serve its purpose. I have no concrete evidence but I retain suspicions about the activities of certain candidates in previous elections. Certain candidates put forward strong views on particular issues and there is a public perception that if they are elected they might be able to influence planning matters. Following the abolition of land rates and water charges, councillors have very little power in terms of spending money but they retain their influence in respect of planning. There is a perception abroad that speculators and others who provide financial support to candidates or county councillors with expertise in planning matters will have a better opportunity of obtaining planning permission or the proper advice. Everyone has suspicions about candidates who engaged in such behaviour in the past and perhaps the tribunals will confirm those suspicions. The fact that a cap on expenditure will not be introduced will allow some candidates to obtain additional funding if it appears that they may be able to influence events.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the dual mandate. I am standing as a candidate in the local elections but I would have preferred to inform my party that, due to my Dáil commitments, I will not be able to devote 100 per cent of my time to Kerry County Council if I am elected. The Minister would have done everyone a favour if he had excluded Oireachtas Members from the elections but he did not do so. In this instance, I believe that is a result of the influence of Deputy Healy-Rae. The Minister should have gone the full distance and abolished the dual mandate but I accept that he has given a commitment to do so in the major local government reform Bill which is currently in preparation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Kenny's comments in respect of the forum. A mechanism should be put in place which would allow councillors, Deputies, Ministers and Senators serving particular constituencies to come together and meet on a quarterly basis. That would be a good exercise in democracy, particularly if people felt obligated to attend. If such a forum was nothing more than a talking shop, it would probably survive for three to four meetings before people's interest fizzled out. However, it is a good proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> The county manager in Kerry is a young individual with modern ideas. He called some Members of the Oireachtas to an 8 o'clock breakfast meeting last week, which I, as someone who is not a member of a county council, found to be a good exercise. The Minister should examine this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said he hopes to issue guidelines as soon as possible.  That is important. Draft guidelines should be issued now to the local authorities and to candidates and it should be pointed out that they may not be the final guidelines. It is important that councillors and candidates are given draft guidelines on expenditure and so forth so that they will be prepared for the final proposals.</P>
    <P>This all comes down to bookkeeping and people being disciplined in keeping proper records. Keeping records of expenses is alien to many of us. Treasurers of branches and cumainn who have never kept accounts are worried that if they make a statement, which is subsequently found to be incorrect, they could end up in court.</P>
    <P>I agree with the introduction of electronic voting, which will avoid the problems associated with the present cumbersome but effective and foolproof system. With our PR system, it will be difficult to operate. I look forward to seeing how the system will operate when it comes to a 20th count. We will have to bring in Bill Gates to devise the ultimate system. It is fine in theory, but it will be difficult to operate in practice. I look forward to the introduction of major legislation on local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate, which I am sure all Members will agree was far-reaching. In any debate on local electoral matters, it is inevitable speakers will touch on the many areas for which local authorities are responsible. I will confine my remarks generally to the provisions of the Bill. Deputies will have other opportunities this year to debate the important points raised in regard to planning, housing, ethics, local government reform and other relevant areas. The House will have another occasion shortly to discuss the broad role of local authorities when the constitutional amendment Bill is introduced to provide for a referendum to be held in June to insert into the Constitution an acknowledgement of the role local authorities play in our society. Two other important Bills will be introduced, a comprehensive local government Bill and a consolidated planning Bill. Deputy Stanton and others raised the issue of the forthcoming referendum to insert a new article into the Constitution which would recognise the role played by local authorities in our society. The constitutional amendment Bill is expected to be published on Friday, as the Deputy stated. It must be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas by 11 May and I understand that Bill will be before the House on 11 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> I wish to respond to Deputy Gilmore's amendment asking the House to decline to give a second reading to this Bill. Other Deputies also stated that the Bill does not include a limitation on a candidate's election expenditure at local elections. The scheme provided for in the Bill is simple. It retains the principles of disclosure of donations and expenditure contained in the Electoral Act, 1997, without the bureaucracy, which a scheme under section 72 of that Act would entail. The Bill goes further than the 1997 Act. This was acknowledged by some Deputies in the debate last Thursday. Each candidate will be required to state whether he or she uses his or her own money or donations to fund expenditure on the election and details will have to be provided on any donation received over £500.</P>
    <P>I would like to consider some of the reasons advanced by the Opposition for an expenditure limit at local elections. The two main points raised were that there should be no difficulty in determining expenditure limits and that there should not be two sets of standards, one local and one national. There are a number of substantive reasons the Bill does not include a limit on expenditure at the local elections. First, there is the scale of size, number of candidates and constituencies at local elections as compared to Dáil and European elections. We are not comparing like with like. This country is not alone in not having expenditure limits at local elections. Most of our EU partners do not have expenditure limits at local elections.</P>
    <P>Second, any limit on expenditure would have to be fair to all candidates. What limit or limits should be set? I have not heard any Member of either House advocate the setting of a limit or limits suggesting an amount or amounts. There is probably a good reason for that. I do not know if anybody has much, if any, information on what would be a fair amount to set as a limit. If it is so easy to decide expenditure limits, why did the parties opposite, when in Government, not include them in the Electoral Bill, 1994, as it was know when it was amended extensively on Committee Stage in 1997. The parties knew that local elections were to be held in the near future and if limits were included then, we might not be here today discussing this Bill. I can only conclude that they, too, recognised the difficulties of deciding expenditure limits for local elections without any research being carried out on past trends and on what an adequate limit or limits should be.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the argument that just because there are monetary limits for the Dáil and European elections, we should have limits for local elections. One must ask how the Dáil limits were set? What research was carried out to see if the limits were fair and adequate? While we have no experience of operating the Dáil limits at a general election, we have experience of operating the limits at by-elections. I was interested to hear <Col N="1560" /> Deputy Hayes say that the existing Dáil limits are adequate, but what happened at the Limerick and Dublin North by-elections?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenditure limits were exceeded by a national agent in Limerick and by an election agent in Dublin North. Does this suggest adequacy? How adequate will the limits be in three years' time when a general election is held?</P>
      <P>The Minister proposed that instead of picking an amount out of the air, just for the sake of having expenditure limits, the candidates' completed forms should be analysed so that in future there would be hard information available to consider whether there should be limits, either an overall limit or different limits for different types or sizes of local electoral areas. This will also highlight any candidate who expended large sums at the election and, of more interest, how successful he or she was at the election.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite also stated that a section 72 scheme, regardless of the bureaucracy and the cost it would entail, should be introduced. Do we want a situation to develop in local electoral areas where there could be more election agents, accountants and other staff than the number of candidates just to keep a record of every item of expenditure?</P>

      <P>I also heard Deputies complain about the number of forms to be completed. We cannot have it both ways. If we want a scheme with expenditure limits, we will have more form filling, otherwise the scheme would not work.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for imposing expenditure limits at local elections just for the sake of having limits. There is no evidence available that the lack of an expenditure limit will lead to an increase in expenditure by all candidates. There is no evidence that the lack of a limit will benefit candidates and parties who can raise the most money. Deputies know that local elections are about electing local candidates. The local electorate is not dumb. It will not be misled by a candidate of no substance who has plenty of money. It is insulting to the intelligence of the electorate for the Deputies opposite to assert that the electorate will be duped by extensive expenditure.</P>
      <P>To summarise, the proposals in the Bill will meet the major principles established in the Electoral Act, 1997, by a scheme which is focused at local level in line with the purpose of the elections. The scheme will be less bureaucratic, less costly and easier to understand and implement than a scheme under the 1997 Act. After the election, the documentation will be available locally for inspection by any interested person.</P>
      <P>We want a workable scheme which is fair. We do not want a scheme with expenditure limits which would make the scheme unworkable and which might necessitate an army of accountants and agents to monitor it. We do not want to have more agents and accountants than candidates in local electoral areas. I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment and I would ask him not to press it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes and Deputy Gilmore referred to the fact that the Bill's provisions generally relate only to the four weeks before polling day. The Bill provides that expenditure on election expenses between the polling day order and polling day should be declared in the statement to be furnished under section 13. The Bill also provides that all election expenses incurred before the date of the polling day order for the provision of property, goods or services for use during the period between the polling day order and polling day should be included in the statement. However, for the forthcoming election, the operative date for disclosing election expenses will be the date the President signed the Bill into law, as until that date there is no legal duty on a candidate to keep records of expenditure, nor is there any legal provision governing election expenses at local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> Deputies referred to the fact that the Bill will permit chairperson's of Oireachtas committees to stand for local elections. I would like to explain the background to this matter. Section 6 of the Local Government Act, 1994, provides for the disqualification of a range of office holders from local authority membership, including MEPs, Ministers, Ministers of State, judges, the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, and chairs of Oireachtas committees. In regard to the latter, this disqualification does not currently apply but it will commence for the purposes of the June local elections and thereafter. Under section 6, the chairs of some Oireachtas committees are exempt from disqualification, but not others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 24 of the Bill will remove the disqualification in respect of the chairs of all Oireachtas committees. Naturally, this would apply irrespective of the individual or party holding the position of chair of any committee. There are currently over 20 such committees along with a number of sub-committees. All committees should be treated equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In the long run and in the context of the Government's programme for the renewal of local government, the most appropriate response would be the termination of the dual local authority-Oireachtas mandate for all members without differentiation. With this in mind, the major Local Government Reform Bill, which is currently being drafted to underpin the renewal programme and modernise and consolidate local government law will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the elimination of the dual mandate from a future date, probably the local elections in 2004.</P>
      <P>The question was also raised about the disqualification of Oireachtas Members from the post of cathaoirleach of local authorities. This is different from the disqualification of the chairs of Oireachtas committees from local authority membership. Unlike the latter, the disqualification of Oireachtas Members from the post of cathaoirleach applies equally to all Members of the Oireachtas. It does not differentiate between Oireachtas Members by disqualifying some and not others. Even under the current system of local government, the post of cathaoirleach brings with it substantial demands in terms of time and commitment. It is only right and proper that a councillor is in a position to focus fully on the job of cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Government Bill being prepared will provide a sound and modern context for local authorities to deliver their services efficiently. The position of the cathaoirleach of a local authority is under consideration in the context of this Bill. Under present law, he or she is elected annually by the members of the local authority con<Col N="1563" /> cerned. In practice this has meant a one year term of office for the post and, as such, is unlikely to enhance democratic leadership and responsibility. Among the options being considered to enhance the democratic mandate are the election of the cathaoirleach directly by the people, or a continuation of the present system but with a longer term than the current annual one. Such a cathaoirleach would be in a far better position to provide leadership underpinned by an enhanced democratic mandate and supported by the SPC chairs. The legislation to be published soon will set out the proposed arrangements as well as other measures to underline the distinctive status of local authority membership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes referred to further duplication of returns by Members of the Oireachtas. If a Member of the Oireachtas is a candidate, whether elected or not, he or she will have to furnish a donation-election expenses statement. This is in addition to the statements he or she will continue to have to make to the Public Offices Commission under the Electoral Act,1997, and the Ethics Act. If Members of the Oireachtas are excluded there will be complaints that all candidates are not being treated equally and also the information on expenditure at the local elections will not be complete. This would reduce the value of any analysis afterwards of this expenditure. In any event, why should Members of the Oireachtas be treated differently from other candidates at local elections?</P>
    <P>In a Dáil or European election, the election agent of a candidate must furnish a statement of election expenses. While a successful candidate does not have to submit a donation statement until the following January, an unsuccessful candidate has to submit a separate donation statement. In other words, if the 1997 Act was followed, two statements would have to be furnished. Under the Bill's provisions, only one statement has to be furnished.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance is looking at the possibility of combining some or all of the returns to be made by Members of the Oireachtas under the two main Acts. The content of the forms at local elections will also be considered in this review. If the Minister's proposal on ending the dual mandate to be included in the new Local Government Bill is implemented, this problem will not arise again. In addition, the forms will be kept as short and as simple as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes and Deputy Gilmore raised the question of third party expenditure. The system for disclosure of election expenses relates essentially to expenditure incurred by and on behalf of candidates and political parties. It is possible that persons who are not themselves directly involved in the election may seek to influence the outcome and, for this purpose, incur expenditure. Persons who are not connected to or associated with any party or candidate contesting the election may also decide to incur expenditure with a view to promoting or opposing a particular outcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> It would be inappropriate and, possibly, contrary to the spirit if not the letter of the constitutional provision regarding freedom of expression to prohibit advertising by third parties. Everybody has a right to express his or her views on any matter of public interest and incur expenditure for this purpose, if he or she thinks it proper to do so. The Act places no restriction on this kind of advertising and sets no limits to the amounts that may be spent for this purpose, except that such a person is required to register in advance with a local authority and furnish an account of such expenditure after the election in the same way as an agent or designated person of a party or candidate and such information will be published.</P>
    <P>The publisher of a newspaper, magazine or other periodical publication is prohibited from publishing any advertisement or notice in relation to an election purporting to promote or oppose, directly or indirectly, the interests of a political party or a candidate at that election at the request of any person other than an election agent, designated person, candidate or a person authorised by them unless the person produces to the publisher a certificate from a local authority that the person has complied with the requirements of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern asked about two aspects of the Bill, one of which is donations. Only donations over £500 have to be disclosed separately on the statement to be furnished to a local authority. Smaller donations do not have to be disclosed unless the aggregate of small donations from the same person to the same candidate at the same election exceeds £500.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's second point concerned the reuse of election material. In so far as local elections are concerned, the position is covered in section 6(1)(<i>b</i>)(ix) of the Bill. If election expenses were incurred in the provision of property, goods or services for use in respect of a previous presidential, Dáil, European or local election and such expenses were included in a statement of election expenses furnished to the Public Offices Commission or to a local authority in relation to the previous election, such election expenses would be an exempted expenditure under the Bill. However the position does not work in reverse. The 1997 Act does not provide that the cost of property, goods or services incurred in connection with a local election and disclosed in a statement to a local authority is exempted expenditure for a Dáil or European election. This is an aspect of the Electoral Act, 1997, which will have to be reviewed at the next available opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne raised the point about photographs on ballot papers for local elections. As Deputies are aware, there will not be photographs on local election ballot papers. The Minister has undertaken to review the position of photographs on all ballot papers after an evaluation of their use in the European elections. The use of photographs on ballot papers in the European election is a first for this country, and indeed <Col N="1565" /> for most other countries. Very few countries put photographs on ballot papers. To assist in the evaluation after the June elections, the Minister has commissioned a study to be carried out by consultants on the use of photographs including the assistance photographs for electors with literacy difficulties. I have noted the comments of Deputies in the matter. The Minister would welcome the views of Deputies on the use of photographs on ballot papers after their use in the June European elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies referred to the making of annual disclosure by elected members. The local government Bill currently in preparation provides an ideal opportunity for the review and preparation of an ethical framework for the local government service. This review will include the widening of ethical provisions to all local government activities and not just the planning area. It will take account of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the draft standards in public office proposals. It will also take account of similar legislation in other jurisdictions. Additional areas to be considered include powers and mechanisms for investigations of contraventions, the drawing up of a code of conduct and the widening of existing disclosures and declaration provisions.</P>
      <P>The question of introducing annual disclosure, akin to that required of Members of the Oireachtas and MEPs, can be considered when the local government Bill is debated in the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes raised the issue of additional duties for local authorities as a result of the Bill. The whole idea of the Bill is to provide for a straightforward set of arrangements for everybody concerned &ndash; candidates, national agents, designated persons, third parties and local authorities. Local authorities will have duties in relation to the receipt of ratification of appointment of a designated person, publishing details in a local newspaper and responsibilities in relation to statements made under section 13. I do not accept that these duties are excessive or unduly onerous, especially as they will arise only once every five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the issue of local government reform and spent a considerable time accusing the Minister of inactivity. I do not know where he has been for the past two years but I will list some of the areas where progress has been made. A new funding system which provides additional resources came into place on 1 January based on legislation enacted last year. Local authorities are at present setting up new strategic policy committees and finding new ways of involving local people more closely in their work. All 34 city and county authorities have held <Col N="1566" /> their first SPC meetings. An implementation programme for the integration of the local development and local government systems has been drawn up by a task force chaired by the Minister. There is increased emphasis by local authorities on customer service, including a pilot scheme of one stop shops and increasing emphasis on value for money and performance indicators. A range of initiatives is currently under way to modernise human resources policies in local authorities. An initiative to counteract gender imbalance among local authority officials is in hand, and a long service gratuity for councillors aims to recognise the dedicated service of long serving councillors and to widen the opportunity for new entrants, including women and young people, at the local elections in June. Legislation is in preparation which will put in place a modern statutory framework for local government. This legislation will provide a new legislative foundation to underpin the programme of renewal and also implement a range of reforms. I am sure the House agrees that this is a substantial programme of local government renewal and contrasts favourably with progress made in this area by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies Farrelly and Fleming referred to problems arising from the extension of town boundaries for electoral purposes. This arose in 1994 as part of the programme of local government reform. The Local Government Act, 1994, provided for the extension of the boundaries of urban areas in order to bring within these areas development which has taken place outside the existing boundaries and to extend the right to vote at urban elections to electors resident in the urban environs. Under this provision the boundaries of 56 urban local authorities were extended for local electoral purposes at the 1994 local elections. The extensions made for electoral purposes continue for the June local elections. As regards an alteration to a boundary for all local authority purposes, Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991, provides for the procedures to alter a boundary. It is appreciated that the situation following the 1994 revisions is not ideal, especially in Drogheda and Carlow, and needs to be regularised while taking account of financial and organisation complexities pointed to in the report on town local government, Towards Cohesive Local Government &ndash; Town and County.  The forthcoming local government Bill will provide a modern statutory framework for local authorities and a new context within which the question of local authority boundaries can be considered.</P>
    <P>I have noted the comments made by Deputies concerning electronic voting and counting, and I will keep the comments in mind as this matter develops. I appreciate that the immediate reaction might be one of reservation, and this is understandable. I would envisage that under any scheme introduced provision would be made for electors who may <Col N="1567" /> not wish to use the new method. Some systems have been demonstrated recently to the Department and they are easy to operate. Demonstrations by personnel from Holland, England and the USA were arranged for Opposition spokesperson but, unfortunately, for good reasons, they were unable to be present. When the research on different equipment is carried out in the autumn I will arrange for a demonstration for Deputies, if requested.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes referred to the research to be carried out under section 25. The Department will not retain the ballot papers longer than necessary to capture the details from the papers. While I cannot be certain at this point, I would expect that the ballot papers would be destroyed after six months as provided for at present in legislation. It is expected that the capture of the data on the ballot papers will be undertaken by the franchise section of my Department or under its control or supervision. <Col N="1568" /> Discussions have yet to be finalised with companies about the software for the STV count. I expect that the software could be developed to reduce, if not end, the present randomness in the count. This is a matter yet to be investigated and it is one which will arise when legislation is drafted to allow for the use of electronic voting and counting, if that matter arises in the future.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their co-operation and constructive approach to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with the main matters raised. This is important legislation. It will oblige political parties and candidates to disclose expenditure and also for the disclosure of donations over £500 received by candidates at the local elections which are used to meet the expenditure incurred. It is an important Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Allen on Tuesday, 27 April 1999:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to immediately set up a capital programme for the refurbishment and upgrading of substandard swimming pools in operation throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night in referring to the number of unkept and run-down swimming pools throughout the country I explicitly drew attention to the fact that I was extremely disappointed that provision had not been made in the anti-drugs package announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, to initiate the badly-needed local neighbourhood swimming pool in Jobstown in which there are social problems but no network of facilities or amenities for youth activity. There is a huge population of young people in the area. I sincerely hope the Government will revisit the issue in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I do not know the detail but I sincerely hope the matter will be put right.</P>
      <P>On the 50 metre pool in respect of which tenders are on the Minister's desk, having examined a possible half dozen locations, including universities, the Kitt Campbell survey was unequivocal. It recommended that Tallaght ought to be the location chosen. I sincerely hope the Minister will keep this in mind in making his decision. There is a separate proposal for a major leisure facility where the local authority, the chamber of commerce and the private sector would be partners. It involves additional facilities &ndash; money making opportunities &ndash; and deserves study also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for tabling the motion. It should be accepted that sport in general and swimming in particular is not just for the well heeled and those who can afford to pay large <Col N="1569" /><Col N="1570" /> fees. Public swimming pools have been the poor relation. They have been under-resourced, provided with the most basic facilities and the first to feel the cutbacks at local authority level. The less well-off are the most affected.</P>
      <P>The reply to Deputy Allen's parliamentary question on 23 March 1999 indicates the size of the task ahead. I welcome the transfer of responsibility for this area to the Minister, Deputy McDaid, who is a man of action and somebody who will take the issue by the scruff of the neck and do something positive. He must, however, have the resources to do this. Given the size of the national lottery excess, there is no scarcity of resources. It is a matter of setting priorities.</P>
      <P>The many upmarket facilities provided by the private sector in recent years are of no benefit to those who cannot afford the high annual fees charged. School children, young people on low wages, of which there are many, the unemployed and old age pensioners are bypassed by the private facilities. Publicly provided facilities should be of an equally high standard. There are enough divisions in society without institutionalising the haves and the have nots in swimming.</P>
      <P>I refer to the application for grant aid for the public swimming pool in Naas. The funding sought amounts to £1.4 million and will allow the authorities to bring the pool up to modern standards. It is availed of every hour it can be open and school children make up a large part of its clientele. They deserve the best we can give and we can afford to provide it.</P>
      <P>I refer to the position in the north Kildare towns of Clane, Kilcock, Leixlip, Maynooth and Celbridge. There is no public swimming pool in the area which has a young population of approximately 50,000 people. There are some private facilities which are either oversubscribed or too expensive. Swimming clubs have to bus their members, mostly children, to facilities outside the area. The cost is prohibitive.</P>
      <P>Recently, my colleague in Leixlip, Councillor Colm Purcell, commissioned a feasibility study of the provision of a public swimming pool in the area and I congratulate him on his initiative. A site has been identified and costings made. The proposed 25 metre pool will serve the entire catchment area of 50,000 people and will cost in the region of £3.4 million. An application will be made to the Minister in the near future. I look forward to a favourable examination of this worthy and feasible project.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for tabling the motion and I am confident the Minister will find the resources to do the job he has identified.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the debate. I compliment the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, on their initiative in the area of sport and sport related activity. The resources provided under the youth services fund will be well spent. We do not spend half enough. The grants for the refurbishment of the Poppintree sports centre, the Ballymun recreation centre, the new sports centre at John Paul Park, Cabra, and the other sport related initiatives have been widely welcomed. I am glad Fianna Fáil Ministers are delivering on the appointment of a number of sport support workers to help clubs develop a wider range of activity, introduce more members and hold on to existing members.</P>
      <P>Swimming is a life long sport which needs to be promoted. The local authority in Dublin took a leading role in the 1970s and 1980s in constructing pools in what are now called disadvantaged areas, although, in those days, we called them working class areas. These pools were built at a time when energy costs were lower and were mainly rectangular tanks or holes in the ground with a few extra facilities. They are now in great need of refurbishment and upgrading. An extensive programme of refurbishment has been submitted to the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>Plans in respect of Ballyfermot swimming pool were submitted some time ago. Further technical evaluations are taking place in relation to that pool. Deputy Callely, myself and others on the local authority earnestly hope refurbishment of that pool will start in the near future. Ballymun and Finglas pools in my constituency are also undergoing preparation for refurbishment. I hope Ballymun pool will be upgraded as part of Ballymun's regeneration. As previous speakers said, nothing should be too good for the people in those areas. We need not only to modernise these pools, but to extend them, provide fitness suites, coffee docks and relaxation areas to attract a broad range of customer. We must also insist the same modest entrance fee is charged because it would be the death knell of swimming and swimming related activities if the local authority had to increase charges further. Those of us on the local authority have resisted excessive entrance fee increases.</P>
      <P>If I had my way, swimming would be on the primary school curriculum because it is the best way to build self-confidence and promote physical development. I know it is a costly sport and many schools fundraise for this purpose.</P>
      <P>An initiative which could be repeated which was introduced by Deputy Fahey when he was Minister with responsibility for youth, was the provision of £0.5 million for the development of swimming and such activities in disadvantaged areas. It was a very successful initiative and the notion of sport for all is one we should promote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the motion. This is an opportune time to address issues such as upgrading, refurbishment and development of existing pools. I compliment the Government and the Minister on <Col N="1572" /> the focused way in which they are approaching the development of sport. It is the first time we have had a Minister of Cabinet rank dealing with sport. The assessment of need which is taking place at national and local authority levels will, I hope, lead to an extensive action plan. We now need a commitment to funding over a period. I know money cannot be thrown at everything but not enough money can be spent on this sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and encourage the Government and the Minister to increase the fund already in place to refurbish pools. A number of pools were built some years ago at a low cost, but they have serviced communities very well. Their provision encouraged swimming. The time has come to refurbish them. Given the sites on which many are built, there is considerable room to improve the structures and facilities. The fund should be increased significantly to ensure every county benefits from this suggestion.</P>
      <P>The pool in Kilkenny has serviced the local community, schools and, particularly, disabled people. It is in need of immediate refurbishment, extension and modernisation. The dressing rooms need to be brought up to current standards and a viewing area needs to be constructed as does a restaurant and activity centre.</P>
      <P>The growth in the number of pools and gymnasiums in the private sector has been considerable and they are normally attached to hotels. The same type of service and access should be provided to schools, disabled people and the general public. To achieve that, we need to be pro-active in our local authorities and encourage them to put forward plans which will encompass the current use as well as the possible use of pools because a growing number of people cannot access these low cost pools given the restrictions in pool size.</P>
      <P>Money needs to be spent on a pool in Carlow town. We should join the local community in providing a service in the public sector. I encourage the Minister to look also at the provision of new pools. Perhaps this could be done in partnership with the private sector if suitable sites are made available to it by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important motion. The Minister outlined last night that the Government has a programme for the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools. The Government's commitment to the development of sport and recreation and of new facilities is evident when one considers that £39 million is being spent on sport this year. During the last year of the rainbow coalition, £13 million was spent on sport. I welcome the Government's and the Minister's commitment to the development of extra facilities. Some £50 million has been committed to a capital expenditure programme for the next three years. That represents a three fold increase on what the previous <Col N="1573" /> Government committed to the development of facilities.</P>
      <P>I am glad the programme the Minister has in place includes the upgrading of Monaghan pool. He has also made funding available for the development of a new pool facility in Bailieborough. As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know, an energetic committee there put much effort into that. The Minister, in making an allocation along with other public agencies, has helped the efforts of the local community.</P>
      <P>In 1993 the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, approved a new state of the art swimming pool for Cavan town. At that time, he allocated well in excess of £2 million towards its development. That pool also included the additional facilities of a children's pool, sauna, gymnasium and crèche. Great credit is due to the local committee which raised the necessary local contribution. The committee, under the chairmanship of Councillor Pat Conaty, put in much hard work. The local public representatives and voluntary organisation worked hand in hand to ensure the pool was provided. We are grateful to Deputy Michael Smith, in his capacity as Minister at that time, for giving speedy approval for the pool and for providing the necessary funding so that we could have a modern facility.</P>
      <P>This Government's commitment to sport and recreation is reflected well in its decision to establish the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. For the first time, the interest of sports-people, professional and amateur, is represented at Cabinet level very ably and with great foresight by the Minister, Deputy McDaid.</P>
      <P>We are all well aware of the importance of sport in terms of promoting fitness and wellbeing. It is essential to create a truly healthy and vibrant society. It also promotes a positive image of our country to the world as our professional athletes are truly our ambassadors at international level. We all feel a sense of pride when we see our flag raised and our anthem played at an international event.</P>
      <P>Sport is a necessary part of the growth of the individual and is as important as formal education in its own way. Sport boosts self-confidence and self-reliance and instils a sense of personal achievement and pride at what has been gained by effort and endurance. Young people achieve a sense of how good it feels to be fit and in good health. They not only earn respect for the hard knocks the sport often throws at them through inevitable failures and defeats or occasional injuries, they also learn the importance of team spirit and that co-operation and the pooling of talent brings the best results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport is also a very effective weapon in the fight against drug abuse as it offers a clear and attractive alternative to the misery and suffering of dependence on artificial stimulants. Sport and recreation policy must embrace all members of the community. It is easy to forget that sport and fitness facilities must be accessible to the dis<Col N="1574" /> abled. For that reason I commend the Minister and the Government on their successful efforts to secure the Special Olympics for Ireland. I wish all involved every success. We are all grateful for the sacrifices made by the many professional and amateur sports people who bring immense honour to our country. They are true ambassadors.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the sports capital development programme. The Minister mentioned that disadvantaged areas, in particular, would be targeted for assistance. Disadvantaged areas do not merely exist in urban centres, there are many disadvantaged areas in rural Ireland and people in clubs and parishes throughout Ireland make enormous efforts to ensure facilities are provided to allow young people to participate in sport and recreation. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the applications in his Department from small and lesser populated areas receive particular attention.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that it requires great effort on the part of what is usually a small number of people to keep a football or athletics club going. It costs a lot of money to develop facilities appropriate to today's standards. I hope the Minister will secure additional funding in the years ahead to ensure sporting organisations receive the necessary financial assistance to upgrade, extend and improve their existing facilities. It is very difficult to raise funding on a sustained basis in a small rural community. Investment in facilities in rural parishes and small towns and villages will pay handsome dividends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate. At the outset, I acknowledge the benefits I anticipate will accrue from the youth services facility fund. I acknowledge the funds allocated in my constituency to the Donnycarney Community Forum for the upgrading of the parochial hall, to groups in Kilmore west and other groups such as the Ardlea youth club. We look forward with interest to developments there. I am sure the organisations involved will succeed in ensuring youth participation in sporting activities rather than undesirable, anti-social ones.</P>
      <P>Huge benefits accrue to communities in which swimming pools are situated. We are all aware of the high costs associated with the running of pools. The capital outlay for building and refurbishment is enormous. I was particularly pleased that Fianna Fáil recognised and endorsed the value of sport and recreation in its 1997 election manifesto and proceeded with the establishment for the first time of a Cabinet position, a Minister with responsibility for sport and recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on their successful achievements in the Department's infancy in pulling together their areas of responsibility, developing and formulating policy and encouraging increased participation in the promotion and development of sport and recreation. I am aware of the Minister's objectives and goals and his success in obtaining Cabinet approval for expenditure of £39 million in <Col N="1575" /> 1999. The swimming pool programme is now directly funded by the Exchequer with up to 80 per cent in capital grants being provided to approved new pools and up to 100 per cent in refurbishment grants. I welcome the available grant aid of up to 80 per cent of the cost of modest ancillary facilities such as saunas, steam rooms and so on. From a practical point of view, market demands require the establishment of such facilities in conjunction with swimming pools.</P>
    <P>I wish to touch on two constituency matters. I pay tribute to the Vincentians at St. Paul's College, Sybil Hill, Raheny, for their provision over the past 24 years of a tremendous swimming pool facility on the college campus for the pupils and the wider community. The Vincentians are anxious to refurbish the pool. I was happy to attend a recent round table meeting with the St. Paul's College authorities &ndash; Fr. Meade and the bursar, Eilish Hayes, and Frank Murray and John Ryan from Dublin Corporation. The corporation clearly recognises the benefits of the St. Paul's pool and is anxious that the necessary refurbishment work is carried out. I put the Minister on notice that a very worthy application for refurbishment of the pool will shortly be submitted to him for consideration. My constituency colleagues and I will vigorously pursue a favourable funding decision.</P>
    <P>I wish to salute Philip Smith of Westwood for his vision and determination in regard to his new leisure development in Fairview Park, Fairview, Dublin 3. The development will include a 50 metre pool. Mr. Smith is one of the tender applicants for the 50 metre international standard pool. I hope he will be successful in his bid. He showed his commitment to provide a 50 metre pool in advance of the Government tender being invited and identified a suitable site for the purpose. The Fairview site is ideally located near the M50 between the sea and the airport. Hopefully, the impending High Court hearing next month on the challenge of the disqualified tender applicant will be adjudicated on speedily. Philip Smith can and will deliver the 50 metre pool in time for the millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the initiatives he has taken in the area of sport and recreational activities. He has acknowledged for the first time that sport and recreational activity is a central feature of a new and modern Ireland and its people. More particularly, he has provided a funding allocation for the next few years which will ensure that the widest possible opportunities will be available to people. He has linked those provisions into areas of disadvantage and has acknowledged the importance of investing money to ensure facilities are available for young people in Dublin and elsewhere, particularly those who are victims and prospective victims of serious drug activity. The Minister is to be complimented for recognising the need which exists in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> The Minister stated that approximately 425,000 people are involved in swimming which is now the largest sporting activity in Ireland aside from walking. I would venture to say that golf comes a close third. All these sports contribute to the development of young people and others and to recreational opportunities for the elderly. It was suggested that perhaps swimming should form part of the leaving certificate syllabus. First aid should be part of swimming instruction. Years ago first aid was an essential element in the development of young men and women in primary schools. It is important that public swimming areas have the type of instruction available to them which would include first aid. Too many people are lost in a variety of circumstances where first aid is not available.</P>
    <P>Swimming pools cost a great deal of money and public pools in particular, which are competing with private leisure centres and centres of public recreational activity associated with hotels, etc., are often loss makers.</P>
    <P>School transport should be available to bring and encourage children to travel to pools which normally they might not be able to visit, particularly in rural areas where considerable distances are involved and perhaps the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will get their officials together to examine whether this is possible.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister has given approval to Roscommon County Council to seek tenders for its pool. The council must decide whether to build a new pool or refurbish the old one. I thank the Minister for his approval as it is the first time any serious acknowledgement has been given by a Minister to the situation pertaining in Roscommon where the pool is closed due to its failure to reach the necessary standards as a result of a number of difficulties which emerged over the years. Initially, it was a low cost pool.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to disagree with the motion. Years ago there were very few swimming pools in Dublin and then a raft of them were provided at the same time about 20 or 25 years ago. Many of these are now in bad order and need much money spent on them. I did not realise but am glad that the swimming pool fund has been transferred from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Over the years that fund has been too small. Local authorities, certainly in the Dublin area, find it very hard to tap into it and much time is used in processing and getting funds from it. I can see the fund has a future now that it has been transferred to the proper Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister outlined the funding he received for sport and I congratulate him on it. It is good that we have a Minister focusing directly on sport. The figures have increased tremendously in recent years. However, further increases are necessary as we are losing the battle. I view money spent on sport as an invest<Col N="1577" /> ment in preventative medicine. Yet I am constantly attacked by constituents who complain about the £6 million or £7 million given to Croke Park per year for three years, saying that if that funding had been given to Health in addition to the £3,500 million the Department already receives, their granny would get a bed or their mother would get the hospital visit. We should push stronger the line that money spent on sport is an investment in preventative medicine and that it is good value for society.</P>
    <P>I was delighted by the Minister's announcement last weekend concerning a new indoor sports facility at Santry Stadium which will be in my new constituency. I understand it includes a running track, but I presume most running tracks are circular and I do not know what the Minister's plans are for the area in the middle. I hope many other facilities, not necessarily a swimming pool, are provided. I accept that the project is at the feasibility study stage, but I know the Minister achieves what he sets his eyes on. I look forward to the new complex being built and hope it caters for many sports. Unfortunately, given the weather we have, outdoor training is not very appropriate for many sports, including athletics, in particular sprinting, and an indoor facility is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I and the country are fortunate, and perhaps Opposition Deputies are envious, that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have such an interest in sport. Their religious homes are more inclined to be Croke Park and the Curragh than Croagh Patrick and Lough Derg.</P>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the various points made by Deputies both last night and tonight and there is general agreement that a number of the local authority pools, particularly those built in the 1960s and 1970s, need a substantial amount of State investment to bring them up to an acceptable standard.</P>
      <P>As outlined last night by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Chris Flood, customer expectation of the standard of sport and leisure facilities on offer is currently very high. Local authority pools must compete with private facilities which are being built throughout the country and must provide additional facilities over and above the basic pool if they are to be attractive and commercially viable. Applications for new pools that my Department has received from local authorities in recent years recognise this and the standard and range of facilities provided have improved significantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £16 million in grant-aid has been allocated under the swimming pool programme in respect of three new pools and refurbishment works at a further 25 pools since 1988. The provision of £3 million in the swimming pool programme this year is fully committed to projects under construction or fully approved and on which work is expected to commence shortly. In <Col N="1578" /> addition, my Department has nearly £40 million worth of projects at various stages of planning which will be competing for funding in the future but on which no commitments as regards grant-aid have yet been made. Many of these projects have been referred to by Deputies last night and tonight. I have no doubt that all these projects are worthy of funding in their own right, but unfortunately there will always be limits on the funding available and difficult choices have had to be made.</P>
    <P>I am committed to developing facilities in a strategic and focused way. This means establishing priorities, avoiding overlaps and ensuring full access to available facilities. I am determined that the <i>ad hoc</i> way funding was allocated in the past under the swimming pool programme will not continue and that commitments in the future will be based on specific requirements of particular areas. In future the development of pools will be done in a planned and structured way, concentrating on areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that substantial amounts of State funding need to be invested in local authority pools. By the end of this Government's term of office, I am determined that this serious problem will have been addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. I compliment Deputy Allen on bringing this motion before the House. I am glad he has focused the House on a very worthy need throughout the country with so many swimming pools in need of attention.</P>
      <P>I will focus on the importance of having a proper swimming facility available for every citizen. Every young person as part of his or her education should learn to swim to a reasonable standard. This is essential from a recreational point of view, but more importantly from a safety point of view. Every year we hear of adults or children who drown having fallen into water, be it Dublin's canals or Cork Harbour. A percentage of these deaths could be avoided if the unfortunate individuals involved were able to swim and save themselves. A previous speaker talked about prevention being better than cure, something with which I agree.</P>
      <P>Learning to swim is difficult at the best of times, particularly if one does not start at a young age. Therefore, people need conditions which will make learning how to stay above the surface of the water as painless and as least frightening as possible. People cannot learn how to swim in the sea in Ireland because it is too cold and a person's muscles freeze up if they stay in it for too long. A swimming pool is the only place to master the water initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we as policy makers want to encourage people to swim, we have a responsibility to provide them with adequate facilities and we are not <Col N="1579" /> doing this at present. Public swimming pools, most of which were built in the early or mid-1970s, are in dire need of refurbishment. If evidence is needed of this, one need only look at the Minister's desk which has applications totalling £20 million for public swimming pool refurbishment. This figure will continue to grow. Ireland is now a young, progressive and forward looking country in terms of business, sport and recreation. Swimming is the healthiest sport in which a person can be involved. It is the only sport which exercises every muscle in the body at the same time. A healthy body normally leads to a healthy mind and that is the type of person we want.</P>
    <P>The reason swimming pools received so little attention in recent years is that many private pools and leisure clubs have been built. This is a good thing, but just because there are more pools and leisure facilities does not mean everyone has access to them. Most schools, clubs and young people cannot afford the £600 to £700 or sometimes £900 to £1,000 in annual subscription fees for these private leisure centres. Therefore, the basic need is not being addressed unless public pools are adequately funded. That will cost a great deal of money and some has already been spent in this area. A major part of the problem is that so many pools were built at the same time. Some 48 indoor public pools were built between 1966 and 1974, 32 by local authorities, so they are all due to be repaired at the same time. It is just as well our economy is booming at present and that we are not in a slump. Otherwise, not many people would be swimming in public pools in five to six years' time. Heating systems are breaking down, pools are leaking through cracked tiles and sealant and there is a general cleanliness problem in many public pools, changing rooms and pool areas. This is leading to a spread of infection and fungus, such as verruca. This is hardly the sort of environment which will encourage more young people to use swimming pools.</P>
    <P>Many clubs rely on public swimming pool facilities, such as water polo, scuba diving training, canoeing, aqua aerobics and swimming clubs. These sports are not affordable to a large section of the public if public swimming pools are not accessible to them. The ability to go swimming has the potential to become another classic example of social exclusion. If a person can afford to join a private leisure club, he or she can swim and relax in pristine conditions. If not, he or she will swim in substandard conditions, if they bother to swim at all. That is unacceptable. We should look to countries such as Canada where public pool facilities linked with leisure centres outshine many of the private facilities here. I urge the Minister to look outside the country for examples. There are many in Europe and especially in the United States and Canada.</P>

      <P>I agree with the motion and congratulate the Government. The speech of the <Col N="1580" /> Minister of State, Deputy Flood, was a useful contribution and I welcome the Minister's comments. We should not play party politics with the provision of additional sporting facilities. As anyone who visits other European Union countries readily recognises, there is an infrastructural deficit in Ireland when it comes to the provision of sporting facilities. Nowhere is that more obvious than with swimming pools. We now have an opportunity, because of the revenue in the economy, to provide world class facilities for people who want to swim. Policy in this regard is by and large on the correct footing and it is right the House does not divide on the motion. There is a consensus on both sides of the House on it and I compliment the Minister on that.</P>
      <P>There has been a mushrooming of private health clubs and facilities which are available to people who have £800 or £1,000 in their back pocket to join those clubs for a year. That is not an opportunity afforded to everyone. I represent a constituency where, in the greater Tallaght area, there is one swimming pool for 80,000 people. I do not know of any other place where that would be countenanced and accepted. Some 30 per cent of the population is under 18 years. There is significant deprivation in some of the estates and facilities are needed for young people. Otherwise they will become involved in all kinds of dubious activities. We now have the opportunity to rectify that situation and I hope that will be done in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I welcome the feasibility study to which the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, acceded and for which he announced a grant of £5,000. It will take place in west Tallaght and will examine the feasibility of a swimming pool facility for the area, which has a massive youth population, few public services in which children can engage positively and no pool. I hope the feasibility study will lead to greater things.</P>
      <P>There are too many examples of white elephants where public money has been spent on facilities and, because of changes in the population base, fewer people use the facilities over time. We are all familiar with the community centre white elephants throughout the country. Are we getting value for money from those facilities? Swimming is a popular sport and has a major beneficial effect on people's health, so it should be encouraged. I hope that will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently asked the Minister for the Environment and Local Government how much money the four Dublin local authorities have in their capital accounts. The latest figures available, for 1998, showed they had in excess of £60 million. Why can they not build their own swimming pools if they so choose? It is nonsense that every decision must be approved by the Department of Finance or some other Department. We must move away from that. Where local authorities fortuitously have a substantial amount of resources in their capital accounts, they should be allowed utilise them and build the type of projects to which we refer without seeking approval from <Col N="1581" /> the Department of Finance or going cap in hand to the Minister. If they have the money, they should be allowed build the facilities.</P>

        <b>:</b> I congratulate Deputy Allen for tabling the motion and congratulate the Minister on accepting it. I acknowledge that, even if he had substantially more money than he has, he would still not be able to deal with all the applications he has to hand.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned 23 towns which have submitted applications for swimming pools or for which applications have been approved. I fail to see any mention of Graiguecullen swimming pool which has long been an important place, although it is not a public pool. There was a 33 metre open air swimming pool in Carlow. However, given that Carlow experienced the same kind of summer as the rest of Ireland &ndash; it lasted approximately one week &ndash; it ran at a loss. Two priests who were fed up with the debate to get a swimming pool for the town, including argument on where it would be located and how it would be built, proceeded to have one built. The cost to the State was £100,000 &ndash; a big gesture. It is a magnificent swimming pool, despite what the Minister may be told officially. Fifty schools a week are using it. It is so successful, especially with those learning to swim, that it cannot accommodate swimmers. Fr. Fingleton has arranged in the extension for the insertion of a submersible floor so that invalids can use it.</P>
      <P>When the Minister's backbench colleague thanks a previous Fianna Fáil Minister for allocating £2 million to his constituency towards the provision of a swimming pool and when I read that £1.5 million has been allocated in the form of grants for pools around the country, I place this against the £100,000 we received for our successful pool. In Dickensian English I ask the Minister to please give us more. We in Carlow are entitled to our share. A sum of £100,000 is not an adequate contribution towards building a swimming pool. One county, which is the home of a Minister, has submitted applications for three pools. On the law of averages they will be high on the points system.</P>

        <b>:</b> I accept that technically it does not fall within the remit of the local authority. However, it is doing the work the local authority could not do. Should Carlow be penalised because the local authority failed to provide a pool worthy of the name? Those concerned took over the running of the pool and it is so successful it is overcrowded with the result that it is difficult to swim there unless one goes early in the morning. It is open from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. daily. Is there any other pool in the country run mainly on a voluntary basis that is open those hours? The management has the required <Col N="1582" /> 20 per cent funding to extend the facility as it wishes.</P>
      <P>Carlow deserves more than £100,000 for the funding of a swimming pool. It is an inland county. Seaside towns can get £1.5 million or £2 million to build pools, despite the fact that people can swim in the sea.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne said he would raise the floor; I will raise the roof. I congratulate the former Minister, my constituency colleague Deputy Kenny. Deputy Browne referred to inland and seaside towns not having swimming pools. Westport is surrounded by water, yet three years ago we had no water, swimming pools or anything else. I was delighted to solve the water problem. It never stopped raining over two bad summers, indeed it has not stopped raining since the last general election. We had no proper water supply until the former Minister, Deputy Kenny, allocated a sum of £2.25 million.</P>
      <P>I have been in public life for 20 years. In 1979 I was elected to the urban council. At every election since then, whether it be Dáil, European or local election, the question raised in Westport was why a town its size cannot have a swimming pool, unlike Ballina, Castlebar and other towns. I am delighted to say that next month I hope the Minister will open the new pool. In doing so I hope he will recognise the work Deputy Kenny and I undertook and that the opening ceremony will not be taken over by the Fianna Fáil brigade who did nothing for us but talked when they were in Government.</P>

I congratulate the then chairman of the council, Councillor Patrick Durcan, who initiated the scheme  &ndash; I was a member of the council &ndash; and Pierce O'Malley, President of the Chamber of Commerce, and those who collected the money for the town. Please God the facility will be opened in June.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Allen for moving this motion. It affords us a rare opportunity to debate sport in the House. It also presents the Minster with the opportunity to outline what he is doing for sport, which I acknowledge is considerable.</P>
      <P>The ability to swim is one of the most important skills that any individual can acquire. From a cardiovascular point of view it is highly recommended by all sports specialists, the medical profession and so on. It is also one of the best and safest aerobic exercises and can be participated in by all age groups, from infancy to late adulthood. It is important, therefore, that all our children should have the opportunity to learn how to swim. That is not happening at present.</P>
      <P>I do not know if figures are available, but the percentage of those who can swim properly is low. That is a serious indictment of the education system. If one is able to swim one can take part in a range of water sports and explore the resources along the country's vast coastline. However, there are not enough facilities to ensure that school children can obtain the necessary lessons. That is why so many people who travel abroad cannot swim, why so many get into difficulty and why there are so many fatalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the laughing stock of the world's swimming fraternity by virtue of the fact that we do <Col N="1584" /> not have a 50 metre swimming pool. I suggest the Minister removes that embarrassment as soon as he can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am expressing my view. It is important for the country to have a 50 meter pool as soon as possible. The Minister should look at the hygiene standards in public pools. One of the reasons people are not using public pools and are paying large amounts of money to avail of private facilities is the standard of hygiene. When people pick up a verruca, athlete's foot, etc., from pools and shower facilities which are not cleaned on a regular basis, they are not inclined to go back to them. The Minister should carry out a survey of all public and, indeed, private facilities, to ensure they meet the highest standards of hygiene.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that a number of professional fishermen are unable to swim and do not take life-jackets with them. They are tempting fate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should carry out a national survey to determine the spatial distribution of existing swimming pools and their proximity to the general population, if he has not already done so. It is important to ensure when he is planning for the future that he does not have two or three swimming pools in close proximity to one another and that all the people will get an opportunity to avail of a swimming pool and learn how to swim.</P>
      <P>As a previous speaker mentioned, some swimming pools are running on subventions &ndash; and even then they are running at a loss &ndash; but when you look at the benefit to the community and the reduction in the overall health bill, even running a swimming pool at a loss is worth it and is better than no swimming pool.</P>
      <P>As there is only a £3 million provision this year for the swimming pool programme and it will cost about £20 million to refurbish existing pools, never mind building new pools, I suggest the Minister seek support from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to boost a new programme of pool building throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's short, succinct and factual contribution. He has an enormous opportunity to make a name for himself with the McDaid principles in terms of sport and the provision of facilities for thousands of children and adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the housing boom and the way the economy is moving, in the next ten years there will be a considerable number of applications for private swimming pools and housing. I can see the trend emerging already in many parts of the country. We are talking about local authority pools which are open to the public, the vast majority of whom <Col N="1585" /> will never become members of private swimming clubs or pools.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks, stated that he had two extremely amiable colleagues at the Cabinet table, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. I have a photograph in my office in Castlebar of the 1979 Superstars competition, which I had the privilege of winning, in which the then Deputy Bertie Ahern is climbing over a barrier in the steeplechase, on his way to victory in the political stakes in later years. He has the opportunity to help the Minister to achieve what I want.</P>
    <P>Castlebar swimming pool, for instance, lodged an application for refurbishment at an estimated cost of £1.5 million in 1996. An official of the Department called in February to look at it. The revised cost is just over £2 million. The pool is obviously not included on the list this year because there is only £3 million in the refurbishment programme. The boiler unit of that swimming pool is dilapidated and is literally under serious pressure. Something needs to be done about it. I had thought it might be possible to use the pool in conjunction with the international holiday village, which the Taoiseach opened this year and with which I was involved during my party's term in Government, as an added facility for those who will use that centre for small conferences and for those who will stay in the superior hostel accommodation and houses there.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the general economy. This year the Minister for Finance was able to give away £1 billion in his budget and reduce the national debt by £1 billion and the figures indicate that again there will be a substantial surplus at the end of the current year. In the next few weeks the people will participate in the flotation of Telecom Éireann shares which will bring in at least £1 billion over and above anything else the Exchequer has received. Therefore, if the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are willing to contribute towards the provision of facilities across the board, then there is an ideal opportunity for the Minister to re-present his case for £50 million of that £1 billion to provide the facilities in local authority pools which have been assessed, costed, updated and redesigned, a fact of which the Department will be aware. Fifty million pounds is a small fraction of £1 billion. If the Minister has the ear of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, then this would be the crowning glory of the McDaid Ministry. The Government is heading for a general election, which will probably be next year, so the Minister should do it before then.</P>

      <P>Sometimes it works. I need a swimming pool in Cobh. The pool was closed in 1991 and there is no pool in east Cork. The people have collected almost £400,000, the UDC has provided a site and they are waiting for Government approval to build a pool. Deputy Deenihan spoke of the geographic distribution of pools. This is one area, the southern part of east Cork, which is crying out for a pool. If the Minister gets a chance to look at this I would be grateful.</P>
      <P>Last night I visited the website of the Department and I was expecting something very exciting. I was expecting a list of proposals and speeches. I do not want to say anything too critical because I do not want to upset the Minister &ndash; if I do, he might not give me the pool in Cobh &ndash; but I invite him to look at the number of announcements he has made over the past 12 months which are listed on the website. References to April and May 1998 were the only ones mentioned &ndash; at least that is all I could find. It could do with an upgrade. I was expecting a great deal of information and proposals on swimming but there was nothing. I was disappointed to say the least.</P>
      <P>In addition, from the point of view of attracting tourists the website of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation should be exciting, easy to access and user friendly. In my view, it is not. Perhaps the Minister would take it on himself to visit it and look at it. He should put himself in the position of a tourist and see what he thinks of it. Certainly I learned nothing from it with regard to Government policy on swimming pools and I was disappointed. Having said that, maybe the Minister will still consider providing a swimming pool for Cobh. I do not want to upset him by saying too much which is derogatory or unhelpful. The Minister will have my full support if he fights hard at the Cabinet table for money for swimming. All Members would support him if he built swimming pools throughout the country as part of a millennium project. He should get the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to back him. It is an important issue with many health benefits. I ask the Minister to roll up his sleeves and have a go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a short contribution. I will confine my remarks to the midlands, with particular reference to Counties Offaly and Laois. Special and urgent investment is needed for inland swimming pools in areas where citizens are denied access to swimming facilities. Most midland pools, as the Minister's records will show, are kept open with the help of cake sales and flag days while spanking new pools have been built in coastal towns in recent years as a result of huge capital investment and lotto largesse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for a five year programme of action on midland pools only. The people of Counties Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath are at least one hour from the coast by car and <Col N="1587" /> many do not have access to a local pool. Hotels have opened in many midland towns with leisure centres and pool facilities but these are of no use to the general public as membership costs up to £1,000 per annum. The Minister had the pleasure of opening one in my home town, Portlaoise, recently. It is a fine complex, but, unfortunately, it will only serve a small number of people because of the cost of membership.</P>
    <P>The town pool is located 300 yards from that fine facility and it is in a woeful state. It is run on a shoestring and is likely to close soon because of cutbacks by FÁS. The number of workers there has been reduced from three to one and the pool will not be maintained as a result. That is the problem we have in the midlands.</P>
    <P>The Minister and other colleagues have referred to applications to build swimming pools on restaurant premises. The Minister should get swimming pools in order first before he deals with restaurants. We do not want a restaurant with our pool, we just want a pool with water in it so that the people of Laois and Offaly can learn how to swim and engage in swimming because of the benefits that accrue from it.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Allen for raising this issue, which is important. I want to speak from the point of view of young people. They enjoy nothing more than swimming and nothing is as pleasurable as looking at a group of children paddling or swimming and enjoying themselves. It is an important leisure activity for young people and there must be investment in our youth locally. Not all young people can swim and Deputy Allen raised the need for young people to be engaged in leisure activities, especially in deprived areas where they are often attracted to negative life opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy in the UK is that everybody aged eight years and over should learn how to swim. That policy should be adopted here. In 1998 60 people died accidentally as a result of drowning. The number of young people who committed suicide is not known. However, in 1997, 121 people under 24 years of age committed suicide, of which 17 were under 17. One of the key recommendations in the report of the national task force on suicide which was published in January 1998 was that &ldquo;all children be taught to swim as part of their general education with a view to enhancing health and preventing accidental <Col N="1588" /> drowning as well as suicide&rdquo;. The task force outlined to the Government that every child should be taught to swim as a preventative measure. The majority of people in rural areas do not have the opportunity to learn how to swim. This recommendation has big implications for the Minister's attempts to develop swimming facilities throughout the country. The Government is not interested in children and in ensuring that they have life opportunities and this is a key area which could be developed for them.</P>

      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question two weeks ago about the swimming pool in Longford and the local authority is in contact with the Department about this. Deputy Flanagan's remarks on the midlands are valid and he made his case well. County Longford is the furthest county from the coast and it does not have the same natural facilities as seaside counties. Longford is the county town and the swimming pool has been there since the 1960s. There are many schools in the area &ndash; Ballymahon, Lanesboro and Granard &ndash; and it is only right and proper that the swimming pool is located there.</P>
      <P>Handicapped people also use the pool and it is another good reason for a modern facility in Longford. I will be pleased if the Minister includes the town in his five year plan and puts it high on his list. I wish him well.</P>

The Minister may be aware that 600 children use the swimming pool there daily. It is overused and there was a breakdown at the facility today because of the level of activity in it. A total of 60 organisations use it. I appreciate the Minister has been inundated with lottery applications under the capital facilities programme. However, I would be grateful if he would keep in mind the provision of a new swimming pool in Kilkenny when he makes capital allocations later this year.</P>

Most importantly, they are willing to give up the comfort of their homes for the danger of saving lives at sea. Like the lifeboat servicemen and women of the RNLI, they are willing to put their lives at risk to help people in distress at sea or on our coastline. Where the services of the IMES are required, the volunteers should be provided with the equipment necessary to do their job properly.</P>
    <P>In the event of an emergency in Cork Harbour the IMES, when alerted, is at its station within three minutes. The volunteers are efficient and take their job seriously. However, they are hopelessly ill-equipped. The most difficult resource for a rescue service is the human resource, which is already in place, but how can a marine emergency service, with responsibility for an area the size of Cork Harbour, do its job properly without even a boat?</P>
    <P>When deciding whether investment of this kind is required for this IMES unit, we must look at the demand for the service in the area. Cork Harbour is the centre of marine activity on the south coast but if one looks at a map of the lifeboat stations of Ireland, there is a gap in the Cork region between Ballycotton and Courtmacsherry. This is crazy because Cork Harbour is by far the busiest marine centre in the area. The harbour has a large number of multinational companies on its coastline, gas and oil refining plants, supplied by tankers, international and domestic ferry services, an increasing fishing fleet, and hugely increased sporting activity. On any given weekend in the summer there would be in excess of 1,000 people on the water from Crosshaven alone, between yacht clubs, rowing clubs, diving clubs, fishing, angling, windsurfing, water-skiing, canoeing, etc., as well as a large number of people on beaches and walking on cliffs.</P>
    <P>This IMES unit does not cover Crosshaven alone but also the River Lee, Kinsale and as far as the Seven Heads. The nearest lifeboat station is between 50 and 55 minutes away by sea, at either Courtmacsherry or Ballycotton. The RNLI says it cannot afford a new station in Cork Harbour, so it appears that will not go ahead. The IMES Crosshaven wants a fully equipped in-shore inflatable, which it thinks will cost in the region of £30,000, less than half what the RNLI would spend on a similar craft. This is a modest request which would allow the IMES go to sea when it needs to in a well-equipped vessel.</P>
    <P>It makes a great deal of sense to have such a boat in the harbour area. Numerous relatively minor incidents occur in the harbour and these could be dealt with by the IMES but instead many of them escalate into major incidents which result in the RNLI being called out at great expense. The Government has a responsibility to provide the people of Cork with a decent rescue service. The human resource is already in place, the service has a premises, the volunteers are willing to work and are incredibly dedicated &ndash; I <Col N="1590" /> know many of them personally. All they want is a small investment and they are even willing to accept half the total and to raise the other half themselves.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look sympathetically on this request. I have spent a great deal of time in Cork Harbour and it has never been as busy as it is now. It needs a rescue service. It is not good enough to provide facilities from either Ballycotton or Courtmacsherry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak about the coastal units of the Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, of my Department and compliment Deputy Coveney on the manner in which he presented his case.</P>
      <P>The IMES has 62 full-time staff involved in the management and operation of three co-ordination and communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head, County Donegal and Valentia, County Kerry. It has under its aegis 600 volunteers in 50 coastal units, which are voluntary shore based teams stationed around the coast in strategic locations. They are trained and equipped to respond, on a 24 hour basis, to inshore and offshore incidents. Their equipment includes cliff rescue equipment, area floodlighting search lights, marine communications and fast inflatable and rigid boats.</P>
      <P>At present, eleven of the 50 existing IMES coastal units have rescue boats. These are positioned in locations where boats of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute, RNLI, and of the Community Inshore Rescue Service, CIRS, are not located. IMES liaises closely with these organisations to ensure the most effective use of resources, given the limited funding available.</P>
      <P>The RNLI and CIRS are resources declared and available on call to IMES on a 24 hour basis. The coastal units provide a similar coverage to that provided by the UK Coastguard Auxiliaries and are a store of local knowledge and a cost effective means of shore rescue. They deserve our deepest gratitude and have my sincere admiration for their unstinting voluntary commitment to IMES and to marine search and rescue and marine safety awareness in their local communities. I join Deputy Coveney in thanking those people, who act on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>Since taking office I have initiated a programme of improvement, refurbishment and renewal in coastal unit training, equipment, transport, communications and, recently, premises. In some cases improvements have been brought about by joint commitment, in some areas by joint funding and all are designed to provide the coastal units with the safety, comfort and equipment necessary to carry out their function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to providing funding for an inshore rescue boat for the Cork Harbour or any area, a risk assessment must be carried out, based on incidents in the area. The RNLI is considering placing an Atlantic class inshore rescue boat at Cros<Col N="1591" /> shaven, subject to suitable shore facilities and planning permission for on-shore accommodation for this lifeboat. The RNLI hopes to have the Atlantic class inshore rescue boat in place in the year 2000 with the use of temporary facilities. Being conscious of using resources in the most effective way, I would not consider providing funding for an inshore rescue boat in a location where the RNLI was considering placing one. However, I will monitor events in the area closely.</P>
    <P>The IMES coastal unit at the Old Head of Kinsale has an inflatable boat and the RNLI already has all-weather boats at Ballycotton and Courtmacsherry. I am satisfied with the search and rescue coverage on our coasts. The Cork area is also within easy reach of the IMES helicopter based at Shannon Airport and the Department of Defence helicopter based at Waterford Airport.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the concerns expressed by Deputy Coveney because I live in a coastal area. Every area would like to have its own fully equipped IMES unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sometimes stated that fact can often be stranger than fiction. That observation is true in this case. In 1995 a fisheries officer from the Southern Regional Fisheries Board was called to give evidence at Waterford Circuit Court. A drift net salmon fisherman from Helvick, County Waterford, was before the court on a charge of causing grievous bodily harm to the fisheries officer by striking him with an iron bar. When the fisheries officer entered the witness box, he told the court he could not blame the fisherman for doing what he had done because he and other fishermen living on the Waterford coast had been provoked for many years by a number of the officer's superiors. He stated that it was not surprising that one of them would take such drastic action. Understandably, the presiding judge nearly fell off the bench when the fisheries officer, who four years later is still suffering from the effects of the attack, stated that he did not blame his assailant for his actions which directly resulted from the activities of certain senior fisheries officers in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a period of 15 years prior to that, I had been aware of allegations of corrupt activities on the part of the same senior fisheries officers. In 1990 or 1991, four or five years before the case in question came to court, another fisheries officer rang me and said &ldquo;For God's sake will you do something to stop these thugs and their reign of terror.&rdquo;  He went on to explain that the thugs to whom he referred were his superiors, namely, the <Col N="1592" /> fisheries inspectors who were named in court by the fisheries officer in 1995.</P>
    <P>The Southern Regional Fisheries Board area extends from the Wexford coast, along the Waterford coast and on to Ballycotton. Drift net salmon fishermen working that coast were subjected to a campaign of terror for 15 years and, as the Deputy representing the area, I received continuous complaints from them. If they did not pay bribes for information regarding the departure times of fishing patrols, they were persecuted.</P>
    <P>I conveyed a message from the fisheries officer to a local Garda superintendent in 1991. I informed him that he would need to invite a senior garda, of at least the rank of superintendent, from another investigation to investigate the allegations because the fishermen would not speak to local gardaí owing to their lack of confidence in the judicial system and the forces of law and order. However, nothing was done and no investigation took place until fisheries officer Hickey went to court in 1995. As a result of his allegations, a Garda investigation took place and a court case was put in train but no one was convicted. However, the manager of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board was sacked last year and the two senior fisheries inspectors about whom the allegations were made were dismissed three weeks ago. The fisheries board has not indicated why it saw fit to dismiss these people but we have a right to an explanation.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Ministers for Justice and the Marine in 1991 and passed on the allegations &ndash; I knew them to be true &ndash; made to me by the fisheries officer. However, no action was taken. I request that the House be told why the two fisheries officers were dismissed and that every case with which they were involved between 1980 and 1995 which led to the conviction of drift net salmon fishermen be reviewed. There is a serious suspicion that those cases involved grave miscarriages of justice. I believe the members of the Judiciary who presided over the cases in question were hoodwinked by those inspectors. This is an alarming situation.</P>
    <P>Drift net salmon fishermen working in Counties Waterford, Wexford and Cork will corroborate my story. They will state that people believe grave injustices were visited on good, decent people, a number of whom went to prison, many of whom were assaulted and dozens of whom lost their licences and were never able to put to sea again in order to earn a livelihood. The House must be told why the two officers were dismissed and informed about the action it is proposed to take in connection with the cases with which they were involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I must clarify for the House that the Minister has no direct function in the matter raised by Deputy Deasy. I thank him for raising this matter and I congratulate him on the vigour with which he presented his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> Primary responsibility for this matter lies with the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission which was statutorily appointed in 1996 to take over the protection, conservation and management of the southern board's area. I emphasise that the commission carries out those functions independently of the Minister and the Department and has done so since its establishment. Decisions taken by the commission are a matter for the commission itself. The commission advises the Minister and the Department of decisions it takes and I can confirm that it has advised of the action taken recently in relation to two employees. I am informed that this decision of the commission was taken only after a lengthy and thorough process involving all the parties concerned, including legal representatives.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the commission to administer certain functions of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board was made, under the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, on foot of a report to the Minister which advised that the affairs of the southern board were not being managed in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>The report recommended the appointment of a commission to tackle key strategic problem areas and to assist the board to develop an effective role in future. While the specified functions were transferred to the commission, the board retained responsibility for fisheries and angling development in the region as well as for licensing and fisheries rates.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware the 1995 Act was introduced and passed by the Oireachtas following a review of existing statutory provisions promoted by recurring allegations concerning the southern board.</P>
    <P>For the past three years the commission has been working to systematically tackle and resolve the acknowledged serious difficulties, notably of a staffing nature, in the southern board. The Deputy will be aware considerable progress was made in that time by the commission to address, with all necessary due process, the key problems within the organisation.</P>
    <P>In addition to tackling the organisational difficulties, the commission has been working with the board on salmon and trout management and development strategies for the region, including an enhanced take up of funding for angling projects under the tourism angling measure. The commission and the board have also been to the forefront in developing a catchment management pilot project involving all key players in the Barrow catchment area. The success of this pilot project points the way forward for similar initiatives around the country. Overall, therefore, the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission and Board are working well together and making tangible progress to secure and develop the valuable fisheries resource of the southern region. I can assure the Deputy that all he said tonight will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>All Deputies are aware of the enormous strain economic growth is putting on infrastructure. Through local authorities, demands are being made on a weekly basis of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for new projects to resolve many planning issues, particularly in relation to the need to provide water and sewerage facilities to meet the strict and proper planning conditions laid down by the Department and local authorities. I raise the issue of two schemes in Kilkenny submitted by the local authority to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which are not affected by the infrastructural problems arising from economic growth. Because of their rural nature and the length of terrain involved as a result of the groups coming together, the work on the schemes is very expensive. Kilkenny County Council requires urgent action in terms of an allocation of finance from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to address legitimate concerns expressed over many years about the Lacken-Rathmoyle and Castlewarren group water schemes.</P>
      <P>The council is given an allocation each year under the small schemes programmes for group water and sewerage schemes. This year £200,000 was allocated to Kilkenny County Council to meet its ongoing requirements. Work on these two schemes will cost more than £250,000. The Lacken-Rathmoyle group scheme will cost in the region of £450,000, while the Castlewarren group scheme will cost £300,000. There is a need for a once off financial allocation to meet the cost of these schemes, otherwise the work required cannot be done.</P>
      <P>The voluntary groups and committees involved in these two schemes have done Trojan work in getting permission for rights of way and the provision of reservoirs and tanks, but the provision of reservoirs and tanks and road reinstatement costs under the Department of the Environment and Local Government guidelines are not taken into account in the grant they will receive from the Department. This puts an additional financial burden on the people who will ultimately take up the scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, Kilkenny County Council and the groups involved in these two schemes have not received any financial help under the European Regional Development Fund fund. Allocations from that fund have been made available to other counties. In regard to requests by officials of Kilkenny County Council in recent years, in some instances it was denied that the schemes could be funded from the European Regional Development Fund and in others, when it was accepted that the funds were available, there was no clear indication that Kilkenny County Council would be rewarded with any allocation from that fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> There is great concern among the local communities of Lacken-Rathmoyle and Castlewarren about the work required in respect of two expensive rural schemes. There are 82 houses and 72 farms involved in Lacken and 54 houses and farms involved in Castlewarren. A well drilling source is required by the local community for Castlewarren, but the source is already available from Kilkenny Corporation for the Lacken-Rathmoyle schemes.</P>
    <P>The community living in Castlewarren had to draw water in February and March. They did not have a proper water supply during the spring or winter months. That has been a recurring problem over many years.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to indicate his interest in these two schemes and to ensure additional finance is allocated for schemes such as these that cost more than £250,000. As the county council cannot provide the resources for these schemes, we must depend on the Department to do so. We are dependent on the goodwill of the Minister of State and the Minister in respect of an allocation of national funds.</P>
    <P>If money is not available for both schemes, it would be helpful if the Minister would allow the county council to charge interest on a loan that could be procured for the purpose of allowing one scheme to go ahead this year or the second scheme could be completed on that basis. A loan could be raised by the council and the interest charged could be given to the council from the Department. In that way a commitment would be given to provide the money to meet such a loan and the cost of a scheme next year. These two schemes have been on the stocks for a while and work on them is urgently required to ensure the provision of a good quality and reliable water supply. As we enter the next millennium, that is a basic human right and facility to which people are entitled, but the problem facing the people concerned is an expensive one to resolve. I appeal to the Minister of State to assist the Minister in the process sooner rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for raising this matter. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and has asked me to do so on his behalf. The Deputy can be assured that because of the close relationship between Wexford and Kilkenny he will have my support on this. It may be the only support he will have this summer from a Wexford man.</P>
      <P>While the Department of the Environment and Local Government has no specific proposals from Kilkenny County Council on these schemes and no direct function in them, I will clarify how the group water scheme and rural water programme is operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has endeavoured to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of rural water <Col N="1596" /> supplies. In doing so, he has recognised and strengthened the role of the private group scheme sector and set up the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee to advise on policy matters and to monitor the implementation by local authorities of the range of capital grant measures within the rural water programme.</P>
    <P>He has introduced new measures aimed specifically at tackling the water quality problems confronting privately sourced group schemes. He has also introduced record levels of funding for rural water. Capital investment in 1999 will amount to £28.6 million, an increase of more than £7 million on last year's figure. Kilkenny has benefited substantially from this increased investment. The 1999 block grant, notified to Kilkenny County Council in March for the devolved rural water programme amounted to £428,500 &ndash; not £200,000, as the Deputy stated &ndash; compared to £254,000 in 1998.</P>
    <P>Under the devolved rural water programme, it is a matter for the local authorities to prioritise the projects they want to approve, subject to the block grant limit. As part of the Department's assessment of this year's block grant requirements, local authorities were asked to submit details of their proposed multi-annual programmes of work under the devolved programme. In that context, Kilkenny County Council indicated that the Lacken-Rathmoyle scheme should proceed in 1999, while the Castlewarren scheme should proceed in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99, provides approximately £10 million from the European Regional Development Fund &ndash; to assist in the development of certain largescale group water schemes. Last week, in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Hogan inquiring about the possibility of European Regional Development Fund funding for these schemes, the Minister advised that costings associated with projects already approved for European Regional Development Fund co-financing were being assessed. He also said that in the event &ndash; it is a fairly unlikely event &ndash; of any balance of uncommitted European Regional Development Fund funds becoming available as a result of this assessment, consideration would be given to approving further schemes. There is, however, no application for European Regional Development Fund co-financing on file in this case from Kilkenny County Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this issue which, when I submitted it, was extremely urgent. It was raised in the context that tomorrow the 150 traffic wardens who are employed by the Minister would effectively be off his payroll. I thank the Minister for responding to pleas from my party leader, deputy leader and myself to postpone the decision in order to allow <Col N="1597" /> talks to take place. The situation remains a critical one from the point of view of the traffic wardens. In many cases they have given many long years of service, yet find themselves in no man's land, unwanted by the Department that originally employed them and unwelcomed by Dublin Corporation to which they are being dispatched.</P>
      <P>There are merits in centralising all the traffic functions. Indeed, I have argued for it many times. However, the traffic services which will be centralised, and for which local authorities will have to pay from their own resources, must reflect the current traffic needs of the Dublin area. Any service that does not meet these needs is both pointless and wasteful. If local government is to mean anything it must be able to identify its own needs and responses to them, which are effective and efficient and target the problems.</P>
      <P>Dublin has changed over the years as have its traffic problems and so have the solutions, both in their nature and scale. None of this, however, is the fault of the traffic wardens. They did the job they were employed to do and did it well. They were loyal employees of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If their services are no longer needed, it is through no fault of their own. The Department has a moral and legal obligation to face up to the implications of that fact. It should not pass the problem on to be resolved by somebody else, particularly not to Dublin Corporation which has no responsibility in the matter. It is degrading and demeaning to a group of loyal workers who do not deserve to be forced into a situation of changing their employer and conditions of employment and who are being passed around like a hot potato that nobody wants. It is an unacceptable way for any employer to treat workers. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have the courage and the courtesy, to which the wardens are entitled, to deal fairly and honestly with them. Their demands are by no means extravagant. All they want is either to be redeployed within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which employed them originally &ndash; from what I hear, the carriage office could do with more resources &ndash; or, alternatively, to be offered an acceptable severance package. Such a package should be offered by the Department which employed them, not by another agency that has no real responsibility for them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response to our request for an extension of the proposed transfer date, to allow some space for a package to be agreed. I hope the Minister will avail of this window of opportunity to deal with the traffic wardens quickly rather than prolonging the stress which the uncertainty is causing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this matter remains unresolved, the Dublin local authorities are inhibited from developing their parking regulation enforcement measures which would be appropriate to today's needs. Maximising the use of our street space and maintaining traffic flows are critical to main<Col N="1598" /> taining Dublin's viability as our capital city, against a background of increased car usage, growing congestion and deficient public transport. Dublin's local authorities recognise and wish to have a flexible, mobile and multi-functional core to regulate parking, particularly along the new quality bus corridors, at critical junctions in urban villages, town centres and in residential areas. It is becoming more important to regulate parking because of the emergence of new quality bus corridors, LUAS and the DART lines.</P>
    <P>It may well be that many of the existing traffic wardens, with experience and skills that have been built up over the years, would and could take up these jobs, but they cannot be forced to do so. Likewise, local authorities should not be placed in a position where they cannot choose whom they employ or their conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to bring this message to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address the concerns of the traffic wardens who are, after all, pawns in a debacle which is not of their making. The Minister should come to an acceptable arrangement with them that would allow both sides to extricate themselves with some dignity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for putting her case strongly but also very reasonably. I apologise for the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is unable to be in the House. He has asked me to deliver a reply on his behalf.</P>
      <P>As the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, outlined to the House in his reply to Deputy Haughey on this subject on Thursday, 1 April 1999, the transfer of the traffic warden service to Dublin Corporation gives effect to a Government decision of 26 July 1995 which gives responsibility for traffic management to Dublin Corporation. This was recommended to Government by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government as part of the Dublin Transportation Initiative plan for Dublin. This plan recommended the appointment by Dublin Corporation of a director of traffic who would take over responsibility from the Garda Síochána for traffic wardens, on-the-spot fines and tow away services, introduce wheel clamping and have overall responsibility for traffic management in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>The progress on the implementation of the Government decision is as follows. A director of traffic was appointed by Dublin Corporation in April, 1997 and wheel clamping was introduced by Dublin Corporation in summer 1998. Dublin Corporation took over responsibility for the tow-away service in September 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister outlined to the House on 1 April, 1999, all 143 traffic wardens currently employed by the Garda Commissioner will transfer to Dublin Corporation. They are State industrial employees and can therefore be transferred within the public sector. They are being trans<Col N="1599" /> ferred with the functions they discharge to a local authority, i.e. Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that this transfer will bring the Dublin metropolitan area into line with the rest of the State whereby local authorities employ traffic wardens under the Local Government (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975.</P>
    <P>With regard to concerns regarding the pay and conditions of traffic warden on transfer, prolonged and intensive negotiations have taken place under the PCW agreement between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Finance, Dublin Corporation and the two unions representing the traffic wardens, IMPACT and SIPTU. Joint proposals have been put to the unions by the Commissioner, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Dublin Corporation which offer the traffic wardens enhanced pay and conditions on transfer. I understand the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is still awaiting the unions' decision to ballot on these proposals.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the terms and conditions of employment of the traffic wardens with Dublin Corporation, including the issue of any potential voluntary redundancies, are solely matters for the corporation as their future employer. I also emphasise that the PCW proposals offer the traffic wardens enhanced pay and conditions over and above what they currently enjoy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> Transfer dates which were previously set were changed to allow the unions seek further clarification from Dublin Corporation on their PCW proposals. A recent development in this matter is that the Labour Relations Commission has invited the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend a conciliation conference to address the unions' difficulties regarding the transfer. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform considers that all outstanding matters in so far as its own proposals are concerned have been resolved. The Department has indicated that full consideration will be given to the LRC request should the circumstances warrant it at a later stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the date of transfer, it was anticipated that the traffic wardens would report directly to Dublin Corporation on 29 April 1999. However, as the administrative arrangements have yet to be completed, the Garda Commissioner and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have agreed that the traffic wardens will report to their respective Garda stations on that date. A letter will issue to each traffic warden shortly with regard to the final transfer arrangements. The Minister understands that a meeting of the unions and the traffic wardens was due to take place this afternoon to discuss the issues further.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 April 1999.</P>

      <P>Following the meetings with the main parties I held jointly with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair last week, and our conference calls with the parties in Belfast, a round-table meeting was held in Belfast aimed at breaking the current impasse. This followed on meetings that had taken place on a bilateral and multilateral basis at official level involving the pro-Agreement parties. The two Governments and the parties explored a range of strategies about how to make progress. The talks, which were jointly hosted by Minister of State Liz O'Donnell and Minister Adam Ingram, were useful and all the parties are focused on the priority objective &ndash; the establishment of the Executive.</P>
      <P>I met with the Sinn Féin President, Mr Gerry Adams last Saturday. Mr Adams and I reviewed the situation with regard to how best to progress the implementation of the Agreement. As a result of the meeting, I am satisfied that the leadership of Sinn Féin remain committed to finding a way through the current difficulties on the basis of securing a sufficiently wide consensus.</P>
      <P>The dialogue is continuing this week and on Monday Minister of State O'Donnell and Minister Paul Murphy met a number of the parties in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the discussions that have taken place, I and relevant colleagues are considering how best to now make progress towards the priority objective. We will be reviewing the situa<Col N="1602" /> tion with our British counterparts and with the parties. In that context, the Prime Minister and I agreed, on the telephone, to meet with all the pro-Agreement parties next week in London.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present to contact President Clinton but close contact is, of course, being maintained with the United States Administration at other levels.</P>

      <P>The Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Brian Tobin and Mrs. Tobin, visited Ireland last week. The main purpose of the Premier's visit was to lead a business mission to Ireland. He was accompanied by his Ministers for Industry, Trade and Technology and Justice and Finance.</P>
      <P>The business mission took place pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding concluded between the Government of Ireland and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1996. This Memorandum of Understanding was concluded during the period of office of the administration headed by Deputy John Bruton, in recognition of the fact that this province of Canada has the highest proportion of people of Irish descent of any area of settlement world-wide, and because of the commonalties and the potential for mutual benefit for the two participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mission was organised by Ireland Business Partnerships which were set up in Newfoundland by Premier Tobin to implement the Memor<Col N="1603" /> andum of Understanding. It was done in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs, with considerable input from Enterprise Ireland. The mission, which also involved the St. John's Board of Trade, included a wide range of companies with a particular focus on information technology, environmental technologies, tourism and film-making. Pre-matching of companies had taken place so that each company had a tailored itinerary of focused meetings in pre-identified areas, in numerous locations around the country, including Galway, Waterford, Cork and of course Dublin.</P>
    <P>I hosted breakfast for the Premier and senior members of his delegation on Monday 19 April. I reiterated to them the commitment I gave when I took up office in 1997 to continue to progress the objectives of the Memorandum of Understanding.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 21 April, I hosted a state reception at Dublin Castle for the Premier, the visiting business delegation and those on the Irish side with whom they are now discussing or doing business. Prior to the reception, the Premier and I signed a reaffirmation of the Memorandum of Understanding. A number of business deals and agreements between Irish companies and organisations and companies from Newfoundland and Labrador were also signed at that time. I am also informed that following on from the week long intensive series of meetings between Newfoundland and Irish companies, a number of further significant agreements are likely to result to the benefit of both sides.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the Premier, I undertook to support a strong reciprocal business mission to Newfoundland &ndash; probably later this year. It is envisaged that this mission will be led by the Minister of State with responsibility for international trade, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
    <P>The feedback from the businesses participating in the delegation was very positive. Premier Tobin himself was delighted with the outcome of the mission which he described as the most successful business mission by a Newfoundland and Labrador delegation to any destination ever.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the high priority which I attach to the schemes of grant aid for the control of farm pollution and for the improvement of dairy hygiene standards, an additional £25 million from the Exchequer has been provided for the on-farm investment schemes in my Departments Estimates for 1999. This funding allows for the introduction of nationally funded schemes for the control of farm pollution and the improvement of dairy hygiene in a more focused form, better targeted towards those farmers most in need of assistance. This is in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the farming organisations on the eligibility criteria for the new schemes and examination of their written submissions, my Department has submitted the terms of the new schemes, which are regarded as State aids, for approval to the European Commission.

      <P>The financial outcome of the Agenda 2000 CAP reform as finalised by the European Council on 24 to 26 March will mean an estimated overall gain of £395 million to farm income in Ireland over the period 2000-6. The national gain over the period will be even greater &ndash; £666 million &ndash; because of the additional benefits from lower product prices.</P>
      <P>The financial situation for grain growers has been estimated at a loss of £10.6 million in the year 2000 and at £18.7 million in each of the years 2001-6. The overall financial loss to grain growers for the period has been estimated at £122.6 million. This compared with the outcome for beef and milk which resulted in gains of £325 million and £192 million respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The losses for grain were calculated on the basis that market prices will fall to the full extent of the 15 per cent reduction in the inter<Col N="1606" /> vention price. However, most analysts predict that this is not likely to happen due to an expected upturn in world prices. The reinstatement of a positive rate of set-aside of 10 per cent under the Berlin agreement should act as a further influence on price buoyancy in the EU and on world markets. If these price forecasts prove to be correct then the losses referred to will be significantly reduced and could even be eliminated.</P>

      <P>Paratuberculosis, otherwise known as Johnes Disease in cattle, is caused by Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and is a notifiable disease under the Johnes Disease Order, 1955. This Order also provides for the slaughter of an animal infected with or suspected of being infected with Johnes Disease and for the prohibition of movement of animals from land or premises where the disease exists.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the milk quota system in Ireland takes account of the needs of small scale producers. A number of specific measures have been introduced and continue to operate to address the problems of these producers. The milk quota restructuring scheme gives total priority to small scale producers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons. Since the introduction of the scheme, over 130 million gallons have been restructured. Under the temporary leasing scheme 75 per cent of the pool is made available to producers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons. Approximately 59 million gallons were temporary leased in the 1997-8 scheme. Producers with quotas of less than 35,000 gallons get priority in the redistribution of unused quotas or flexi-milk at the end of each milk quota year. They are allocated 70 per cent of the available quota under this measure. The effect of the ring-fencing of quota in disadvantaged areas and the clawback of quota on land leases and sales is very much in favour of small scale producers. The milk quota appeals tribunal adjudicates on cases of hardship and over the years, on their recommendation, quota has been allocated to many applicants, mostly small scale producers. Statistics on small scale producers leasing additional quota are not available in the format requested.</P>
      <P>The detailed negotiations on the proposal for a council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 on the milk quota regime have not yet been concluded. In the context of these negotiations, and also in the context of any revision of quota schemes within the competence of national legislation, I will continue to have full regard to the specific needs of small scale producers.</P>

      <P>Following the decision of Iran to reopen its market to imports of beef from Ireland all of the traditionally important markets for Irish beef are now open. As regards live cattle, despite the fact that to date Libya has not yet honoured the agreement to resume imports from Ireland, exports have recorded a major increase in the first three months of this year substantially exceeding the same period last year.</P>
      <P>My priorities are to continue to seek to have the agreement reached with Libya honoured and to focus on some of the secondary markets where market access problems persist. These markets include Turkey, Jordan, Tunisia and Syria. One of the major marketing priorities for the Irish beef industry is to increase the level of beef exports to the high value EU markets and thereby assist in reducing the gap between Irish and EU cattle prices.</P>
      <P>Since the BSE crisis the volume of Irish exports to EU markets has declined due to a fall in consumption but also due to a preference on some of those markets for their own, domestically produced, beef. This market renationalisation has been further reinforced by the beef labelling regulations adopted in 1997. The beef task force, which I have established, is examining this matter in the context of an action plan for the whole industry, right through from primary production through to processing and marketing. I am expecting the task force to complete its report very shortly.</P>

      <P>Since its establishment just over five years ago, An Bord Bia has consistently striven to access and exploit every viable market for Irish food and drink products. A measure of the success of this organisation is the fact that Irish exports of food and drink in 1998 reached an all time high of over £5 billion.</P>
      <P>Participation at the International Green Week in Berlin is but one of the strategies the board has undertaken to promote Irish food products on export markets. This event is recognised as the largest consumer food fair in the world and in 1999, it was attended by over 483,000. As well as providing an important opportunity to showcase Irish food and drinks to an international audience, green week is a significant forum for the agri-food industry and also provides valuable public relations opportunities. This year's event was particularly useful in that it coincided with the return of the seat of Government to Berlin and marked the beginning of the German Presidency of the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Important measures to alleviate the problems in the pig sector have already been taken by me. In September 1998 I succeeded in gaining agreement from the EU Commission for the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme, under which EU funding is provided for the storage of pigmeat for a maximum period of six months. The scheme is still running and to date over 285,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been temporarily removed from the market throughout the Community. Ireland has over 2,000 tonnes of pigmeat in storage under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I also secured substantial increases on a number of occasions in the level of export refunds, including an increase of 75 per cent for certain pigmeat cuts to Russia. The latest of these increases came in February 1999 when I secured an export refund increase ranging from 47 per cent to 80 per cent for certain processed products for the Russian market. These increases have been of considerable help to exporters.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with a number of other member states, I am continuing to press for further EU action to help the situation for producers. This action includes improved market support as well as measures related to supply control. The issue was raised at a recent meeting of the pigmeat management committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has already been made in resolving the difficulties in regard to capacity and I am now satisfied that there is adequate capacity to deal with the available throughput. While by no means satisfactory, there has been an improvement in pigmeat prices and I am hopeful that this trend will continue. I will continue to urge the Commission to make greater use of the instruments at its disposal under the common organisation of the market, namely export refunds and the aid to private storage scheme. I <Col N="1611" /> have the support of a considerable number of member states in this approach.</P>

      <P>The new extensification premium payments system which was adopted under the Agenda 2000 agreement last month by the Council of Ministers provides for the payment of two rates of premium payments on animals which have qualified for the suckler cow and special <Col N="1612" /> beef premium, provided they meet new stocking rate criteria. They represent a considerable improvement on the original Commission proposals which contained restrictive stocking density conditions and which it is estimated would have excluded some one third of those producers currently claiming extensification premia. The stocking rate calculation will be based on all cattle on the farm over six months including the number of ewes on which ewe premiums applications have been made. Under the existing extensification premium arrangements only bovine animals on which applications for the suckler cow and special beef premium have been made, the milk quota held by the producer and the number of ewes on which applications for the ewe premium have been made are taken into consideration in measuring stocking density.</P>
      <P>The new extensification premium will come into force next year with the premiums increasing each year up to 2002. The rates of payment are as follows:</P>

    <P>Member states will also have the option of implementing the Commission's original proposal under Agenda 2000 which provides for higher levels of premium payments under more restrictive stocking density rules, that is 100 euro per head where stocking density is under 1.4 LU/Ha. We will not be applying this option.</P>
    <P>The detailed rules for the application of the new extensification premium have yet to be adopted by the Commission. Our aim will be to ensure that they will be as practicable as possible for producers.</P>

      <P>My Department is addressing the problem of overgrazing by sheep on commonages through an improved package of measures under the rural environment protection scheme. It was clear that supplementary measure 2 of the REP scheme which was geared towards the regeneration of areas overgrazed by sheep was not having the desired effect. In order to address this issue my Department negotiated the introduction of a new supplementary measure under the scheme entitled Supplementary Measure A &ndash; SMA. Under this measure farmers with commonage land will only be eligible for headage, sheep premia and suckler cow premia payments if they farm in accordance with the conditions of an agri-environmental plan under REPS or a scheme to be drawn up by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The revised REPS specifications to provide for supplementary measure A were recently published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for all commonage land which will set out the level of destocking which might be required to achieve the regeneration of overgrazed lands. It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages. However, it is expected that the first <Col N="1613" /> plan will be completed within the next couple of weeks. These plans will quantify the position in relation to overgrazing on commonages</P>
    <P>Pending the availability of commonage framework plans, my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have put an interim national commonage framework plan in place. The interim plan involved a destocking equivalent to 30 per cent of mountain ewes for flock holders who use commonage in six counties, Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, that is those counties identified as having overgrazed commonages.</P>
    <P>Enhanced rates of compensation are available to farmers in the target areas under supplementary measure A for farming in accordance with the requirements of an agri-environmental plan. I am confident this new measure will be successful in combating the problem of overgrazing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Libya and Egypt are the only traditional markets for live cattle which are not at present importing cattle from Ireland. The nature of the Egyptian market has changed for Ireland. In 1998, Egypt became the largest market for Irish beef accepting the equivalent of over 300,000 head of cattle. As regards Libya, agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation last July last providing for the re-opening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts. This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997. The Libyan Government, through the General Peoples Committee, formally cleared the agreement before the end of September and written confirmation to this effect was received.</P>
      <P>Although the Libyan authorities indicated their wish to have the agreement implemented immediately, there have been delays in the conclusion of contracts for Irish cattle. These delays are of serious concern both to myself and the Government. Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities, through every possible channel, with a view to ensuring that the July agreement is implemented in practice. Our position is that an official agreement has been reached with the Libyan authorities and that it should be honoured.</P>
      <P>Exports of live cattle from Ireland are continuing at significant levels. To date exports of almost 100,000 head have been reached which is a major increase on the level of 34,469 head exported in the same period in 1998. Live cattle exports in 1998 had recorded a major increase on 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>Greyhound breeding and rearing are an integral part of rural life in Ireland where these activities are primarily carried on by the farming community. The greyhound sector has been supported by my Department as an alternative farming enterprise.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme of early retirement from farming, participants must undertake to cease all commercial farming activity definitively. In this context and, given that the greyhound breeding and rearing are acceptable alternative farming enterprises under other Department schemes, these activities cannot be engaged by the participants in the scheme of early retirement from farming. I have arranged an examination of all aspects related to the keeping of greyhounds and the implications for the operation of the scheme of early retirement from farming. Arising from that review I can accept that the keeping of greyhounds as a leisure pursuit and hobby by the participants in the scheme can be permitted. However, the breeding and rearing of greyhounds by early retirement participants is not allowed.</P>

      <P>The position is that Ireland's performance in delivering the direct payment schemes is among the best in the EU and compares very favourable with that of other member states. For most schemes Ireland rated between one and five among the 15 member states in terms of early payment in the 1997-98 scheme year. Ireland was first in the arable and ewe premium schemes, third in the suckler cow scheme and fifth in the special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that considerable progress has been made in keeping documentation as simple as possible for these schemes. Application forms and helpsheets have been simplified each year in consultation with the farming bodies. In a recent oral presentation to the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Strategic Management Initiative, the European Commission indicated that the forms used in Ireland were easier to understand than those used by other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Direct payments to farmers constituted some 56 per cent of farmers income in 1998 and this proportion is set to increase in the coming years <Col N="1617" /> following from the successful outcome of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. It is my objective that the improvements in delivery of these payments which have been achieved in recent years are built on and that the service provided by my Department to farmers is efficient, fair, friendly and transparent.</P>

      <P>The report of the advisory group on quarantine, established by the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, recommended in September 1998 that, for cats and dogs travelling between Great Britain and the member states of the European Union, the European economic area or rabies free islands, the quarantine system should be replaced by a system involving vaccination, blood testing, identification and certification. Following a period of public consultation, these recommendations have been accepted by the UK Government. The UK Agriculture Minister recently announced the objective of bringing new arrangements into operation throughout the UK by April 2001 and the intention of running a pilot scheme or schemes within the next twelve months. Various aspects of the operation and implementation of the new arrangements have yet to be settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the common approach to rabies adopted by both Ireland and the UK over a period of many years, any changes which might be made to the UK system of quarantine controls would have a potentially significant impact on Ireland.

I will, in due course, make specific recom<Col N="1619" /> mendations to Government in relation to the approach which Ireland should adopt.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there is sufficient capacity both slaughtering and processing in the pigmeat industry to meet current demands.</P>
      <P>With regard to the north east region, there was pressure some months ago on slaughtering capacity there due to a fire at a pigmeat plant in Ballymoney, County Antrim. A backlog of pigs awaiting slaughter built up in the border region, which has now been cleared with the co-operation of EU approved pigmeat plant owners who between them increased the weekly kill by about 8,000 pigs per week.</P>
      <P>In addition the McCarren plant in County Cavan was re-opened in October last, and slaughterings there are on the increase. I also gave EU export status to two slaughtering plants, one in County Meath and the other in County Westmeath which helped the north eastern region also.</P>
      <P>In December 1998 EU approved pigmeat plants in one particular week killed 78,000 pigs. Slaughterings at the beginning of this year averaged 73,000 pigs per week while current slaughterings are averaging around 67,000.

      <P>Since 1981 the EU beef carcase classification system has been used to determine the grades of cattle slaughtered in the EU. The system, which is based on the EUROP grid, determines conformation and fat score levels of each carcase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a deterioration in the grades of Irish cattle as measured on this EU classification <Col N="1622" /> system over the past five years. There has been a drop in the conformation standards and increases in fat levels. At this point in time, less than 20 per cent of our finished cattle are suitable for the premium segments of the European market. A number of factors have contributed to this development of which the flat pricing payment system operated by meat processors over the last number of years is the most significant. Other factors which have also contributed to the deterioration in the grades are the increasing use of the Holstein breed in the dairy herd, use of poor quality breeds in the building up of the suckler cow herd which has increased by some 40 per cent since the 1992 CAP reform agreement. The low level of live trade to third countries over the past three years has also contributed to the deterioration in grading standards as these markets traditionally took poorer quality finished cattle.</P>

      <P>While the scope of the report will, therefore cover the full range of activity in the sector from the farmgate to the consumer it is clear that for the plan to succeed, it is essential that producers must be adequately rewarded for high quality production.

Details of each consignment of animals imported are required to be sent in advance to the local Department of Agriculture and Food office in the county of destination through the EU Animal Notification System.</P>
      <P>A bi-lateral arrangement exists between this Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland in respect of sheep going to and from Northern Ireland. Under the arrangement, sheep of Northern Ireland origin may move freely into the Republic and <i>vice versa. </i>No animal health certificates are required for such trade and no ANIMO notifications are sent.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a copy of <Col N="1624" /> the submission referred to by the Deputy from the Agricultural and Horticultural Colleges Association.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of educational and training services in agriculture rests with Teagasc under section 4 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988. In conformity with this provision, it is a matter for Teagasc to assess the funding requirements of the colleges and, similarly, Exchequer funding for the colleges is channelled through Teagasc.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has made a submission to my Department seeking funding over a five year period to meet the capital development needs of all the agricultural training facilities, including the private colleges. However, as these needs will be influenced by the level of future demand for training, Teagasc, at my request, commissioned a study last autumn to establish the likely level of such demand. I will give this matter further consideration on receipt of the views of the Teagasc authority on the study which I hope to receive in the near future.</P>

      <P>Within my Department, responsibility for the overall development of the food industry, including marketing, has been assigned to the food division, which has been in existence since 1987.</P>
      <P>There are 14 people employed in the food division. Their responsibilities cover implementing and co-ordinating the various measures under the current development strategy &ndash; the food sub-programme, overseeing the activities of An Bord Bia and the administration of various EU regulatory requirements. In carrying out its tasks, the food division liaises closely with other divisions within the Department and with those State agencies involved in the development of the food industry. This ensures a co-ordinated and cohesive approach to the industry's development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking account of adjustments made in the mid-term review of structural funds, the food sub-programme provides for a total investment of £586 million over the 1994 to 1999 period. This includes £250 million in public funds. The progress to date under the sub-programme has been very satisfactory. Within the last five years, output has increased by £2.2 billion and exports by £1 billion. There has been particularly strong growth in the high value consumer foods and <Col N="1625" /> food ingredients segments. Such progress reflects well on the integrated nature of the sub-programme and on the synergy which exists between my Department and relevant State agencies.</P>
    <P>The food industry development group, which was established under the aegis of my Department, has formulated a proposed action plan for future development. The group's report is a comprehensive one and its recommendations are based on a detailed analysis of recent performance and likely future opportunities and challenges. That report is being borne in mind in the ongoing discussions on the new national development plan and the next round of structural funds.   </P>

      <P>Middle East countries are major market outlets for the Irish cattle and beef industry. Also, the nature of the trade has changed over the past two years.</P>
      <P>To date in 1999, exports of live cattle, all of which have been consigned to Lebanon, have amounted to 20,903 head. This compares with 6,678 exported to that market in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Beef exports to the Middle East region have substantially increased. During the first quarter of this year, Egypt and the Gulf states are estimated to have purchased over 30,000 tonnes of Irish beef which in terms of cattle equivalent amounts to about 100,000 head. Last year Egypt was the largest single market for Irish beef, importing the equivalent of over 300,000 cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The deadline of 13 May 1999 refers to the date set by an arbitrator by which the EU is to bring the hormone ban fully into conformity with the findings of a WTO panel, as amended by the WTO appellate body. The EU has been endeavouring to comply with the WTO findings and in this regard has commissioned 17 scientific studies in relation to the hormones in question. The difficulty is, however, that the full results of <Col N="1626" /> all the studies will not be available by the deadline already referred to.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, the European Commission has been engaged in discussions with the US authorities with a view to averting the imposition by the US of threatened retaliatory measures against EU exports to that country. These discussions centre around compensation for the US and/or allowing access to the EU market of US hormone treated beef labelled as such, pending the availability of the full scientific evidence from the studies referred to above.</P>
      <P>I can support a solution to this issue which avoids a damaging trade war with the US, while at the same time continuing to provide protection to consumers in the European Union who do not wish to consume hormone treated beef.</P>

      <P>The policy paper on forestry and the national heritage, prepared by The Heritage Council, sets out in clear terms their position in relation to forestry. There are many positive aspects with which I am in agreement, for example the introductory statement that &ldquo;Forestry has considerable potential to enhance Ireland's biological and landscape diversity, to offer aesthetic and amenity benefits while at the same time safeguarding our existing heritage and providing real economic benefit to communities&rdquo; and recommendations that: promote the better matching of species and site; support sustainable forest management; and promote greater local participation.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a number of generalisations and statements from which the Heritage Council draws conclusions and inferences which differ from the Government's programme. For example, a recommended target of 50:50 planting of broadleaves and conifers, compared with the Government target of 20:80, appears to be unsupported either biologically or economically and does not take into account the basic site requirements of broadleaf species.</P>
      <P>Recommendations relating to increased control and planning of afforestation also fail to take into account the Forest Service approach which is based on a combination of sustainable forest management principles, national standards, indicative forest strategies and local participatory frameworks.</P>
      <P>The Forest Service recently had initial discussions with the Heritage Council in relation to the policy paper. Further discussions are being held.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that some inaccurate public statements have been made about the applicability of various sections of the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill to mobile phone infrastructure and I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>Section 7(2) of the Bill allows network operators to apply to the telecommunications infrastructure board for an order to compulsorily acquire a right over land for the establishment and maintenance of fixed telecommunications infrastructure, that is, infrastructure for the provision of fixed telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>The definition of fixed telecommunications infrastructure in section 2 refers to the conveyance of signals &ldquo;between defined fixed termination points&rdquo;. A mobile phone is not a fixed termination point and, therefore, there is no provision for the compulsory acquisition of a right over land under section 7 to establish and maintain antennae or antennae support structures for mobile telephony.</P>
      <P>Apart from these provisions regarding compulsory acquisition of rights over land, one of the other purposes of the Bill is to encourage the sharing of infrastructure by operators, both fixed and mobile.</P>
      <P>The Bill recognises, in the first instance, that infrastructure sharing is a matter for commercial negotiation among network operators. The Bill provides for the intervention by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation in disputes among network operators concerning sharing of infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not exclude the possibility that infrastructure established along a right of way compulsorily acquired by a fixed network operator could be shared with a mobile telephony operator. However, in many cases, the location requirements of fixed and mobile operators are different.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in the event of an agreement between a fixed operator and a mobile operator to share infrastructure along a compulsorily acquired right of way, the installation of any additional infrastructure may be governed by the terms and conditions of the acquisition order relating to the right of way or by the requirements of existing planning legislation which are not affected by the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I have introduced a range of measures to alleviate the difficulties which some sectors of agriculture faced over the past year as a result of inclement weather and the loss of international markets.</P>
      <P>These included: arranging for speedy payment of over £1,038 million in respect of headage, premia and other direct income payments to farmers in 1998; achieving substantially increased export refunds for beef; gaining increased and improved access to beef intervention; approving additional facilities for live exports of cattle; successfully negotiating substantial increases in the amounts of export refunds for pigmeat; providing over £40 million towards alleviation of fodder difficulties; introduction of the farm assist scheme to provide income supplements to farmers on low incomes; successfully negotiating a substantially improved position for Irish farmers under the Agenda 2000 in which a potential loss of £1,386 million over the seven year period 2000 to 2006 was converted to an estimated gain of £395 million.</P>
      <P>These measures substantially reduced the hardship which would otherwise have been faced by farmers. The Agenda 2000 agreement will provide a solid basis for the development of the agri-food sector in the years ahead but I will, of course, continue to monitor the situation carefully and will take whatever further actions are appropriate.</P>

      <P>The criteria under which member states may pay state aid are set down in article 92 of the EU Treaty. In general terms, any aid granted by a member state or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between member states, be incompatible with the common market.</P>
      <P>Member states wishing to introduce state aid are obliged to notify the EU Commission beforehand.</P>
      <P>I am aware that France has recently announced a package of aid for pig producers there, but I understand the package has not begun operating, nor has the EU Commission been officially notified by the French authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have taken a range of actions to help the pig sector. With regard to export refunds, I have, along with my colleagues from other member states, secured substantial <Col N="1633" /> increases from the EU on four occasions since last May. In February of this year I followed this up by securing a further increase, when refunds for certain processed products for Russia were enhanced by 47 per cent to 80 per cent. These increases have been, and will continue to be, of help to the market.</P>
    <P>I was also successful in gaining agreement from the EU Commission for the introduction of a scheme of aids to private storage, under which EU funding is provided for the storage of pigmeat for a maximum period of six months. The scheme is still running and to date over 285,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been taken off the Community market temporarily. Ireland has 2,036 tonnes of pigmeat in storage under this scheme. This is a positive contribution towards improving the market.</P>
    <P>At the end of last year the Council of Ministers decided on a food-aid package for Russia, which includes 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. This package, when concluded, will have a positive effect on the market.</P>
    <P>Pigmeat prices have risen by 3 per cent since the beginning of the year and I am hopeful that this trend can be continued.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia launched an extensive promotional campaign for bacon earlier this year. This campaign was aimed at the consumer who was encouraged to buy quality assured bacon. This helped sales, thus improving the market.</P>
    <P>I will continue to press the Commission to utilise the instruments available under the common organisation of the market i.e. export refunds and aids to private storage, to the maximum extent possible. I have the support of a considerable number of member states in this approach.</P>

      <P>The western investment fund is being established under the Western Development Commission Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the western development commission, which was set up on a statutory basis on 1 February 1999 last, will administer the fund. An initial provision of £5 million for the fund is included in the vote for my Department in 1999.</P>
      <P>A requirement of the legislation is that the terms and conditions for state aid from the fund must be set by the commission with my agreement and that of the Minister for Finance. Pending the establishment of the new commission, and its taking a decision on how the fund would be utilised, it was not possible to finalise this any earlier. The matter is being pursued by the commission with my Department and I expect that it can be satisfactorily concluded soon.</P>
      <P>In addition, being financed by the Exchequer, it is necessary to obtain the clearance of the EU Commission for the operation of the fund as a State aid.

      <P>The products in question, which contain hormones, may be marketed in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU under a specific exception to the general EU hormone ban. The relevant EU legislation, however, attaches stringent conditions to their availability, resulting from which they are designated as prescription only by the Irish Medicines Board, which is the licensing authority in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Given that the national legislation governing, <i>inter alia,</i> how medicines are prescribed, has been in operation now for almost three years, my Department has been engaged in reviewing its operation generally, including in relation to this category of product. In doing so, full account is being taken of various views which have been expressed about the practical impact of the legislation and the need to ensure that efforts, aimed at improving the genetic quality of our national breeding herd, are not unduly hampered.</P>
      <P>It is hoped the review will be completed shortly. I should, however, emphasise that it is not intended to fundamentally alter the thrust of the legislation and that any adjustments must be consistent with the relevant EU legislation and with the maintenance of the highest possible standards of public and animal health protection.</P>

      <P>The person named will, therefore, retain her full quota for 1999 but she may not lease any part of it in 1999. She may use her quota herself in 2000 or she may commence a three year leasing cycle starting in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>The food industry development group, which was established under the aegis of my Department, has set out a proposed action plan for the future development of the industry. The group's report places emphasis on market orientation and competitiveness. While opportunities are foreseen in all market segments, the group considers that the added-value consumer foods and food ingredients sectors offer particularly strong growth prospects. The group stresses that future development must be underpinned by continuing attention to food safety and quality issues. <Col N="1639" /> On the particular issue of exports, An Bord Bia has developed a strategy to develop new market opportunities and this is reflected in the group's report.</P>
      <P>The report of the food industry development group is receiving consideration in the discussions on the new National Development Plan and the next round of structural funds.</P>

      <P>A key element in the market development strategy of An Bord Bia, is the broadening of the industry's market base by generating business that is new to Ireland and focusing resources in those areas likely to yield the greatest return.</P>
      <P>Its marketing strategy for the beef sector focuses on four core EU markets, namely the UK, France, Italy and Holland while continuing an active market development and promotional role throughout all EU markets. Its foodservice programme covering all product sectors is being extended to European markets, while similarly the private label programme is being extended to Germany and Spain.</P>
      <P>Following the re-opening of the Iranian beef market in 1998, a contract for the autumn is expected subject to normal commercial conditions. Irish beef was also exported to the Philippines for the first time in a number of years. An Bord Bia is increasing its focus in identifying new markets and expanding Irish food exports to Eastern European countries and selected CIS countries such as Azerbaijan. In addition, Turkey, Jordan and Tunisia are being targeted for development. The Irish food industry has achieved significant growth in the last five years with exports in 1998 exceeding £5 billion. Irish food is currently being exported to more than 100 countries, and An Bord Bia is committed to developing and extending its programmes and activities to maximise the potential of the industry.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to reduce the vehicle registration tax on wheelchair accessible taxis. The matter has been considered on a number of occasions but the cost <Col N="1640" /> to the Exchequer could be substantial. As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to Parliamentary Question No 113 dated 21 April 1999, I understand that Dublin Corporation intends to issue a total of 820 wheelchair accessible taxi licences between now and the year 2001. I have also been informed that the demand for the initial batch of licences, which were advertised in the press last month, far outstripped the number of 350 required. The application of VRT has not affected the demand for such licences.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation in the United Kingdom. Here at home, the Government is very much aware of the enormous contribution of family carers to looking after dependent, older people and other people with disabilities in the home. This concern was clearly illustrated in the 1999 budget. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has taken measures to improve assistance to carers through the carer's allowance. He has increased by £6 the care allowance for carers over 66 years and by £3 the allowance for carers under 66 years. There will also be a once-a-year payment of £200 towards the costs of respite care. On the health side, we have allocated a sum of £1 million as part of the budget allocation for older people to health boards, specifically for the support of carers. This fund can be used for the benefit of carers in a flexible manner, based on local needs. The improvement of liaison and support for individual carers and local voluntary groups who promote the interests of carers are examples of the type of support envisaged. The budget allocation will also enable more paramedical and nursing staff to be recruited and assigned to home care of older people which, in turn, will also assist carers. Some £800,000 has been earmarked for this purpose. I hope that we can build on these improvements in 2000 and subsequent years in the context of budgetary priorities.</P>

      <P>The provision of renal dialysis at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance. A new dialysis unit was opened there in March 1997, catering for 32 patients per week as part of the major capital development at the hospital. In 1998, I approved additional funding of £200,000 to enable the hospital to provide a service to further patients that required dialysis as demand for the service grew. As a result, a total of 42 patients are now attending the unit each week.</P>
      <P>I am aware that further demand for access to this service exists and my Department will continue to work with the South-Eastern Health Board in identifying and addressing the board's overall service development needs. In this regard, expansion of dialysis services will continue to be considered in the context of the board's competing priorities.</P>

As indicated in my reply of 21 April 1999, persons appointed registrars, who are not permanent and pensionable employees of the health boards, derive their incomes from fees for registrations and fees for the certificates issued by them. I refer the Deputy to S.I. No. 278 of 1987, which sets out the principal fees for the registration of events and the issue of certificates. In particular, and limited circumstances, a registrar may issue a certificate which is compiled from an entry in a register, in which amendments have been made, and the fees for such certificates are set out in S.I. 234 of 1987, which will be forwarded to the Deputy for his information.</P>

This year, a further £3 million, rising to £6 million on a full year cost basis in 2000, has been provided for this purpose. The determination of priorities for the expenditure of this funding, including personal assistance services, is a matter for the health boards in consultation with the co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services.</P>

In this regard, my Department commissioned an examination of the future organisation of the home help service in Ireland by the policy research centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People. This report has been published and is being considered by the health boards and my Department with a view to early implementation. Any difficulties that have arisen in the operation of the service will be examined as part of this process.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the report of the review group on the indicative drug target scheme, the Murphy report.</P>
      <P>The IDTS was introduced in 1993 to encourage rational and cost effective prescribing by general practitioners in the interests of improved patient care. Savings from the scheme are allocated to practice development projects and to investment in general practice projects. The review group, which was chaired by Professor Michael Murphy, Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, University College, Cork, was asked to provide an independent evaluation of the effect of the IDTS on the quality of patient care with particular reference to changing patterns of prescribing. The principal findings of the review group were that while there were changes in prescribing behaviour as a result of the IDTS, resulting in reduced drug costs, there were no discernible negative effects in overall quality of prescribing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has been made with regard to a number of recommendations made by the review group. The recommendation with regard to informing patients of the scheme has been taken into account in discussions on the scheme. Work is well advanced on the introduction of a unique patient identifier for general medical services patients and on the separation of pharmacists' fees from drug ingredient costs in determining indicative budgets. The group's recommendations with regard to the establishment of a national pharmacoepidemiology database and a linked <Col N="1647" /> prescribing morbidity database are being considered in the context of the development of IT systems for general practice/primary care. The Deputy will also wish to know that initiatives with regard to therapeutic guidelines for medical practitioners generally are also under consideration with a view to facilitating rational and quality prescribing.</P>
    <P>The recommendations made in the report will continue to inform the future development of the scheme.</P>

My Department is still awaiting the unions' decision to ballot on these proposals.</P>
      <P>With regard to the date of transfer, it was anticipated that the traffic wardens would report directly to Dublin Corporation on 29 April 1999. However, as the actual administrative arrangements have yet to be completed, the Garda Commissioner and my Department have agreed that the traffic wardens will report to their respective Garda stations on that date.

      <Quest>when his Department will stop the encroachment of the catchment area of St. Mary's College, Ballygar, County Galway, at Dysart and Creggs; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a substantial number of students are attracted away from the college as a result of this encroachment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will have investigations made into the case of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick who has been assessed for a reduced higher education grant due to the computation of VAT refunds calculated as reckonable income for grant purposes; his views on whether this is a justified computation in the assessment of a higher education grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I understand from Limerick County Council that the candidate to whom the Deputy refers was assessed for a higher education grant and qualified for a part maintenance grant (50 per <Col N="1655" /> cent) on the basis of the reckonable income calculated by the local authority. However, the reckonable income inadvertently included a VAT refund made to the candidate's father as a flat rate farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A flat rate farmer is a farmer who is not a taxable person for VAT purposes. Such a farmer, who has borne tax on the cost of the construction or improvement of farm buildings or on land rec<Col N="1656" /> lamation, may reclaim the tax in certain circumstances. The amount received as a VAT refund in such instances should not be included when calculating reckonable income for maintenance grant purposes.</P>
    <P>My Department has advised the local authority on the correct assessment of reckonable income in this case and the local authority will re-assess the candidates application and advise him of the outcome shortly.</P>
