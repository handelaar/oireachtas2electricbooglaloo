      <P>Is the Minister aware of reports of a high incidence of bogus voter registration in Castleblayney, County Monaghan? Will he ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to give assurances to the House that the matter will be investigated and that it is not a matter of policy that persons are falsely registered throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter, in the first instance, for the country registrar, but I will ask the Minister to look into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Government on its decision yesterday to refuse visas to the Yugoslav national team. It was a morally correct decision. On the possible consequences for the Irish team, will the Minister confirm that the matter will be raised at the Cologne summit and agree that there should be total solidarity that it would be unacceptable for Ireland to be punished for tak<Col N="2" /> ing a moral stand? On a related matter, what is the Government's attitude to the proposal to appoint the current Secretary General of NATO, Javier Solano, to the position of foreign and security policy chief in the European Union? What position will be taken by the Taoiseach when the appointment comes up for ratification?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal procedure is that the Taoiseach reports on the summit. Does the Minister wish to make a brief comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Deputies wish to comment on the first matter. I accept Deputy Howlin's point on the need for solidarity. Ireland has taken a stand. We were disappointed that UEFA did not accept its responsibility and take a clear decision which would have been helpful. Notwithstanding this, there is solidarity. The General Affairs Council ensured this in the first instance. The Taoiseach will raise the issue at the summit, <i>en marge</i> at least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the General Affairs Council and Sports Ministers have taken decisions on the matter, does the Minister agree it would be unacceptable for the Irish team to be penalised because the Government has taken a moral stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach made clear in the House and on radio yesterday that that is the Government's position. He also made clear that the Government had not been in contact with the FAI for some time and that the Government took the decision it believed was appropriate at the time once UEFA had made its position clear.</P>

Would it be possible for the Minister for Finance to come into the House when we resume on 16 June to make a statement on the possible adverse consequences of this decline and, in particular, the fact that we are fast approaching an exchange rate of 80p to £1 sterling?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in the sense that we import so much from Great Britain. We are increasingly importing more from Europe. The euro is settling in. Our exporters are currently very happy and there is no need for panic. We do not want to convey the impression that there is. I will convey the Deputy's remarks to the Minister for Finance who is keeping a watchful eye on the area and, if necessary, a debate can be held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>There are very strong views in this regard. Submissions have been made and it is important that people go back to the table and get on with the consultation process.

        <b>:</b> The Minister for the Environment and Local Government recently announced a new squad of civilian wardens to augment the Garda Síochána, particularly in relation to traffic regulation. In view of the fact the only people who have power to regulate traffic under legislation, including the Road Traffic Acts, are members of the Garda Síochána, is new legislation envisaged? Has any thought been given to redeploying some of the traffic wardens, many of whom are fearful about their future, if they are willing to be redeployed into the new service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister is standing in for the Taoiseach who is attending an EU summit in Cologne. Will the Minister indicate whether the Taoiseach will raise at that summit a matter of direct interest to his Department and to my constituency, that is, the proposal by the Commission to introduce a blue whiting quota of 14,000 tonnes? That would have disastrous consequences for the Irish fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishermen's organisation met with me yesterday and the Taoiseach joined us. He will raise the matter at the summit in Cologne. It is a crucial issue which is vital to Ireland's interests. The proposals are discriminatory against Ireland.</P>

Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform make a gesture to the licensing trade regarding the extension of hours for the forthcoming tourism season?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the welcome it has given to the Bill and for the useful and constructive observations made by Deputies during the debate. In these concluding remarks, I wish to address some of the points raised during the debate.</P>
      <P>The international dimensions of child protection are increasingly being acknowledged, whether they arise in the context of runaway teenagers or otherwise displaced children, the cross-frontier exploitation or abuse of children or the breakdown of international marriages. As the preamble to the convention indicates, the provisions of the convention were framed to take into account the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which was ratified by Ireland in September 1992. The UN convention is in essence a bill of rights for children and the Hague Convention of 1996 promises to be one important strand in the legal fabric required for the effective international protection of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Collins made reference to the Hague Convention on Child Abduction. The Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991, gives the force of law to two international conventions, namely, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the Luxembourg Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children. The conventions provide for the establishment of a central authority in each contracting state to facilitate their operation. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform operates as the central authority in Ireland. In the case of a child who has been abducted from the State to another country, the central authority is obliged, <i>inter alia,</i> to liaise with its foreign counterpart to locate the missing child. The foreign central authority will also arrange, if necessary, for court proceedings in its jurisdiction to secure the return of the child to Ireland. In the case of a child who has been brought into this country from another country, <Col N="9" /> the central authority will, <i>inter alia,</i> take or cause action to be taken to trace the child and will arrange, if necessary, for court proceedings to secure the return of the child.</P>
    <P>Since the Act came into force on 1 October 1991, the central authority has received a total of 570 cases involving 993 children. Of the 570 cases received, 286 involved children abducted into the State from another country and 284 involved children abducted from the State to another country.</P>
    <P>It would be a mistake to regard the role of the new convention as being primarily in cases of removal of a child against the wish of a parent &ndash; that is very far from being the case. Any advantages the new convention may have in such removal cases are incidental to its main function which is to prevent conflicts of jurisdiction relating to children from arising, to resolve doubts about the law applicable to parental responsibility, to provide for the recognition of measures in a whole host of non-controversial cases and to set up a framework for co-operation between contracting states.</P>
    <P>The 1996 Hague Convention will have a very different role from that of the Hague Convention on Child Abduction. The principle purpose of the Convention on Child Abduction is to protect children from the harmful effects of cross-border abduction, usually by a parent, by providing a procedure designed to bring about the prompt return of such children to the state of habitual residence. The role of the new Hague Convention is to prevent problems and conflicts from arising between the authorities in different jurisdictions, to ensure the effective allocation and use of resources and to maximise co-operation between jurisdictions. The two conventions should supplement each other very well.</P>
    <P>The new Convention on the Protection of Children will apply in some cases that involve the removal of children from one contracting state to another against the wish of a parent, which do not come within the scope of the Convention on Child Abduction. In the case of a child who is removed from the country of his or her habitual residence to another contracting state and has not yet acquired a habitual residence in the new state, the Convention on Child Abduction may not apply because, for example, the child is over the age of 16 years. Another example is where the non-abducting parent has not been exercising the rights of custody at the time of the removal although he or she objects strongly to the removal. In such circumstances it would be possible to use the new Convention on the Protection of Children. The parent in the state of the habitual residence might already have an enforceable order for custody or delivery of the child or might be able to obtain one quickly in the state of the habitual residence, which would clearly have jurisdiction under the new convention. The order could then be sent for recognition and enforcement under Chapter IV of the new Convention on the Protection of Children to the state where the child is living. Once declared enforceable <Col N="10" /> there, the order could be enforced in the second contracting state as if it had been made by the authorities of that state.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be possible to have cases of overlap between the Convention on Child Abduction and this convention. In such cases it is probable that the Convention on Child Abduction would be the favoured remedy because it is familiar and effective and is designed specifically to deal with cases of unlawful removal. The Convention on Child Abduction requires the central authority, for example, to initiate or facilitate an application to the courts on behalf of the foreign applicant to secure the return of a child who has been unlawfully removed and to provide or facilitate the provision of legal aid and advice in that regard. No such requirement is placed on the central authority under the 1996 convention and it will be up to the applicant to initiate proceedings and to apply for legal aid in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Shortall made reference to a children's Ombudsman. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, indicated to the House, in response to a parliamentary question on 22 April 1999, that it is his intention to proceed with the establishment of a children's Ombudsman and that options are currently being examined. No decision has yet been taken in regard to the powers to be assigned to the children's Ombudsman nor has a timescale been decided.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Shortall also made reference to the convention in the context of child abuse. Although the provisions of the 1996 convention are of general application in the context of the protection of children and are geared towards the avoidance of conflicts between courts and other authorities charged with the protection of children, its provisions are not without some strength in the context of the types of child abuse which have come to light in recent times. Chapter V in particular deals with co-operation between central authorities in contracting states and gives them a role in facilitating contact between courts and other authorities charged with the protection of children in their respective jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Article 31 of the convention obliges a central authority, on the request of a competent authority of another contracting state, to assist in discovering the whereabouts of a child where it appears that the child may be present and in need of protection within the territory of the requested state.</P>
    <P>Article 32 allows a central authority in one contracting state to request the central authority of the contracting state in which the child habitually resides to provide a report on the welfare of the child and to take measures to protect the child. This might arise, for example, in a case where a non-custodial parent, resident in Ireland, became aware that there was a risk to his or her child who is resident with the custodial parent in another contracting state. Supporting reasons would of course have to be given for such a request. In <Col N="11" /> addition, under Article 36 the competent authorities of a state, where measures of protection have been taken in respect of a child, have a duty to inform the competent authorities of a state, to which the child is removed as a result of a change of residence, of any serious danger to which the child is exposed, for example, an abusive parent.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the convention will complement the measures being taken by the Government in the area of child abuse as announced on 11 May 1999. A broad package of measures exemplifying the Government's pro-active stance in child abuse cases is the following: an apology on behalf of the State to victims of child abuse; the setting up of a Commission to Inquire into Childhood Abuse; expansion nation-wide of the counselling services available to assist victims of child abuse; the preparation of a White Paper on the mandatory reporting of child abuse; immediate amendment of the limitation laws as they relate to civil actions based on childhood sexual abuse; referral of the question of limitation in other forms of childhood abuse to the Law Reform Commission; and priority advancement of legislation to include a register of sex offenders.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, has already announced the membership of the Commission to Inquire into Childhood Abuse, which will consist of Ms Justice Laffoy of the High Court and two respected and experienced professionals from the field of child care and abuse therapy.</P>
    <P>Deputies Neville and Shortall made reference to the acquisition of guardianship rights by unmarried fathers. The term guardianship denotes a collection of rights and duties which a person enjoys in respect of a child. Section 6 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, provides that the married parents of a child are jointly the guardians of that child. In the case of unmarried parents, the mother is the guardian of the child. If the child's father subsequently marries the mother he automatically becomes a joint guardian; if not, he can apply to the court under section 6A of the Act, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, to become a joint guardian. The mother of the child cannot exercise a veto on such an application.</P>
    <P>The Children Act, 1997, which came into force in January 1998 makes it possible for a father who has not married the mother of the child to acquire joint guardianship rights with her without having to go to court provided both make a statutory declaration to the effect that they have not married each other; declare that they are the father and mother of the child concerned; agree to the appointment of the father as a guardian of the child; and have entered into arrangements regarding the custody of, and as the case may be, access to the child. Such a statutory declaration must be in the form prescribed in SI 5/98.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Review Group identified a number of issues under Article 41 of the Consti<Col N="12" /> tution, which concerns the family. Among the issues were an expanded constitutional guarantee for the rights of the child and the relative balance between parental and children's rights. The group, in its deliberations, considered the provisions regarding family and marriage in other constitutions and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    <P>The group pointed out that the focus of Article 41 of the Constitution is on the rights of the family as a unit as distinct from the rights of individual members of the family. The group considered that the focus of Article 41 emphasises the rights of the family as a unit to the possible detriment of individual members and considered that the best approach in any revised form of Article 41 would be to recognise the family as a primary or fundamental unit in society entitled to the special protection of the State or society but recognising also that the rights and duties which derive from marriage, family, parenthood or as a child are guaranteed to or imposed on the individuals.</P>
    <P>The group recommended the express inclusion of a number of rights of a child, including a right, as far as practicable, to be cared for by both parents and the desirability to put into the Constitution an express obligation to treat the best interests of the child as a paramount consideration in any actions relating to children.</P>
    <P>In making its recommendations regarding children the group took into account in particular the various provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Those provisions concern the child's right to be cared for by his or her parents and the desirability of continuity in a child's upbringing.</P>
    <P>The Report of the 1996 Constitution Review Group points out that any criticism of the fact that a natural father does not have a constitutionally protected personal right in relation to his child can readily be understood regarding natural fathers who live in a stable relationship with the natural mother or have established a relationship with the child. The report states that:</P>
    <P>there does not appear to be justification for giving constitutional rights to every natural father simply by reason of biological links . .</P>
    <P>It also states, were consideration to be given to any modification of Article 42.1 regarding the family to expressly include unmarried parents, that:</P>
    <P>care would have to be taken with the drafting to avoid giving rights to natural fathers who have no relationship with the natural mother or no relationship, other than a biological one, with the child.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution will, in due course, consider the deliberations of the Constitution Review Group.</P>
    <P>In so far as custody and access are concerned, the best arrangement for all concerned in custody/access cases is normally the one agreed by both parents without the need for court inter<Col N="13" /> vention. That is a matter of common sense. In the absence of agreement between parents, disputes relating to custody of and access to children are governed by the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>The reality is that courts are, and should be seen to be, a last resort in so far as the settlement of disputes regarding children are concerned. That is why the Children Act, 1997, encourages the use of counselling and of mediation.</P>
    <P>In the event of a case going to court, the court will make its decision on the basis of the evidence before it, including the evidence of both parents. What guides the court in making its decision under the 1964 Act are the circumstances of each case and what is best in the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>The 1964 Act empowers the court, having considered the evidence, to give such directions as it thinks proper regarding custody-access arrangements. In the absence of agreement between the parents, it is inevitable that the court will have to make hard and difficult decisions based on the evidence before it. If, on the basis of that evidence, sole custody is the best solution in terms of the welfare of the child, the court will make an order giving custody to one parent and access to another. Again, if the evidence is that joint custody is in the best interests of the child, the court will make an order for the parents to share custody.</P>
    <P>The Children Act, 1997, requires the court to have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis. This provision is inspired by a provision in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and is intended to direct the courts attention, in exercising its discretion, to the desirability of ensuring that children have ongoing and close contact with both their parents. It is wrong to assume that legislation favours one parent over the other in custody access disputes or that it prevents a court from making an order for joint custody, although there has been a perception that it does. In order to clarify matters the Children Act, 1997, states, for the avoidance of doubt, that a court may award custody of a child to a father and mother jointly.</P>
    <P>The courts should not, in my view, be compelled to award joint custody orders because to do so would be a departure from the principle that decisions in relation to guardianship, custody, access and upbringing must be made on the basis that the welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>I should also make mention of the fact that the Children Act, 1997, amended the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, to enable certain persons, including grandparents, to apply for an order granting access to a child on such terms and conditions as the court may order. That provision in the 1997 Act was intended to reflect the fact that continued contact with relatives such as grandparents can often be in the child's best interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> Deputies Higgins and Shortall referred to the delay in bringing forward the Bill. I am pleased to inform Deputies that only one State has ratified the convention to date, while two others have signed it. Consequently, the convention is not in force. On enactment of this legislation, Ireland will be one of the first countries to ratify the convention. It is extraordinary in that context that I, or the Government, should be accused of delay. I suppose the Opposition has to say something though that is not a very good way to proceed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall made reference to the ability of the courts to refuse to recognise an order where such order is deemed to be contrary to the best interests of the child. Article 23(2)(d) of the convention would allow the Irish courts to refuse to recognise an order if such recognition is manifestly contrary to the public policy of the State, taking into account the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall also referred to Legal Aid Board waiting lists. As Minister with responsibility for the Legal Aid Board, I am aware of the demands on its services. In consultation with the board, I continually monitor the position with regard to waiting times at the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board. I am aware that waiting times in some law centres are continuing to increase, notwithstanding the allocation of significant additional resources. Where waiting times, for whatever reasons, become excessive, the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioners scheme in the Dublin area on a pilot basis for some years. I understand that the board intends to extend the scheme on a nationwide basis in the coming months. The private practitioners scheme provides a complimentary legal service to that which is already available from the law centres. The nationwide expansion of the private practitioners scheme, should increase the throughput of legally aided cases and also enable the law centres to devote more resources towards non-District Court matters.</P>
    <P>The board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, to which Deputy Shortall specifically referred, child care and child abduction. A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis. For example, 1,879 of the 8,722 appointments offered in law centres in 1998 were for priority matters. None of those accorded priority were put on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In order to combat the increase in waiting times, I made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board in 1998 and again in 1999. I increased the grant-in-aid by 15 per cent in 1998 to £9.615 million and, in 1999, I am further increasing the allocation by 24 per cent to £11.953 million. In addition, I have allocated a further £1 million in 1999 for legal services for asylum seekers, bringing the total current allocation to £12.953 million, an increase of approximately 35 per cent over last year. Last July I approved 25 <Col N="15" /> additional posts for the Legal Aid Board. Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, were for law centres. In addition, I sanctioned the making permanent of six temporary staff, including three relief solicitors.</P>
    <P>Deputies Higgins and Shortall referred to juvenile justice legislation. Work on amending and expanding the Children Bill, 1996, which deals primarily with juvenile justice, is almost complete and all parts of the Bill have now been forwarded to the parliamentary draftsman's office where drafting is being given priority.</P>
    <P>Given the number of changes to the Bill it would be difficult, if not well nigh impossible, to process it through Committee Stage. Accordingly, the draftsman has been asked to proceed on the basis that a new Bill will be required and, as soon as the drafting has been complete, I intend to ask the Government for approval to publish the new Bill.</P>
    <P>In September 1998, the Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Fahey, visited New Zealand and, while there, took the opportunity to study its juvenile justice system, which has a reputation for being innovative and successful, at first-hand. He was particularly interested in the New Zealand system of family group conferencing, both for children who have committed offences and children who may be in need of care or protection. It is generally accepted that the New Zealand system cannot be transported to other countries but Deputy Fahey considered it worth undertaking a total examination of our system in the light of the New Zealand experience to identify the extent to which the ideas underpinning the New Zealand system might be adapted for use in Ireland. Accordingly, proposals for inclusion in the new Bill which I intend bringing to Government will reflect the outcome of that examination. The proposals will, in the main, be concentrated on the use of conferencing as a preventive measure, dealing primarily with children at risk and on expanding the existing family conferencing provisions in the current Bill to include a role for the court.</P>
    <P>There have also been major developments, not only in New Zealand but internationally, on the relatively new system of restorative justice and the Bill will seek to reflect that development also. My officials are currently preparing an extensive list of amendments to the Children Bill, 1996. It is hoped to have these amendments ready in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am very happy to recommend this Bill for Deputies' consideration. The Government is acutely aware of the changing face of family life, not alone in Ireland but internationally. There is increasing evidence of parental conflict relating to children and a consequential burden on the children and families involved. The international community has a stake in the outcome of cases involving children which goes beyond its ordinary interest in dispute resolution, extending to the <Col N="16" /> future well-being of citizens, with the attendant financial and human implications. Few clear winners emerge from courtroom battles relating to custody, access and other related matters &ndash; battles which are recognised as being among the most unpleasant, difficult and unrewarding aspects of the judicial function. These difficulties are exacerbated in international situations. This convention reflects the intention of those who participated in the Hague Conference to address some of these difficulties. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion the House debated human rights issues, we were marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That milestone gave us an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the principles of the declaration and to reaffirm that human rights are the birthright of all human beings. We acknowledged once again that the promotion and protection of these rights is the first responsibility of every government.</P>
      <P>Since then I have taken part in consultations and dialogues at bilateral and multilateral level on human rights issues in different parts of the world. It is clear that we need to do more to alleviate the suffering, address the wrongs and remove forever the cloak of impunity from the violators of human rights. We do not have to wait to be told where and when to act.</P>
      <P>On our own continent of Europe a human tragedy is unfolding which both shames us and presents us with a true test of our commitment to human rights. What is the point of having all of the international human rights instruments which have been signed and ratified by most countries of the world when every right enunciated in them is being grossly violated in Kosovo? This is a question every government of the free world has to ask itself at this time.</P>
      <P>Human rights are a declared policy priority of this Government. Have we matched our words with deeds in our response to the Kosovo crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I strongly support the efforts being made as we speak at political level to try to resolve the <Col N="17" /> crisis in the Balkans, I am very much aware of the nprecedented humanitarian challenges which face us and which will continue to face us over the coming months, regardless of the political outcome. I saw the squalid conditions in the camps during my visit to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia last week. Dispossessed men, women and children were doing their best to cope with dignity in hot, overcrowded tents with inadequate sanitation. Whatever the political outcome, the international community will have to continue to provide for the immediate needs of the thousands of people who have been denied the most basic of human rights and are living in the most difficult conditions in the countries bordering Kosovo, where up to 700,000 men, women and children are in camps or with host families.</P>
    <P>In addition to purely humanitarian concerns, it is imperative to demonstrate solidarity with states like the FYROM and Albania, which are bearing the brunt of the consequences of the refugee crisis in Kosovo. While our overriding priority has to be a political settlement, the needs of the refugees must be met for as long as is necessary. In this connection, I am seeking to have funds &ndash; 25 million euros &ndash; earmarked for the FYROM by the European Union, released by the European Commission as soon as possible. The FYROM is carrying a disproportionately heavy burden and it is in the interest of all of us who wish to see stability return to the region that we deliver assistance to that vulnerable country with the minimum delay.</P>
    <P>We have also to start planning now for the harsh Balkans winter where the temperature can sink as low as minus 20º Celsius. Winter accommodation must be planned for now for the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Albania and the FYROM.</P>
    <P>Although only limited access inside Kosovo has been allowed to the International Committee of the Red Cross and a United Nations assessment team, there is no doubt that conditions there are appalling. The High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her report on Kosovo, referred to the suffering of those who remain. Certain villages within Kosovo have become the refuge for large numbers of internally displaced people. Food is lacking, sanitation is poor and medical services almost non-existent. In its conclusions, the High Commissioner's report calls on the FRY authorities to end human rights violations and withdraw all army and paramilitary police units from Kosovo; calls on all concerned to intensify political negotiations; calls on NATO to respect the principles of international humanitarian law &ldquo;including the principle of proportionality&rdquo;; calls on the FRY authorities to facilitate the work of humanitarian agencies in assisting internally displaced persons in Kosovo; welcomes the indictment of Milosevic and four other Serb leaders as a &ldquo;major step&rdquo; in the process of tackling impunity, urges increased efforts in support of <Col N="18" /> refugees and internally displaced persons in the region and underlines the need for the refugee burden &ldquo;to be shared among more countries&rdquo;; and stresses the essential role of human rights work in any search for durable solutions.</P>
    <P>In the light of my experiences during my visit to the refugee camps in the FYROM, I fully endorse the High Commissioner's conclusions. We should also bear in mind, however, in a situation where only high profile cases are likely to come before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the role which human rights rapporteurs and treaty monitoring bodies can play in addressing violations. The Special Rapporteur for Executions has recently returned from the region and the Special Rapporteur for Violence Against Women is planning a visit shortly. Information collected through human rights de-briefings is being directed to relevant UN human rights mechanisms. The High Commissioner has also been careful to leave open the possibility that the Commission on Human Rights might convene a special session to consider events in Kosovo. This possibility was briefly discussed at a meeting yesterday in Geneva where our Permanent Representative to the UN, Anne Anderson, who would chair any special session, suggested that the matter be kept under review, bearing in mind the need for clarity on the possible outcomes of such a session.</P>
    <P>We have all been shocked and outraged at the suffering inflicted on the people of Kosovo by the governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia. The scale of indiscriminate force and callousness unleashed by their security forces and on their orders is a terrible mark on the end of this century, and an ominous warning that such actions have to be brought to an end if we are to face a better world in the new millennium.</P>
    <P>While such barbarity and cruelty is not confined to Europe, the fact that, in the case of Kosovo, it is occurring on our doorstep should, I hope, dispose of any sense of distance and complacency, not that we did not have earlier proof and warnings of the scale of inhumanity existing in our midst through the terrible example of Bosnia.</P>
    <P>We have been further dismayed to see, so far, the failure of the United Nations to forcefully and constructively address this problem. No less a person than the Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has criticised the &ldquo;hopelessly divided Security Council&rdquo; and the &ldquo;capricious&rdquo; way that members of the Council, including members with permanent seats, have used their votes and thereby failed to live up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>At the recent annual session of the UN Commission for Human Rights, the Secretary General spoke forcefully on this subject and clearly spelt out the primary concern which that organisation must have for humanitarian issues. He reminded the world that when people are suffering through war, and the cruelties and mass terror inflicted on civilian populations by military forces, they must <Col N="19" /> have a forum which will be responsive to their calls for defence and assistance.</P>
    <P>Human rights and humanitarian principles have been codified, but that is not enough. It is important that these codes be implemented, and the work to achieve this has to be carried out on different levels.</P>
    <P>The first and most important level is putting an end to the culture of impunity. Nobody, no matter how high his position, should feel he can carry out any act at will. Criminal justice provides a deterrent. That is why the International Criminal Court, of which the statute was adopted in Rome last year, is so important. However, that court will not be brought into existence until the statute has been ratified by the necessary number of states.</P>
    <P>The excesses carried out in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia were such that the United Nations established <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals to prosecute and punish those guilty of war crimes. The jurisdiction of the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia covers Kosovo. The European Union, in a declaration following the indictment of the FRY President Milosevic and other FRY leaders, pledged its continuing support for the work of the tribunal. It stated: </P>
    <P>We are all obliged to co-operate with the Tribunal. Our obligations to the Tribunal will remain unaltered by the outcome of the Kosovo crisis.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) Assessment Report on Sexual Violence in Kosovo documents the systematic use of rape and abduction as part of a strategy to degrade and expel a whole people from their land. We must use the evidence of this report, first, to develop a programme of comprehensive assistance for the victims of these unspeakable acts of violence, and, second, to ensure their ordeal is not forgotten or set aside and bring those violators to justice.</P>
    <P>The recent Council of Development Ministers of the EU affirmed the high priority accorded to the quick return of the refugees in safety and dignity. At the same time, we underlined the importance of substantial and effective responses to the humanitarian needs caused by the crisis. Substantial additional funding will be required. Ireland has already contributed £2.6 million in humanitarian assistance to the region, and the Government agreed this week to seek Oireachtas approval for additional funds of £6.39 million. A total of £6 million is being sought to allow us to continue to respond to this and other emergencies which may arise over the remainder of the year. The rest will be used to bolster the resources of the Refugee Agency, under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs, to help it implement Ireland's refugee evacuation programme. A technical team from Irish Aid will visit the region later this month to monitor the funding already disbursed and to develop proposals for future assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> The response of the Irish public, as distinct from the State, has been tremendous with Irish agencies receiving at least £6.8 million in voluntary contributions since the start of the crisis. This is a measure of the generosity of ordinary Irish people in the face of such a crisis.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provision of humanitarian assistance, a very important part of the Government's response to the tragic circumstances of the refugees is participation in the UNHCR's emergency evacuation programme. We made an initial commitment to receive 1,000 refugees and upwards of 700 will have arrived by later today &ndash; a flight will arrive in Farranfore this evening. Two more flights over the next fortnight will bring the figure to around 1,000. The refugees are being accommodated in various locations around the country, including the decommissioned Army barracks in Kildare and a number of privately owned centres in the south. Overall the welcome given to the refugees has been outstanding and offers of support and hospitality continue to be received from local communities.</P>
    <P>There has been an unprecedented and unique team effort on the part of Departments, local authorities and health boards. Public services, local authorities and individuals have rallied around to ensure that refugees who arrive in this country are given a very warm, genuine welcome and are provided with the care and services they need. I have been hugely and genuinely impressed by the efforts made by all involved in the evacuation programme &ndash; from our teams on the ground in the FYROM to those involved in providing accommodation and care for the refugees around the country.</P>
    <P>In the short time since they arrived, refugees have already begun to take an active part in their local communities. Some have taken up employment, mothers with children have joined mother and toddler groups and some children have started swimming lessons and have been introduced to GAA games. Language classes are commencing for adults with a separate summer programme for children who will attend local primary schools in the autumn. We can be proud of our response in this humanitarian emergency so far and we will continue to provide the necessary resources to ensure the highest standard of care and assistance for refugees in this country.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR has filled 73,000 of the 135,000 places offered by a large number of countries and expects to evacuate a further 40,000 over the next few weeks. We are in constant contact with the UNHCR which is reviewing the humanitarian evacuation programme in light of arrivals and conditions in the camps, particularly those in Albania and Macedonia. Ireland will be ready to respond immediately to a further request to take additional refugees and plans are being put in place to that end in terms of accommodation.</P>
    <P>East Timor is another area which has seen appalling violations of human rights but there is some reason for guarded optimism. During the visit of the Portuguese President, we made clear <Col N="21" /> our support for and gratitude to Portugal for what has been achieved as a result of the agreement with Indonesia signed in New York on 5 May. We have always been sympathetic to the plight of the people of East Timor and recognise that the latest positive developments would not have been possible without the principled stand taken by Portugal over many years. We hope that the people of East Timor will soon be able to freely exercise their right to self-determination.</P>
    <P>However, the level of violence in the territory perpetrated by armed militias remains alarmingly high. During his visit to Dili in April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, experienced at first hand the brutality of the armed militias against the local population and the indifference of the Indonesian authorities to the violence taking place around them. Upon returning to Jakarta, he immediately contacted the Indonesian Foreign and Defence Ministers to register his deep concern and to demand action to bring an end to the violence. Before he left Jakarta, the Minister also conveyed his views by telephone to the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and to the Portuguese Foreign Minister, Mr. Gama. There is little doubt that the Minister's visit and actions helped to bring the issue to a negotiated settlement.</P>
    <P>We must now address the task of reconciliation between the people of East Timor. This has to be a priority if lasting peace is to be achieved. Everything possible must be done to avoid the risk of further death and destruction, even if that might lead to some delays in the current plan for the consultation process. The EU and its member states must do all they can to assist the people of East Timor at this critical time. We are fully supportive of the proposed EU joint action and other proposals for providing substantial humanitarian and other assistance to the Timorese people and believe that the EU Commission's current proposals for aid to East Timor should be expanded.</P>
    <P>Ireland hopes to be in a position to offer police officers as well as financial assistance to the UN trust fund which will oversee the consultation process scheduled to take place on 8 August. A contribution of £50,000 has already been made to the human rights and democratisation fund which is part of the Irish aid budget.</P>
    <P>Other areas of the world provide ongoing cause for concern and, all too rarely, some grounds for satisfaction. The Middle East region has all these ingredients. The lack of transparency and openness in the conduct of Algerian affairs remains a grave concern to the international human rights community. The elections in April of this year, which were to be fair and democratic, turned out to be a serious disappointment. I was quite disheartened by the fact that six opposition candidates felt compelled to withdraw from the campaign before election day. Without the approval of the Algerian Government there was no possibility of sending international observers to ensure that the elections were fair and above suspicion. <Col N="22" /> This lack of transparency is further evidenced by the Algerian Government's failure to allow visits by UN special rapporteurs on extra-judicial killings and torture. Numerous observers, including the committee on human rights, have expressed revulsion at the widespread massacre of men, women and children in a great number of villages and towns.</P>
    <P>As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Algeria is required to ensure that independent mechanisms are set up to investigate all violations of the right to life and the security of the person, that offenders be brought to justice and that access be given to independent observers. Without full respect for human rights by all sides, there is little hope of bringing stability to Algeria and of resolving this bloody dispute which has claimed the lives of more than 65,000 people since violence erupted in early 1992.</P>
    <P>It is also true that, while efforts are being made to mediate between both sides in the Middle East peace process, there is evidence of a failure by the Israelis and the Palestinians to observe strict human rights standards. It is worth noting that the human rights committee last year noted the democratic nature of Israeli society but, at the same time, regretted that the fourth Geneva convention had not been incorporated into Israeli law. The committee pointed to the Israeli failure to apply the covenant in the occupied territories and expressed serious concern over what it called &ldquo;deeply imbedded discriminatory social attitudes, practices and laws against Arab Israelis&rdquo;. The committee added that it was concerned by the number of Palestinians killed by the security forces in the occupied territories and about the draft law which denies Palestinians compensation for excesses committed by members of the Israeli security forces.</P>
    <P>The committee also expressed concern about the policy of confiscating lands from Palestinians and about the guidelines for the conduct of the interrogation of suspected terrorists which allow the use of &ldquo;moderate physical pressure&rdquo;. I hope that the election of Labour leader, Ehud Barak, once he has formed a government, will bring about an improvement in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Palestinian Authority has been accused of detention without charge of suspects against whom it has found insufficient evidence. At the end of August, two policemen were executed just 24 hours after a guilty verdict had been announced in their trial for murder. Earlier this year, the EU expressed concern about such arbitrary political arrests and noted that Amnesty International had documented human rights violations committed by numerous Palestinian security services in the areas under the Palestinian Authority's jurisdiction. These violations ranged from the use of torture and unlawful killings to the failure to adequately investigate violations and the arrest of journalists and human rights defenders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> A country in which much welcome progress is being achieved is the Islamic Republic of Iran. The reforms which President Khatami has expressed a desire to implement, including the cultivation of a tolerant, diverse and law abiding society, are very welcome and were acknowledged in March by the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Perhaps the development which best signifies this new era in Iran was the lifting in September last year of the <i>fatwa</i> against the writer Salman Rushdie.</P>
    <P>There is still cause for concern regarding the treatment of the Baha'i in Iran. Ireland is fundamentally opposed to capital punishment. However, in common with our EU partners and with human rights organisations, Ireland would wish to ensure that in Iran, as in other countries where capital punishment remains on the statutes, such a sentence would only be imposed on conviction for very serious crimes. We would be concerned where, in disregard of the provisions of the international covenant on civil and political rights and the UN safeguards, executions are carried out in cases involving apostasy.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the reformist aspirations of President Khatami since his election ought to be recognised. In particular, I welcome his statements about the need to review laws and attitudes which discriminate against women. The participation of women in elections this year in Iran, including the election of President Khatami's sister, indicates that this is being put into practice.</P>
    <P>In this brief review of human rights issues, we should also look closer to home. It is now a little over a year since the people of Ireland, North and South, gave their overwhelming support to the Good Friday Agreement and the way forward in partnership that it represents. As we approach the 30 June deadline which was set by Prime Minister Blair for the achievement of devolution, there has inevitably been considerable focus on the areas of the agreement where progress has not been as we would have wished it to be &ndash; on the institutions and the fact that they have yet to come into being. While such a lack of progress is both disappointing and deeply frustrating for all concerned, it is important that it should not cause us to overlook the work that has been successfully progressing in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement is based on the principles of partnership, equality and mutual respect. It states that the governance of Northern Ireland:</P>
    <P>shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality on behalf of all of the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions and shall be founded on the principles of full respect for, and equality of, civil, political, social and cultural rights, of freedom from discrimination for all citizens and of parity of esteem and of just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> The human rights and equality agenda, so central to the agreement, is essentially about fairness and inclusivity. The creation of a society with these principles at its core is part of the great challenge with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that unfairness and inequality fuelled unrest in Northern Ireland. Violations of human, civil and political rights in the North led to the establishment of the civil rights movement over 30 years ago and caused deep alienation of the Nationalist community in particular. Catholics were faced with real and structured discrimination on a large scale in areas such as housing, employment and voting rights. Equally, there can be no doubt that the totally inadequate response of the then Government of Northern Ireland to legitimate demands for justice and equality at that time had a profoundly destabilising effect on Northern Ireland society.</P>
    <P>It alienated many young people, fuelling an anger which all too easily spilled over into violence. The long dark years of conflict were a serious detriment and obstacle to the cause of rights and equality. The decades of violence which the people of the North had to endure saw the equality issue neglected and pushed to one side, postponing the vital action which was urgently needed to deal with deep political grievances.</P>
    <P>The peace process provided a space for a new focus to be brought to bear on rights and equality issues. They constituted a central element in the negotiations which led to agreement on Good Friday, 1998. All participants recognised that any agreement to be workable would have to deal seriously with the equality agenda. The agreement, containing an entire chapter devoted to rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, represents a powerful statement by the two Governments and the parties about their serious desire to address these issues in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>The task of implementing the agreement involves not only the creation of the political institutions that it provides for but also the building of the society which it envisages. It is my argument that, particularly on the human rights front, we have taken real and significant steps in that direction in the past year. In the North, a Human Rights Commission is up and running and stands ready to make a significant contribution to bringing about the new beginning which the agreement promised to the people of this island. Part of its vital work will include drawing up a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the appointment of Professor Brice Dickson as chief commissioner in March of this year. He and his fellow commissioners are going about their work in an imaginative and creative way. A man of considerable reputation and ability, he has voiced his desire, which I share, to make the commission a people's commission relevant to the concerns of every person. The commission is at present engaged in a public consultation exercise to ensure that this is the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> In drawing up the specifications for our own human rights commission &ndash; work is well advanced on the legislation to bring it into being &ndash; we must approach our task with the same level of commitment and creativity. While we have an obligation under the agreement to ensure that our commission has a mandate and remit equivalent to that of the Northern Ireland commission, this should be a minimum requirement, not a target we set ourselves. We can and should go further.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach suggested, in empowering our commission we should endeavour to establish a body that will be a model of its kind in Europe, an example that people in other countries would look to when establishing their institutions. In taking the guidelines laid down by the United Nations, the Paris Principles, as our point of departure, we should set, not follow, standards for international best practice in the field. Furthermore, our commission should draw together people from all backgrounds who have demonstrated a firm commitment to human rights and who have a real contribution to make to a just society. It should be inclusive and reflect the make up of our community in all its diversity. It goes without saying that in establishing the commission we should ensure that it is equipped with the tools it requires to carry out its task efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made towards implementing other rights and equality aspects of the agreement. On 7 May, in keeping with our obligations under the agreement, Ireland ratified the Council of Europe framework convention on national minorities coinciding with the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Council. An interdepartmental working group is following up the Government's commitment under the agreement to further strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights. These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international instruments in the field of human rights. The question of the incorporation of the ECHP is being further examined in this context.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has set September next as the target date for implementation of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and infrastructure to underpin the legislation &ndash; the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations &ndash; is being put in place. The Equal Status Bill is also making legislative progress. In the North, work is proceeding towards the establishment of a new equality commission. I look forward to it working to combat discrimination across a range of categories, including gender, race and sexual orientation as well as combating religious discrimination.</P>
    <P>The agreement was about creating a new beginning, one which has at its core a dynamic rights and equality culture. For the Nationalist community in particular, demonstrable progress on these issues will be as vital a sign as progress <Col N="26" /> on the institutional aspects that a future built on justice and equality is being achieved. However, the issues of human rights and equality are important for everybody in Northern Ireland &ndash; Unionist and Nationalist, Catholic, Protestant and dissenter. They are not just part of a Nationalist agenda. That was always clear throughout the negotiations. We are all stakeholders in this part of the agreement. While much remains to be done to achieve this, I am pleased with the progress to date and I am both personally and professionally committed to ensuring that we continue to build actively and urgently on it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, any review of human rights issues will have to conclude that people continue to suffer appalling abuses almost everywhere. We cannot act to put right what we have neglected to do in the past. What we can do is ensure that we are not found wanting when we have the opportunity to act for the good of our fellow human beings. Human rights vigilance is not just a matter of international affairs. It must include protection of the individual human rights of our own citizens, including our prisoners, travellers and refugees. I welcome much of the progress made on that front over the past few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased, as my party's spokesperson on foreign affairs and as chairman of the Oireachtas sub-committee on human rights, to have an opportunity to participate in this debate. Without wishing to be negative about the Minister of State's wide-ranging speech, it appears to have been a Dublin 4 type stroll through many issues. Not only is it a Dublin 4 type stroll which would be supported by the Progressive Democrats, it would be supported by Members of all parties in the House. We have become a soft option led group of people who are not prepared to look at some of the more difficult human rights issues on our doorstep. When we think of human rights, we think of what is happening in China, Sri Lanka and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was more forcefully struck by this when I looked at the programme of the sub-committee on human rights of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am chairman. We can only examine foreign affairs issues, although we will examine the prisons in the context of a report on prisons. The work programme for 1999 includes the need to monitor and promote respect for, and the advancement of, human rights having regard to the priority areas identified in the White Paper on foreign policy and with specific reference to the following: the rights of women, children, persons with disabilities and minorities, rights in the context of peacekeeping mandates, corporations and human rights, drugs and human rights, freedom of expression and academic freedom, the right to non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, the international criminal court, racism, the death penalty, the right to religious belief and practice, situations causing departure from their home countries of refugees <Col N="27" /> and the rights of prisoners. The sub-committee has said that it will seek as appropriate to meet the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, and a meeting is scheduled soon, and our permanent representative at the Irish mission in Geneva, Ambassador Anne Anderson, who is doing very good work in this area.</P>
    <P>The multilateral issues the sub-committee has identified and will examine include the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, the Council of Europe, the European Union and the role of the OSCE. The sub-committee will deepen its understanding of human rights by contact with non-governmental agencies, Irish and international, political and other representatives with expertise in human rights &ndash; for example, ambassadors and visiting parliamentarians, academics and other experts &ndash; and representatives of the human rights commission in Northern Ireland when it is established.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee will also meet with NGOs involved with the standing committee in the Department of Foreign Affairs. We will meet with the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign, Amnesty International, Banúlacht, Christian Aid Ireland, Concern, Dóchas, GOAL, Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Irish national committee for UNICEF, Oxfam Ireland, Trócaire, Kurdistan Ireland Solidarity, Action Aid, LASC, Irish Mexico Group, the Ogoni Solidarity Group, Burma Action Group, Sierra Leone-Liberia Group, Human Rights Watch, Association of Nigerian Asylum Seekers in Ireland, <i>Observatoire Internationale de Prisons</i> and NGOs opposed to the death penalty in the United States. The areas on which we have concentrated include Kosovo, the Great Lakes region of Africa, Burma, East Timor, Sudan, Nigeria, Algeria, Kurdish regions and China. We have also examined the Kurdish question and human rights in Turkey.</P>
    <P>Most of those issues are the usual suspects. It is nonetheless a welcome development that, following the White Paper, a standing committee on human rights exists in the Department of Foreign Affairs and that the Minister of State has responsibility for that issue. We now have an Oireachtas sub-committee on human rights and there will also be human rights commissions, North and South, with an over-arching body. With Mrs. Mary Robinson as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the work of Ambassador Anderson, we are at last taking our role in the area of international human rights more seriously. However, I do not agree with everything Mrs. Robinson has said in her role as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</P>
    <P>In taking our role seriously, it is time we had more debate and stopped pandering to what we see as the fears and prejudices of the country. For us to take and give leadership based on fear and prejudice is no more than what has been done in <Col N="28" /> Northern Ireland for 50 years. When we sometimes speak of the irredentist attitudes of some Unionists in Northern Ireland, we forget we have some deep seated irredentist positions in the Republic and I wish to refer to some of those as part of my contribution.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State can tell us the up to date position on a number of matters about which the sub-committee heard from the Department of Foreign Affairs human rights unit in January last relating to progress towards ratification of international human rights instruments Ireland has signed. These specifically relate to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, 1965; Protocol Additional to the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I)(1977); Protocol Additional to the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)(1977); the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1984; Protocol No. 7 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1984; the European Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, 1995; the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights, 1996 and the European Agreement on Persons participating in the proceedings of the European Court of Human Rights, 1996. Will the Minister of State give the House an update on where progress has been made in implementing these conventions and what steps have been taken to ensure some of these, which are many years old, are legislated for?</P>
    <P>Given Ireland's new economic power, we must learn to use that to the betterment of human life at home and abroad. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: &ldquo;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights&rdquo;. In giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs some months ago, the director of Amnesty International quoted a notice which she saw pinned to a secondary school notice board. It read:</P>
    <P>I am a survivor of a concentration camp. My eyes saw what no man should witness: gas chambers built by learned engineers. Children poisoned by educated physicians. Infants killed by trained nurses. Women and babies shot and burned by high school and college graduates. So I am suspicious of education. My request is: Help your students become human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths, educated Eichmanns. Reading, writing, arithmetic are important only if they serve to make our children more human.</P>
    <P>I do not take the occasion often to put on record my view on the right to life. The record of the House will show I abstained on the pro-life amendment which came before the House and I voted against it as a private citizen. I wish to <Col N="29" /> make it clear that I am a pro-life Deputy and person and I expect my views on that to be respected, just as others with different views expect their views to be respected. I do not want to open a can of worms and I do not want to become identified as a loose cannon. Some of those who try to bludgeon this issue do it more damage and make it very difficult for anyone to speak rationally about it. They should have taken a deep breath and counted to ten before saying some of the things they said. However, many Members who are pro-life are being taken for granted in a politically correct world which has gone mad. I believe in the live and let live philosophy and do not seek to hold myself out as more righteous than anyone else.</P>
    <P>There are two views on the question of the right to life. One is that it begins with conception, the other that it is the woman's right to choose. I am not associated with any organisation which has sought to campaign on these issues. I do not support anything which puts the life of the mother in danger. However, I believe that human life begins at conception. It is time we considered this issue in the context of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the message to which the director of Amnesty International referred which was pinned to a secondary school notice board.</P>
    <P>There are those who interpret human rights as they relate to this issue in a much different way than I would and that is one of the areas in respect of which I disagree with Mrs. Robinson. The reason I say this is that I do not want her reported views to be taken as the only views on this subject. A strong case can be made for the protection of life as a human right and I would like this issue to be debated rationally in that context, without putting anyone in danger or without people trying to force their views down the throats of others.</P>
    <P>Dr. Barney Patanya, chairperson of the South African Human Rights Commission, in a keynote address delivered last year at a conference entitled &ldquo;Human Rights and the Millennium&rdquo;, which was launched by the Minister of State, emphasised that poverty is a gross abuse of human rights and a source of violence in many parts of the world. It is, he stated, &ldquo;a shocking paradox that in a global economy of $26 trillion, 1.3 billion people live on less than a dollar a day&rdquo;. He also noted that &ldquo;Tackling the root causes of poverty lies at the core of achieving a just and peaceful world&rdquo;, and further stated that &ldquo;Poverty, therefore, is the denial of the right to make choices about the most basic needs of humanity like living a healthy life, enjoying a decent standard of living and living one's life in freedom with dignity and respect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a unique and acute experience of violence and we must not believe that the Northern Ireland peace process alone will bring peace for all time to all parts of this island. If we want peace for the entire island, it must be peace with justice. Where is the justice of fair and equitable <Col N="30" /> access to third level education? Where is the justice in our housing policies? Dublin Corporation will build approximately 230 houses this year but we were able to build more than 1,700 houses in poorer times. The vast housing estates in Blanchardstown, Tallaght and Clondalkin were built when we had only half the wealth we have today. Is it any wonder that there is a housing crisis and growing homelessness? Surely access to decent housing is a basic human right.</P>
    <P>It strikes me as quite extraordinary that in Opposition politicians become seized with issues of social justice but that in Government they become paralysed. Sometimes there is a simple reason for this. Politicians entering Government bring with them an agenda but they also take on the agenda of the permanent Government. The latter agenda includes many constant and pressing issues which take up a great deal of Ministers' time and attention. It would be a major contribution to human rights and to tackling social injustice here if the main parties in Opposition agreed a platform to tackle the human rights abuse of poverty which they would implement intact, if elected to Government. If not elected, we might, at the very least, set the agenda for the party in power.</P>
    <P>The contribution to peace and justice being made by the Northern Ireland peace process is welcome. It is not an end in itself, it represents the opportunity to bring about a new Ireland where human rights, in its broadest sense, is a central concern. In Northern Ireland and here in the Republic, human rights commissions are to be established with an over-arching arrangement. The sub-committee on human rights, of which I am chairperson, had the opportunity to meet one of Mrs. Robinson's senior officials who has great experience in this area and I see great hope for the future as a result of the establishment of these bodies.</P>
    <P>As part of the terms of reference of the bodies to which I refer, the Minister should give consideration to bringing about programmes in democracy training for former paramilitaries. There are many people in my constituency, some of whom I am sure are well intentioned, who have spent their lives using the balaclava, the gun and the boiler suit. They know no other way to operate than by putting a gun in the mouth of a nine year old boy and threatening him. They do so regardless of the fact that they may have mistaken the boy for another with the same name who they originally meant to threaten.</P>
    <P>The individuals to whom I refer have spent their lives intimidating people, making demands of them and acting as judge, jury and executioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct in many cases. These people are now, I hope, on the democratic road and some of them are finding it difficult to understand that participation in democracy <Col N="31" /> means just that. In a democracy everyone takes his chance when he goes before the electorate. If he obtains a mandate he must exercise it with reasonable care, decency and diligence and cannot resort to forcing his view on others. I do not say this lightly or flippantly because there are a number of people running in the current local election campaign in Dublin city, county and elsewhere would could do with being trained in the tenets of democracy. If that happened it would contribute to human rights because it would remove the sub-culture of violence with which and into which this small minority of people have grown.</P>
      <P>I will now to refer to another soft option we have taken in respect of human rights and security. Ireland has not always been the most efficient in terms of ratifying human rights undertakings, even those we have given to the United Nations. I refer particularly to the UN Convention on the Protection of United Nations and Related Personnel Serving Abroad. I introduced a Private Members' Bill on this issue and for two years I have been seeking ratification of that convention which is designed to bring before the courts of those states who pass it into law, those who attack UN personnel serving abroad or their property.</P>
      <P>A majority of the countries which signed this convention &ndash; I believe there are 23 of them &ndash; have ratified it and it is international law within their jurisdictions. If the people responsible for killing an Irish soldier in Lebanon earlier this week were passengers on an aeroplane which landed in Auckland, they could be removed from it and charged under New Zealand law. However, if the plane landed in Dublin they could not be charged. Given that we have the single largest battalion serving for the longest period in Lebanon and following the death of one of our soldiers there, we cannot be proud that we have not given serious consideration to ratifying the convention either by way of Government legislation or acceptance of the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.</P>
      <P>Irish soldiers, gardaí and civilians serving abroad under the UN mandate are entitled to the protection of Irish law. Furthermore, when we pass the convention into law we should put pressure on other states to do so in order that those who attack people serving under the UN mandate will not be able to gain refuge anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leads me to an important matter which must be faced by organisations such as NGOs. In the past, and to a lesser extent recently given the debate on the Partnership for Peace, Ireland has opted out of being one of the architects in changing European security structures. An important meeting is taking place today in Cologne and our reaction to it will be &ldquo;God help us, because we are caught between a rock and a hard place&rdquo;. We will keep our heads down and hope that we will come out of the meeting with a formula that will allow us to explain to the people why we are not going to abandon our neutrality. When will we <Col N="32" /> develop ideas and suggestions in respect of European security architecture?</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa has already put forward an interesting suggestion in this area which is worthy of debate and discussion. The more ideas of this nature which are put forward the better. We need to be one of the architects. Why leave it to others to make the rules and then try to sneak in and adapt to those rules or stay out altogether? It is clear, particularly after the Kosovo and other Balkan crises, there will be an evolution in the European security and defence architecture and that those who are in from the beginning, as with EMU, will make the rules. Unless we can help to make the rules, we will be forced to stay out completely or to join.</P>
    <P>If the aspirations contained in the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties about the eventual possible merger of an integral part of the Western European Union and the EU gain currency and a merger takes place, the single biggest problem for us will be the article 5 commitment of the Western European Union treaty, which is a mutual defence commitment that if one member state is attacked we must automatically go to its defence. One of the questions fleshed out at the reflection group which prepared the Amsterdam Treaty agenda &ndash; I helped to flesh it out &ndash; was what would happen to article 5 if an eventual merger took place.</P>
    <P>If there was a merger, it would be in our interest to negotiate article 5 as a protocol to any future treaty so that we would have the right to opt in and out as we choose. That would leave us the maximum flexibility if a European defence entity was established. Even if we did not join from the beginning, we should try to have treaty drafted in such a way that the article 5 commitment becomes a protocol and that those who want to opt in can do so, but that we have options for the future which we do not now have. We need to take a more active role in the evolving defence and security structure in Europe. We should be one of the architects and we should make our contribution accordingly.</P>
    <P>The view that NATO is a dirty word and that any association with it, however meek, is not worthy of discussion is not a security policy. If human rights and humanitarian aid are to be delivered, there will be times when peace-making, as distinct from peace-keeping, will be a necessity. Our policy cannot be that we will fight to the last Dutch, Belgian or US soldier. NATO took on the tyrants in Bosnia and Kosovo, although not with great success there so far.</P>
    <P>I sat at many EU ministerial meetings as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs where we discussed declarations and <i>démarches</i> while people were slaughtered in their millions on our doorstep. Those who talk about human rights in high moral tones must also ensure we take our share of responsibility for ensuring that human rights issues are enforced where it is necessary. We should, at least, join Partnership for Peace <Col N="33" /> without any further delay. If tyrants are to be brought to heel, there must be ethical security structures capable of participating in such a process.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a role to play in these security arrangements. We should remember that our participation in security arrangements in whatever way we choose after due discussion and debate, not after pandering to people's fears, is a matter of social justice. Sometimes people in this House say that those who are pro law and order are right-wingers. Some right-wingers are pro law and order, but the majority of us in this House are pro law and order because the people who suffer when there is no law and order are the weakest members of our community. It is usually women who are raped and children who cannot be sent to the corner shop for messages because they must run the gauntlet of thugs. The people who live in the poorest communities suffer most from drug pushers.</P>
    <P>Law and order is a matter of social justice. If there is no law and order, the rule of the jungle will apply where the strongest, the wealthiest and those who are best equipped will bully the rest. Security is also a matter of social justice. If we do not have ethical, organised and participative security arrangements in Ireland and on the Continent, tyrants, such as Milosevic, will have their way. People who denounce those of us who dare to put forward this view need to be challenged because it is a matter of social justice.</P>
    <P>I hope &ndash; I am not deterred in my hopes as I still hope the Olympics will eventually come to Dublin &ndash; that those of us in Opposition will come together with a strong social justice programme which we will implement in Government or, if we do not get into Government, which will set the Government's agenda. I want part of that agenda to be prison reform. There are no votes in prison reform, but are we only here to look for votes? I do not know how long more I or anyone else will be in this House, although I am not looking too shaky at present. However, will we look back on our time here and say we spent it asking questions and responding to individual constituents but we did not progress the things we went into politics in the first place to progress, such as prison reform?</P>
    <P>About 75 per cent of the prisoners in the overcrowded main prison in this city, Mountjoy jail, come from five identifiable areas in the city. That covers the three constituencies represented by myself, Deputy De Rossa and the Taoiseach. Most of these people come from areas where access to education is not on the agenda. That was the reality when I was growing up. My father died when I was five years of age. As one of nine young children, I was to go to work in the local factory, but I had other ideas. I went to school at night and, recently, I got the opportunity to go to Queen's University for which I am grateful.</P>
    <P>Many people are able to do different things but the options are not available to them. Their lives are set out for them and they do not include the <Col N="34" /> option of third level education or a trade. Is it any wonder that when we put such a millstone of hopelessness around communities a disproportionate number of them turn to crime? If we are serious about social justice we must provide access to education and decent housing, not the type of housing we have tolerated in St. Michael's Estate, Fatima Mansions and Bridgefoot Street, and we must have prison reform. If we cannot do it now when the coffers are full, when will we do it?</P>
    <P>It is time we left aside the cute-hoorism that says there is only one place to be and that is in Government. That is not necessarily true. We can set the agenda from the Opposition benches without trying to outsmart or get an advantage over each other, but by trying to initiate prison reform, although there are no votes in it, and providing access to education. One way of doing that would be, for example, to ensure that educational services are delivered on a partnership area basis, whereby the source of the problem and the person delivering the service can be identified so that those who are not delivering can be held accountable to a specific person, rather than to a bureaucrat in Marlborough Street. We could usefully turn our minds to this as it is a human rights issue. I make no apology for anybody in prison because anybody who is in one deserves to be there if they attacked somebody else; this is not an apologia for prisoners. However, more of the same people will be sent to prison if something is not done about prison reform. People enter prison without a drugs problem and leave with one. That is the type of administration being run, not by the Turkish Government in Ankara but by the Irish Government in Dublin. Perhaps a little less attention should be given to accentuating differences between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party, and Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Perhaps, all of us should examine our consciences, outline a number of issues such as this and make progress on them.</P>
    <P>A report published last year by Trócaire referred to the human rights impact of global institutions, such as the World Bank and the IMF. It stated that their impact, particularly on poverty, should be measured and their policies assessed and reformed. It is clear that many countries are sinking under the weight of international debt and are not capable of meeting the repayment requirements that have been placed on them, but debt cannot be forgiven in all countries.</P>
    <P>However, it would help if regional organisations, such as the European Union, were to seek the creation of a debt commission to review international debt with a view to forgiving debt in countries where the burden of repayment is at such an unacceptable level as to be an infringement of basic human rights. Such a commission could make recommendations for mitigating debt based on stated considerations, including human rights.</P>
    <P>The UN has set 0.7 per cent of GNP as the agreed target which states should meet as their <Col N="35" /> contribution to development aid. Ireland, at a time of unprecedented wealth, is finding it difficult to keep its promise to reach 0.45 per cent of GNP as an interim step and in recent years its contribution as a percentage of GNP slipped back. Ireland never meets its UN commitment, despite the Minister of Finance's attempts to introduce multi-annual budgeting, and it will be unable do so unless the Oireachtas passes a law requiring a set percentage of GNP to be allocated for development aid annually from the Exchequer without having to use the Estimates procedure. This can be done by law.</P>
    <P>The servicing of the national debt, for example, is provided for by law, as is the payment of salaries to judges because those salaries cannot be diminished during service. Serious consideration should be given to legislating for meeting the 0.7 per cent in development aid by 2005 or whatever year &ndash; it does not have to be reached overnight. Consequently there would not be a wrangle every year, the Department of Finance would not be able to nobble the Department of Foreign Affairs and Members would not be able to get windy about it when it were introduced in the House.</P>
    <P>In 2005 0.7 per cent of GNP would be approximately £600 million but, as I argued in the policy document which I published on overseas development aid, structures should be put in place to audit this allocation in order to ensure efficient expenditure and reporting of such expenditure to the Oireachtas. Indeed, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should approve annually the areas in which the Minister intends to spend the money but not the money itself because that would be guaranteed by law. That is the only way this can be done.</P>
    <P>Ireland was devastated by famine in its recent history. I spoke to a woman who had spoken to somebody who had experienced the famine &ndash; it happened in our history. We, above everybody else, should give leadership on this. Let us not always wait to react to best practice in other countries. Let us make some headlines ourselves. We could do a magnificent job in the area of human rights if we provided leadership in meeting the overseas development aid target. It should be met through an Act of the Oireachtas and then pressure could be put on others. I hope the report of the Oireachtas Sub-committee on Human Rights will become the source of an annual debate in the House. These are issues to which we need to turn frequently.</P>

      <P>This is a particularly appropriate time for a debate on human rights in view of a number of current developments at home and abroad, such as the renewed ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, the increased number of asylum seekers in Ireland, the plight of the families of the disappeared, the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement and the commitment in that accord by both Governments to establish a human rights commission in each jurisdiction. All <Col N="36" /> these matters raise issues involving fundamental human rights.</P>
      <P>Last December the world marked the 50th anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, generally recognised as a definitive statement on human rights. The world in which it was drawn up is different from the modern world, but the values and ethos it espouses are as relevant today as they were then. The authors of the declaration were influenced by the horrific experiences of the Second World War and the attempts by the Nazi regime to exterminate entire categories of people. Indeed, it was the unprecedented activities of the Nazis that led a Polish lawyer, Raphael Lemkin, to coin the term &ldquo;genocide&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the 50 years since the adoption of the declaration, the world may have avoided carnage on the scale of the Second World War, but a day has not passed since 1948 when there has not been conflict and death in some part of the world. The Korean War and the Vietnam War took huge tolls. There have been various conflicts throughout Africa, there is no stability in the Middle East, the innocent continue to die in the former Yugoslavia and more than 3,000 people have perished on our own little island.</P>
      <P>Against the background of continuing violence and instability, as well as anti-democratic and repressive regimes, the sentiments of the universal declaration remain as valid as ever. In the 50 years since the declaration was adopted, we have seen the end of colonialism, the death of apartheid, the collapse of the communist countries of eastern Europe, the development of the television, computers and the information age and the emergence of a much more literate and informed population, yet there is scarcely a country of which it can be said that it honours in its entirety the spirit as well as the letter of the universal declaration.</P>
      <P>As a basic statement of human rights, the declaration has never been improved on. One of the best and simplest definitions of human rights which I have seen is &ldquo;those basic standards without which people cannot live in dignity&rdquo;. When we reflect on human rights, we tend to think in terms of freedom of political activity, freedom from persecution, protection against oppressive laws or unjust prosecution, but the declaration also sets out an entire range of rights such as the rights to work, education, housing, medical care, enjoy arts and share in scientific advancement and its benefits.</P>
      <P>Article 23, for instance, states that &ldquo;Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment&rdquo;. Despite the spectacular economic progress in Ireland, many of its citizens do not enjoy the rights set out in this article. When we come to look at how a country measures up to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we must consider its record under all headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Western countries have traditionally tended to <Col N="37" /> place most emphasis on political and civil rights but have attached less importance to economic rights such as social welfare, jobs and health care. Judged against the 29 articles of the declaration, Ireland would certainly not be the worst offender, but it would not be at the top of the class. Article 14 is particularly relevant to Ireland currently. It states that &ldquo;Everyone has the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution&rdquo;. In our treatment of asylum seekers we have fallen short of the spirit and letter of the declaration.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas introduced a comprehensive Refugee Act which set out fair and humane procedures for dealing with applications from asylum seekers, yet the Government has effectively shelved the Act, set aside the procedures contained in it and introduced a fast track, semi-secret system for dealing with applicants. This was done despite a motion passed by the Dáil with the support of all parties in December 1997 calling for the earliest possible operation of the Act. The numbers of persons seeking asylum in Ireland have been relatively small, especially when compared with other European countries. However, the official response has been harsh and unsympathetic. The response of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to have been driven by costs and the need for neat administrative procedures rather than the human needs of those involved. One would have thought those seeking refuge here could have expected more sympathetic and human treatment than they have received to date from a country that had sent so many of its own people abroad. The refusal to allow asylum seekers is a form of double discrimination. It discriminates against them by compelling them to remain on what are generally accepted as subsistence levels of income and this means asylum seekers have no independent means of their own and must remain dependent on the State for basic services such as housing and health care Given the length of time it takes to decide on the status of asylum seekers, this can go on for years. It also discriminates against asylum seekers because it leaves them open to the perception that they are spongers who are refusing to work and want to live off the State, when we know the truth is very different. This policy is also at variance with the normal social welfare code, which holds as a fundamental principle that to receive unemployment assistance, a person must be available for and actively seeking work. Yet we insist we will pay social welfare to asylum seekers only if they do not seek or take work. Is it any wonder the general public is confused? </P>
    <P>The right to work, as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights acknowledges, is a basic human right and one which should be respected regardless of the legal or citizenship status of those concerned. Apart from the human rights issues involved, there are also compelling economic reasons for asylum seekers being allowed to work. Asylum seekers are willing and able to <Col N="38" /> work if they are allowed and they also have a social and cultural contribution to make. It would not only save the Exchequer money in social welfare, housing and health costs but would increase revenue to the State through tax and PRSI payments. An end to the prohibition on working would not only improve the economic and social position of asylum seekers but would also make an enormous contribution to improving the relationship between asylum seekers and others in our community. I urge the Minister to take an immediate initiative in this regard.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, has been uncomfortable with the way in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has backtracked on commitments to improved procedures for dealing with asylum seekers and has, in effect, abandoned the fair and humane procedures set out in the Refugee Act, 1996. Asylum seekers are entitled to adequate legal advice and protection. Perhaps she could show us that the Progressive Democrats have a role in this Government other than to make up the numbers by insisting on the early establishment of an independent legal service for asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>Another area where we can draw inspiration from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the commitment given by this State in the Good Friday Agreement that we would establish a human rights commission. Unfortunately, almost 14 months on from the signing of the Agreement and nearly 13 months after the Agreement was ratified by the people, North and South, the Government has yet to even produce the required legislation. On the other hand, the British Government had the necessary legislation passed by Westminster before the end of last year, and a chief executive was appointed for the Northern Ireland Commission earlier this year. Last September this House voted to give extraordinary additional powers to the Garda arising from the Omagh bombing. Most people felt there was a case for strengthening the hands of the Garda to enable it to prevent similar outrages and to bring to justice those who inflicted death, suffering and destruction on such a scale in Omagh. However, it is our belief that such draconian powers need to be accompanied by additional safeguard to protect the interests of the innocent. A human rights commission could play a vital role in this regard. However, while all the stops were pulled out in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to facilitate the early publication and speedy enactment of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, no urgency of any kind is being attached by the Department to the establishment of the commission.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement sets out in general terms the functions of the commission. It would be independent of Government and its role would include reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and practices, providing information and promoting awareness of human <Col N="39" /> rights, considering draft legislation and, in appropriate cases, bringing court proceedings or providing assistance to individuals to do so.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to produce the promised human rights commission Bill reflects at worst a real lack of commitment to human rights and at best a failure to give human rights issues the priority they deserve. It is not a daunting task to produce such a Bill and, because of the failure of the Government to act, the Labour Party produced its own Private Members' Bill, the Human Rights Bill, 1998. This would make the European Convention on Human Rights part of our law, like almost all of the other 39 countries in the Council of Europe. It will mean Irish citizens will not need to go all the way to Strasbourg to get their rights under the convention enforced &ndash; they will be able to rely on the convention in the Irish courts. Of course, the right to go to Strasbourg will be unaffected. We are also proposing to implement a number of other key UN and Council of Europe conventions. We propose to oblige the Government to ratify the UN Race Discrimination and Torture Conventions as well as a number of other instruments. At a time when Ireland is seeking membership of the UN Security Council, it is absolutely necessary if we are to have any credibility in this area that we should ratify all of the key human rights conventions. We also propose the establishment of an independent human rights commission.</P>
    <P>Human rights has always been at the top of the Labour Party agenda. We view the protection of rights not as a convenient slogan but, in the words of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights, as the first obligation of Government. When we were in Government, Deputy Spring spearheaded the drafting and ratification of a number of key international human rights instruments, most notably the protocol setting up the new full time European Court of Human Rights, which came into force towards the end of last year.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt some of the worst abuses of human rights we have witnessed since the end of the Second World War have taken place during this decade in the former Yugoslavia. There were terrible atrocities in Bosnia and in Croatia and again in the past few months we have seen terrible crimes against humanity in Kosovo. People have been beaten, driven from their homes and separated from their families, women have been raped, children brutalised and traumatised and an unknown number of people killed, in so-called ethnic cleansing. In recent days there has been some hope that a political solution may be found to the conflict, but it would be cynical in the extreme if, in the course of negotiations, anyone were given immunity from crimes committed during the course of this conflict and especially for crimes committed in the name of ethnic cleansing. Nearly one million people have lost their homes in Kosovo in the past 14 months and three out of every four of them have been displaced in the last two months. According to the Organisation for <Col N="40" /> Security and Co-operation in Europe, the crimes committed against those people include killings, executions, physical abuse, rape, forced displacement, destruction of civilian property and looting, sexual assault, including rape of groups of women, torture, ill treatment, harassment, intimidation and the use of groups of people as human shields. That is an appalling list of abuses. By no means have all of the people so cruelly treated been accounted for. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that if and when the people of Kosovo return home, mass graves will be found as further evidence of the atrocities committed. It would be unthinkable if the people responsible for these crimes were now to be given immunity from prosecution in return for some compromise agreement.</P>
    <P>All of us want peace. All of us want the people of Kosovo to be able to return to their homes and begin the rebuilding of their lives and their communities. However, a peace deal which lets war criminals off the hook would bring further shame to the entire international community.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the current plight of the families of the so-called disappeared, who are going through an appallingly grim period. Having waited almost three decades to find out where their loved ones were buried by the IRA, they now face the prospect of perhaps weeks of searching for their remains. It is extraordinarily cynical on the part of the spokespersons for the republican movement to pretend they are acting in the interests of human rights when they identify what they claim to be the general location of the remains of people murdered by the republican movement in the early 1970s. I watched with growing horror, gardaí digging into the tarmacadam of a car park where the Republican movement claims the body of one of its innocent victims had been placed. These scenes highlight the depths which some human beings can plumb in their dealings with others. To add this grim trauma to that already suffered by the relatives who have been waiting for so many years to discover the location of the loved ones' remains is beyond belief.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with those who have criticised the media coverage of these searches. Leaving aside a number of insensitive interviews with some of the relatives, the media is playing an important role in bringing home to us the horror of what was done by the republican movement and loyalist organisations. If we are tempted to glorify the events of the past 30 years in Northern Ireland we should recall what these families are suffering. The republican movement has travelled a considerable distance in its adoption of the mores of democracy but it has some way to go in softening the stony hearts its members have acquired during 30 years of killing and abusing their fellow citizens.</P>
    <P>I listened with some distaste to an interview with Gerry Adams a few mornings ago, in which he refused to condemn the murders of these innocent people and the hiding of their remains. He <Col N="41" /> was only prepared to say that he was sorry for the pain caused by their deaths. He did not say he was sorry for the increased suffering caused by the failure of the IRA to identify the sites where the bodies are buried. I cannot believe that no one associated with the IRA knows precisely where even one of these bodies is buried. Mr. Martin McGuinness's claim that geological change may have something to do with this, beggars belief. If we are ever tempted to glorify the events of the past 30 years as a liberation struggle, we should remember the plight of the families of the &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; and the victims who were tortured and murdered by the IRA and loyalist gangs. That will curtail any tendency to imagine that those people are heroes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that debates such as this are held from time to time. Human rights, in Ireland or abroad, are universal and indivisible. Now more than ever, the family of nations is aware of what is happening in all parts of the world. Even when we did not have our modern methods of instant communication, the Irish people demonstrated their concern for human rights and it is important that we continue to adhere to the principles which have guided this nation since independence. We should be impatient of our progress but we should not accept the charge that, in the past, we have not been concerned about breaches of human rights throughout the world or that our human rights record is inconsistent. To do so would be an injustice to the efforts of many who went before us and an invitation to those countries who look to Ireland with respect and appreciation, to view us as hypocrites. It is not true to say that Ireland has neglected its duty to uphold standards of human rights.</P>
      <P>Human rights are indivisible and universal. They cover every aspect of life and relate to the most fundamental roles of Government. It is right that we should be impatient of our progress &ndash; although this has been considerable &ndash; in social welfare, health, prison reform, education and particularly equality of rights which was the basis of the struggle in which many gave their lives in 1916 and subsequently. Every Government and every Member of the Oireachtas has an obligation to set the highest standards in all those areas and at all times. We must continually test, question, criticise and, where appropriate attack &ndash; and I acknowledge and uphold the right to do so. However, we should not convey the impression that the Irish people are incapable of taking a lead in human rights issues or have been inconsistent in support of human rights throughout the world. That is not the case. We must recognise our leadership role and be aware of what others look to us to achieve. On many occasions we have discharged that role and, in co-operation with other small nations, have brought about significant changes in the interest of human rights beyond our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters of fundamental human rights are the <Col N="42" /> everyday business of this House and I do not propose to dwell on the issues of social welfare, education, housing or prisoners' rights. Housing is a fundamental right. I make one observation which I hope will be noted by those who say our housing conditions are appallingly inadequate. The physical housing stock provided by public authorities in Ireland exceeds the standards of housing in much wealthier countries. I have lived and worked in France, Belgium, Italy and many other countries.</P>

      <P>What is lacking is a social housing policy. All the vulnerable and deprived groups &ndash; unmarried mothers, battered and deserted wives &ndash; are being placed in the one community. Is it any wonder that there are social problems? For once there should be a degree of social enlightenment in housing programmes incorporating all age groups and then we might find that much of what we complain about is dealt with before the problems arise.</P>
      <P>The most fundamental right of all &ndash; the right to life &ndash; has been breached consistently by awful regimes. We are supposed to be living in an era of enlightenment. Not forgetting Rwanda, East Timor and places about which we have not heard, there is the genocide of the Kosovar people by the unspeakable regime of Milosevic in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>When people are brutalised and deprived of their fundamental rights it is a crime against all humanity. No one, by virtue of the cloak of power or authority, has the right to inflict torture and suffering on others. In such circumstances there is an obligation to be seen to take effective action.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to withhold visas from the Yugoslav football team has been supported by all parties. Regimes which go beyond the bounds of acceptable behaviour should be isolated, exposed and shown up for what they are &ndash; brutes who have no claim to the right to regulate the lives of the people under their control. It would be unthinkable to allow Milosevic and his regime to get away with the notion that what they are doing is acceptable to countries such as Ireland. I was not pleased, however, when attempts were made two days ago, for petty internal reasons, to imply that the Government was reluctant to take this step. It was obvious to all concerned that that was not the case. It was seeking to impose on UEFA the obligation to accept its responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> It is a disgrace that France, a big supplier of armaments, should play host to a Yugoslav sports team at a time when it is very much involved in the NATO bombing campaign, which is contrary to the principles of human rights. The impression is being conveyed that this is all right, even though the European Union has decided that the current regime in the former Yugoslavia should be treated as a pariah, outside the family of nations. This is hypocritical in the extreme.</P>
    <P>I have reason to believe that Government action in the area of sport against regimes which consider themselves acceptable works. The World Cup of Golf was to be held in Ireland in 1978 at the Waterville Lake Hotel which was owned by the late Jack Mulcahy who had put a lot of money into the preparations. It would have been a great occasion and generated international publicity. Our semi-State bodies, including Bord Fáilte and An Bord Bainne, were understandably encouraged to participate. Has it been forgotten that in April that year the then Government &ndash; I was privileged to be Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time &ndash; decided that Ireland should not host the competition at considerable cost in terms of tourism promotion? Other countries recognised that we were being consistent. The South Africans who were trying to give the impression that they were acceptable to the world realised that they were not acceptable here. Has it also been forgotten that another member state had no such qualms and hosted the competition instead?</P>
    <P>Has it been forgotten that it was the Irish Presidency that promoted the special conference in Geneva in 1979 on the Vietnamese boat people? I was privileged to greet the first of those refugees in Ireland. The notion should not always be conveyed that it is only now we are waking up. The Government's decision will hurt Milosevic and other brutes like him.</P>
    <P>Has it been forgotten that it was an Irish Government that promoted and received support in the United Nations for restrictions on the spread of the weaponry of death? Because of the fundamental stand taken by the late Frank Aiken, one of the most respected figures internationally, on human rights, other nations supported the Irish proposals on the spread of nuclear weapons and the limitation of arms.  I am happy the current Minister for Foreign Affairs is following in the same tradition, because it is essential. I would like to make something very clear in that connection. I feel a little like Cato in the Roman Senate when I say this, because I have said it so often, but the scandal of the export of and the trade in armaments at this stage of the human experience is crying out for a universal declaration of shame. Some of those with whom we associate in the European Union and with whom we propose to associate in the Partnership for Peace are engaged in that unspeakable trade without any regulation, control or code of ethics to guide it. I hope that because of the consistent voice to which <Col N="44" /> I referred we will be heard loud and clear telling those &ldquo;partners&rdquo; that if they want us as full partners, it will be on conditions acceptable to standards of human behaviour.</P>
    <P>There is no point looking at events after they happen, seeing the awful horrors in Rwanda or wherever and trying to do what we can to help. What will we do to ensure these unspeakable horrors are not perpetrated on innocent suffering wretches, in Africa, Kosovo or elsewhere, basically because armaments and equipment are available to those brutes or dictators in this world of free trade in armaments? I want to hear Ireland's voice raised. If it is raised consistently, as it has been, then maybe we will not have to attempt to deal with the consequences of that unspeakable brutality.</P>
    <P>One cannot speak of human rights without addressing an issue which is of fundamental concern at home and which was touched on by a number of Members, the residual tragedy of the awful experience of so many people in the North of Ireland, particularly those families who are again going through the agony of losing loved ones. Thirty years later these families are again suffering due to the searches taking place at this time. I want to associate myself with all in this House by saying it is unspeakable that anyone should attempt to add to the suffering of those innocent people. It is totally outside the limit of human tolerance that anyone should attempt to do that. I insist that, sooner rather than later, vigorous and effective efforts be made to ensure those bodies will be exhumed and returned to their loved ones, if their location is known.</P>
    <P>I pay particular tribute to a man from my own home town of Nenagh, Fr. Alec Reid, who has at all times stood for human rights in all its forms. Probably one of the best demonstrations of that was during that awful event in Milltown cemetery when those two British soldiers were done in. Fr. Alec Reid was able to kneel down and say a prayer over the bodies of those British soldiers. He is doing all he can to help to arbitrate in locating those bodies. I hope, please God, we will find the locations soon.</P>
    <P>The most important thing is life itself. I join with everyone in this House by saying I detest, abhor, reject and repudiate capital punishment in all its forms. It is unthinkable that some states in America, which claim to be civilised, still tolerate this unspeakable practice. Who gives any one man the right to take what he has not given &ndash; life? Who gives any one state the right to take what it has not conferred &ndash; life? Ireland has a great opportunity here in demonstrating its consistency. Just as we have no right to terminate life at the beginning &ndash; I hope our voice will be consistent in that regard as well &ndash; we have no right to terminate life before its natural end.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to correct the record of the House. This morning on the Order of Business I stated that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle received a letter from the Lough Muckno Action Committee in relation to electoral fraud in Castleblayney and that he had not replied. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has since contacted me stating that he did not receive any correspondence from the Lough Muckno Action Committee in relation to this matter and he has asked me to correct the record of the House, and I am happy to do so.</P>
      <P>I have since spoken to Mr. Joe Brennan of the Lough Muckno Action Committee who has confirmed that no letter was sent to Deputy O'Hanlon. However, he attempted to speak to Deputy O'Hanlon by telephone on 11 and 12 May in relation to the doctoring of the electoral register in Castleblayney. He further stated that he wrote, by registered post, to the General Secretary of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Martin Macken, but to date had received no response. I state clearly there is no implication whatsoever that the Office of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had any involvement in the serious irregularities in the electoral register in Castleblayney.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> When it comes to human rights and the discussion on it, there is scarcely a subject which involves more hypocrisy on the part of those taking part. Human rights, as far as international politics and the major political forces are concerned, is really a badge of convenience. It is something with which to belt one's political opponents in different parts of the world in order to secure ends which are far from human rights but rather economic, military or political advantage.</P>
      <P>At present NATO is engaged in a bombing campaign in the Balkans. The human rights of the Kosovars is the only reason given for that action. The brutal regime of Milosevic is correctly demonised but that demonisation is the sole excuse for the campaign. This is absolute and utter hypocrisy on the part of the major NATO powers when, at the same time as paying lip-service to human rights in the Balkans, they are blind to other grotesque abuses of human rights equal to those of Milosevic happening in other parts of the world and, even worse, being perpetrated by members of the very organisation, NATO, claiming to take a stand for human rights in the Balkans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turkey is one of the most prominent members of NATO and is valued by the United States, Britain and other countries. Yet, for decades, particularly in the south-east of the country, it has waged a vicious, prolonged and brutal war against an entire nation of Kurdish people within the borders of Turkey. About 15 million people have lived for a long time under a vicious state of emergency. As Amnesty International, Helsinki <Col N="45" /><Col N="46" /> Watch and other human rights groups have documented repeatedly, Turkey has been guilty of grotesque abuses of human rights against the Kurdish people and those who are opposed to what is currently happening in Turkey. Not only is there a military campaign within the borders of this NATO country, but the rights of the Kurdish people to enjoy freedom of culture, language and national expression are brutally repressed. Even their language is not recognised; it is forbidden and repressed in the education system, broadcasting and publishing under the diktat that everything in the country must be Turkish.</P>
    <P>This is an incredible state of affairs. Equally incredible is the silence of the leaders of western countries in NATO which claim to stand for and respect democratic and human rights and the silence of the Irish Government and the main political parties in the House. I am sorry Deputy Gay Mitchell could not remain in the House &ndash; like me he has many commitments. The last time we discussed this matter, which was only a few weeks ago, Deputy Gay Mitchell on behalf of Fine Gael denounced Milosevic and stood up for the actions being taken against the Milosevic regime. However, he shifted uncomfortably in his seat when I reminded him that NATO was turning a blind eye to Turkey and said that issue was for another day. It is not for another day and it is outright hypocrisy that this issue is not being highlighted. If the Government and political parties are serious about standing up for human rights, it is issues such as this that should be raised.</P>
    <P>The other day I questioned the Taoiseach about the attitude of the Government towards the bombing campaign, in particular the appalling and growing casualty list of innocent civilians, both ethnic Albanians and innocent Serbs, resulting from the NATO bombing. The Taoiseach got quite impatient and narked when I suggested the Government had a certain moral responsibility for this appalling damage, injury and death being inflicted on innocent civilians by virtue of the signing of a declaration by EU heads of state to the effect that the bombing campaign was inevitable. Successive Governments have followed the leading countries of NATO slavishly, particularly the diktats of the Pentagon and US Administrations, when it comes to international foreign policy, and have slavishly refused to condemn anything that is done by them even when it is absolutely indefensible. For example, the US fired rockets into the Sudan, allegedly to take out a terrorist organisation. Subsequent evidence showed that what was bombed was an innocent factory. We did not utter a word of condemnation against that particular violation of human rights. I am afraid that when people stand up and condemn human rights abuses in this country it is done quite selectively and in line with the interests the Government has, or believes it has, in remaining friends with the leading countries of NATO.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> According to a reply by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to a parliamentary question tabled by me on 26 May 1999, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has given licences for dual goods, that is, goods which could be used for civilian or military warfare. Of these, four licences have been granted for integrated circuits for products sold to Turkey while one licence has been granted for the sale of aircraft related equipment. Does the Government or the Department know or have they taken steps to see if any of this equipment is used in the campaign against the Kurdish people? Similarly, in the context of other countries which have deplorable records in human rights, have successive Governments taken measures to establish, or do they care, whether the products for which licences are issued are used to quash human rights or bolster the positions of regimes?</P>
    <P>The history of western powers in the context of human rights, which has been followed by the current and previous Governments, is one of double standards in the extreme. There is example upon example of this. The US thought it should go to war in 1990 when Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded Kuwait. Of course, a few years earlier when Saddam Hussein poisoned the people of Halabja village with a monstrous gas attack the US turned a blind eye. Why would it do otherwise when it had been arming and supporting the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and other dictatorships? It was not until the US oil supply was threatened by the dictator it had helped create and who was getting too big for his boots that the US took action.</P>
    <P>The hypocrisy of developments over the past 20 or 30 years is evident. The result is that, unfortunately, the peoples of the world cannot rely on these powers to defend their human rights because the defence of human rights is strictly secondary to naked economic and military interests. We had the extreme example in 1973 of a democratically elected Government in Chile being overthrown brutally and tens of thousands being murdered with the direct connivance of the US Administration and its agencies. This shows that the peoples who are repressed and downtrodden must rely primarily on their own resources and secondarily on international solidarity between the peoples of other countries, but they may not rely on the military and political establishments which have double standards.</P>
    <P>In the course of two months the plight of the unfortunate people of Kosovo has been disastrously exacerbated by the appalling miscalculations of NATO's bombing. This has allowed the dictator Milosevic to do in two months what he could not have achieved in years. With the encouragement of the Serb opposition &ndash; the people who hate Milosevic &ndash; who stand for democracy and human rights in Serbia, Milosevic would be overthrown before he could succeed in doing anything to the extent to which he has succeeded under the cover of NATO bombs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, is here representing the Government. I want her to take this opportunity to condemn the use of cluster bombs by NATO in residential areas in the Balkans. It is surely a crime to use bombs which are designed to inflict death and maim personnel, including civilians.</P>
    <P>Other matters relating to this country have been mentioned. There is the question of the few thousand people seeking asylum here, many of whose cases have been in the pipeline for many years, who are still being denied the right to work in the State. The right to work, the dignity which comes from work and the economic rewards from work are fundamental to the enjoyment of life and to having the means to live in reasonable comfort. To continue to deny to those few thousand people this fundamental right is a gross denial of a basic human right. The Minister of State or whoever will reply to the debate on behalf of the Government should specify why the Government is continuing to deny this at a time when FÁS is sending recruiters around Europe looking for 10,000 people to fill positions which it cannot fill. That is deplorable, to say the least.</P>
    <P>The plight of children over many decades in institutions run by the religious has been dramatically highlighted of late and that is as it should be. We have seen the perversion of State institutions which put a terrible burden on a generation of people who went through them and we must pay the cost. Happily, at last restitution is about to be made and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>However, VOCAL Ireland, which stands for Victims Of Child Abuse Laws, is a small group of people who allege that they have been falsely accused of sexual abuse of children often in the background of the context of bitter matrimonial or partnership separations, etc. Were anybody to be so accused it would be a monstrous perversion of his or her human rights and of any standards of justice and decency, but the group feels quite isolated at present because, naturally and correctly, the impulse of the vast majority in society is to protect children and to expose child abuse and bring it out of the closet where it was hidden for so long and nothing must cut across that. However, if there are cases, as is alleged by these people who are passionately convinced that they have been falsely accused, then they must be heard also.</P>
    <P>In documentation which VOCAL Ireland sent to me and many Members of the Dáil in recent months, the group included the notes of a meeting between one of the groups representing these people and a principal officer of the Department of Health and Children. The principal officer's minute states:</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the possibility that an injustice may have been done in one or more of the cases raised by the Group, most of which relate to the mid-1980's when our services for <Col N="49" /> investigating allegations of child sexual abuse were not as developed as they are today.</P>
    <P>The official further stated that this raises the question of restoring individuals' good names and/or providing compensation for distress, etc. The minute further states:</P>
    <P>Short of establishing a Statutory Inquiry, it would be impossible for us to have the original evidence reviewed . .</P>
    <P>An inquiry should be set up to examine the serious grievances of this group of people who are a small minority. It would establish the truth, allow them to tell their story and resolve what may be a serious miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>Human rights touch on all aspects of human life. People have referred here to the situation in prisons, the fact that prisoners come from the deprived sections of society and the implications of that.</P>
    <P>People have referred to the housing problem. That is quite correct except that when it was being raised by the main political parties they failed to draw the conclusion that the economic system which dominates society, that is, capitalism, is responsible for a systematic denial of human rights in that regard.</P>

        <b>:</b> Any totalitarian system is an abomination. The denial of the basic right to shelter and to live in comfort is a denial of human rights, but it is the existing system and the profiteering and racketeering by a small cabal of respected people in society, house builders, landowners, etc., which is bringing this about. Correcting that abuse of human rights means changing and challenging the system of greed and profit of a few in society. I doubt the parties, which are paid large contributions by those individuals, will rise to that challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins is consistent in his approach to this and other debates, that is, if America is involved, then the opposition is right regardless of the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a helpful approach and we have seen it in the past from him and other individuals. In the past they had a clear option, it was East versus West, but that is not an option since the collapse of the Russian inspired regime. Now it is the case that anyone the Americans are against, must be right. That blinkered approach has not helped anybody. It has not helped the various factions throughout the world fighting different wars and it has not helped to curb the real causes of trouble. Whichever side one takes, a knee-jerk reaction is unhelpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast there is Deputy O'Kennedy's call, which I support, that the Parliament and the <Col N="50" /> Government should speak out against our partners in Europe for their involvement in the horrendous arms trade. That is the approach which we should take, criticising the wrong regardless of where it is sourced. Wearing blinkers and assuming the Yanks are the big bad boys or <i>vice versa</i>, is to lose ground.</P>
    <P>I strongly support Deputy O'Kennedy's call. The European and other industrialised countries involved in this trade are the real criminals. They provide arms which create mayhem throughout the world. In a debate such as this we tend to focus on the latest flashpoint. Many wars are ongoing throughout the world to which the people referred to by Deputy O'Kennedy are providing ammunition. Will the Minister inform the House of the steps being taken by Government to support Deputy O'Kennedy's call? </P>
    <P>It is necessary to break into various segments any discussion on human rights. We must discuss local issues such as housing and the plight of the elderly who are unable to leave their homes for fear of attack. We must also consider the situation in the North. We must seek solutions to the various issues involved. The arms trade is a serious factor in the denial of human rights throughout the world and I would like to know what we are doing to address that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Higgins had his way, we would probably shift the country a bit further east. He was one of the people who came into the House in recent days and suggested Ireland was doing nothing about the football match which was due to take place this weekend. Even prior to 11 May our Ministers had taken action on the issue. Last week in this House people were reacting to the latest newspaper headlines. On 11 May the Minister for Foreign Affairs urged that UEFA would reconsider its decisions to proceed with matches involving the Yugoslav regime.</P>
      <P>Having participated in a range of sports over the years, my gut feeling is that politics should be kept out of sports. However, that is impossible to achieve at this level. We saw the manner in which the campaign against apartheid was assisted by the decisions of various countries not to participate in sporting events with that regime. Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the decision taken in 1978 not to participate in the golfing world cup. That cost Ireland dearly.</P>
      <P>The possible loss of points and revenue in regard to the football match was referred to. That is small change where human life is concerned. I am glad we took the decision not to grant visas. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation made his position on the matter very clear a while ago, as did Deputies O'Kennedy and O'Donnell, and it was unfair for Members to state otherwise in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tend to deal with issues which are removed from us. We are experts on problems and situations on the other side of the world and are tot<Col N="51" /> ally committed to seeking solutions to them. For a long time, we were unable to grasp the difficulties in the North. The Good Friday Agreement is the most successful political achievement ever made on this island. An issue which successive Governments failed to tackle has finally been tackled. People were murdered and maimed but very little was done about that. It was suggested that the matter was too sensitive and that it involved people's traditions and rights. All manner of rights appeared to take precedence over human rights. I welcome the fact that we are now moving in the right direction on this issue although a great deal of work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>We must look after the home patch. We tend to focus on macro issues. I am not comparing the problem of homelessness with people being murdered or bombed. However, there are issues here at home which should be tackled. We are particularly failing to tackle the plight of the elderly who live in fear. In spite of the availability of security alarms and other devices, we are failing to highlight the dangerous conditions in which elderly people live, having built the State for us. People are not being asked to become socially involved in their communities and we are not stressing the hard-earned rights of the elderly. Many elderly people do not enjoy the full range of human rights. Various categories of people, such as lone parents, have been referred to and the deprivation they suffer has been highlighted. Some people would assert that they are being ghettoised. However, the rights of the elderly is the issue which troubles me most.</P>
    <P>Rape is one of the greatest infringements on human rights in this State. We have been very slow to recognise the seriousness of the crime and the trauma and difficulties experienced by victims. Rape victims have been forced through the legal system, people who have suffered horrendous attacks have had to go into court to fight their cases. The judicial system has tended to lean towards the perpetrators rather than the victims.</P>
    <P>Cases can arise in which people feel they are victimised. As Deputy Higgins stated, fathers may feel they have been wrongly accused of crimes against their children. However, I feel the scales are often unfairly tipped in favour of the criminal and of more affluent and articulate people who can highlight their cases. That occurs to the detriment of smaller groups in society who are less capable of speaking up for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is doing an excellent job representing this country internationally. However, I would like to see increased emphasis on the national situation. It is easier in some ways to play on the world stage than to deal with situations which arise under our noses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins talked about people such as builders making money &ndash; his usual hobbyhorse &ndash; but the other side of that argument is the failure of councillors to rezone land and to take decisions that should have been taken many years ago. That failure to make land available affects <Col N="52" /> young people trying to build homes, but that is a separate issue which can be dealt with elsewhere. A begrudging approach is often taken towards a person who becomes very wealthy because his or her family owned a farm in a particular location. As a result of that begrudging attitude, people failed to take action.</P>
    <P>We are all culpable. I like to think I am playing a role because I happen to be chairman of a community council. I also try to get my family involved, but that is not always the answer. I have to react to suggestions and ideas put forward by articulate people in pressure groups or other organisations, and I am conscious we are leaving out the elderly. The new organisation, Parliament for the Elderly, is beginning to fight its case but those individuals will be left behind if we are not conscious of their needs. Human rights are not about the world stage, they are about each individual person.</P>
    <P>We are probably widening the debate by talking about housing needs, etc. but we have taken a blinkered approach to this issue. We tend to focus on the macro issues. Every time we have statements in this House they are about the latest conflict in the world; we tend to forget about events that occurred three, four or five years ago. People have said to me that the world will never see another Hitler. That is rubbish. We have seen, not too far from home, how people are capable of carrying out any atrocity and, if they had the wherewithal, they would be like Hitler. We must always be vigilant in that regard. We must be conscious of the other person's needs while being prepared to act, regardless of how small the issue.</P>
    <P>Considering the size of our country on the world stage, our record is impeccable. As a neutral country we are respected because we have spoken out in the past on various issues. I have total confidence in our team of Ministers who travel abroad. They are respected because they speak out on issues. I am proud of that but I ask them not to forget the micro issues that affect the people at home, the elderly, who gave us what we currently have.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate and I wish the Minister of State well in her endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject which covers a wide spectrum and affects the quality of life of so many people throughout the world. Listening earlier to our good friend and colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins, I tried to reach a conclusion on the number of sentiments he expressed with which one could agree. This proved that regardless of how much one might disagree with somebody on ideological grounds, that person is sure to say something at some stage with which one agrees, and that happened in the case of Deputy Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the more ridiculous notions put forward by him, however, was that exports have alternative uses. He mentioned circuit boards but one could mention a variety of items such as the roller bearing or the oil retaining seal, crucial items in <Col N="53" /> the war machine. The microchip is another item with which everybody identifies. It is remarkable the way people identify an item manufactured in this country, which has a positive use throughout the world, as something to be treated with suspicion because it has alternative uses. I will never understand the logic of that argument.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's suggestion could be extended to include the export of the wheel, which can be used as part of a war machine. One could also mention the axe. It was not necessary to import any high technology for use in the war in Rwanda because the genocide there was perpetrated in a very basic manner. One of the reasons for that genocide was the incitement to hatred by people who were allowed spew out their message of hatred until the situation eventually exploded. This applies not only to Rwanda but to every country. The question of allowing people to use the airwaves or other platforms to get across their messages of hatred or narrow-minded attitudes, which are directed at their enemies, should be addressed in all abuses of human rights that take place throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins could have also mentioned the internal combustion engine, an important item in a war machine. However, all the items referred to are equally effective in terms of a peace machine. That part of the Deputy's argument is not sustainable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins appeared to adopt an anti-American attitude which tends to cloud the judgment of many people, particularly in this area. Virtually every Member would have had reservations from time to time about American foreign policy in various regions of the world, and spoken about it at the time, but we should not allow our vision to be clouded. There were very few alternatives to the intrusions, in more recent times, by NATO and various American influenced agencies over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy said earlier that, until recently, he believed there could never be another Hitler. There have been many Hitlers on a smaller scale since 1945 and we should not forget that the free-thinking people of the world could have called a halt before the Holocaust occurred, but no one did anything about it. Deputy Higgins mentioned American involvement today. Americans refused to get involved on that occasion because there was a strong anti-war campaign at that time in the United States. Domestic policy kept them out of that area. The result was not that several hundred thousand people were killed, as is happening today, but 60 million people died because someone carried out an experiment and no one shouted stop. In the beginning everyone thought there were reasons for this, and of course there are reasons for and reactions to everything. The Treaty of Versailles and its consequences were cited as one of the fundamental causes &ndash; so what? Did that justify the killing of 60 million people?</P>
    <P>Some say that Ireland is a neutral country which should stay out of this issue as our neu<Col N="54" /> trality has stood us in good stead for all these years. I often wonder what would have happened if one of the powers in World War II had decided that Ireland was a strategic location which should be invaded. Would we have been able to defend ourselves? The answer is no. We would have protested for a short while but those protests would have been snuffed out. Our civil rights would have been pushed aside. The idea of invading Ireland did occur to some of the powers and considerable plans existed to do so.</P>
    <P>Some suggest that we would have achieved different results at the end of the war. I shudder to think of what would have happened in that scenario. At this time in our development as a nation we must take a stand, speak our minds and follow that up by committing ourselves in a European and worldwide manner to preventing the erosion of human rights. We cannot afford to sit on the fence any longer and pretend that the rest of the world is passing us by and that we have no involvement in or responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>Human rights abuses are abundant in various locations throughout the world. Deputy Joe Higgins mentioned Turkey as the primary abuser of human rights. I am sure abuses occur in Turkey, but the Turks would argue that their case is not always heard and that may be the case. Turkey has different traditions and, perhaps, sees its case somewhat differently.</P>
    <P>However, considerable levels of abuse are taking place in many other regions, some of which the Minister of State visited recently. These regions include East Timor, Kosovo, Rwanda, Algeria, Nigeria, China, Pakistan &ndash; the list goes on. There is no point in pretending that only one nation, group or ideology is responsible for all the abuses. There are many groups responsible, including some in Latin America.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to housing which I have spoken about for many years. This is a serious issue in my constituency as too many people are looking for too few houses and there is no way to meet the demand. Some people argue about how this should be resolved, but one cannot house people unless there are houses in which to put them.</P>
    <P>Given our economic prosperity we must ask ourselves whether the conditions in which many people are housed are compatible with what we would expect at this stage of our development. The answer is no. One sees deprivation, not poverty, in various locations where people are deprived of the means of achieving a reasonable quality and standard of life. Conditions such as overcrowded housing may have been acceptable at the turn of the century but they are not acceptable today. The human rights of such people are being seriously eroded. If people are treated in this way one cannot expect them to achieve any quality of life or get a job in a competitive market as they are stigmatised by where they come from and their unfortunate conditions.</P>
    <P>We have come to accept the erosion of these people's rights because such conditions were <Col N="55" /> acceptable in the past. However, they are not, nor should they be, acceptable in the current economic climate. We must tackle this problem. We must ask whether these people have the right to aspire to good quality homes in reasonable surroundings. We have a serious question to answer if we are not providing them with such conditions.</P>
    <P>Some single income families living on a reasonable income of, perhaps, £35,000 per year cannot afford to buy a house. What should such people do? What are we offering them? How can they achieve their rights? It used to be said that leasing and renting were the answers to all our problems. That was nonsense as the reverse is the case &ndash; the more property that falls into the hands of landlords the greater the tendency for rents to increase and the greater the difficulty people have in gaining access to property. I cannot understand why we are going around in circles in attempting to address this issue.</P>
    <P>Some speakers referred to human rights and sport. Sport can be regarded as an exercise in public relations. Our sports people are our PR people when they go abroad and the sporting achievements of other nationalities also represent a PR effort for those countries. The sneers coming from sporting opponents in the past few days to the effect that Ireland was afraid to play a football match sound hollow coming from such a source and given the atrocities perpetrated by those countries in Kosovo. It is hollow for such countries to expect to be able to indulge in a PR exercise in sport while continuing to apply that kind of regime at home. What do they think this is about? It is time these countries and individual sports people were brought to their senses as they have their own views on what should apply to themselves and, particularly, to those they might see as lesser human beings.</P>
    <P>FIFA has a great deal to answer for. What does FIFA think about the atrocities in Kosovo? Does it think it should take one side or that sport is above such events? Does it think there is nothing it can do about this situation? I do not accept that view. FIFA has an involvement and it should not pretend that these things are not happening. It should have taken action long ago but it did not do so.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by a number of other speakers to asylum seekers and refugees. We need to examine our behaviour in that regard also. As Deputy Joe Higgins said, it is ironic that this country, which currently has approximately 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees seeking admission and determination of their status, has failed to come to a clear-cut decision about their future, while at the same time, institutions of the State are obliged to go outside the country in an effort to recruit people to fill employment positions that cannot be filled otherwise. That is daft; it is time we copped on to ourselves.</P>
    <P>When discussing human rights, one must also ask about access to vital, life saving services, such <Col N="56" /> as hospital and general health services. What about the person who is vulnerable or suffers from a life threatening illness who needs access to surgical or other medical facilities in what they and their consultant consider to be an emergency? To what extent do we address their fears, concerns or worries with reasonably ready access? We can, perhaps, suggest that they be dealt with in two or three years time if they are prepared to be put on a waiting list. However, that attitude might have been fine at the turn of the century when there were no waiting lists, for different reasons, but it is no longer acceptable. I do not understand why we cannot simply address an issue that obviously affects the human rights of a large group of people, whether young, old or middle-aged. This is a matter we should examine seriously. Those people's rights are being eroded.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by referring to the abuse which took place in institutions either controlled or funded by the State and which has occupied the minds of people in this country in recent weeks. Many have thrown up their hands in horror, saying this should never have happened and claiming that nobody knew anything about it. The latter claim is not correct. Such abuses were known and many people mentioned them. Many people, inside and outside the institutions, brought the abuse to the attention of the authorities at the time. Some even raised it in this House. However, nobody wanted to hear about it. That is the reality. Bearing this in mind, we should always be extremely careful about pointing the finger. We have a tendency to point the finger at somebody else when we should be ready to point it at ourselves from time to time.</P>
    <P>We should consider the institutions throughout the country which catered for many categories of people. I will never forget a visit to one such institution about 16 years ago. I met an elderly lady there who had spent 17 years on the one floor of the same building. I am sure some people thought that lady's human rights were not being eroded, but I must admit to having been shocked. It must also be pointed out that hers was not an isolated case.</P>
    <P>I will finish where I started. With regard to the erosion and potential erosion of human rights, incitement to hatred and unbridled outbursts of hatred by people who are often in pivotal positions of authority is, and will continue to be, the largest single threat to human rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal first with an aspect of human rights on this island before referring to the issue with an international perspective. When people in Ireland discuss human rights, we appear to be under the impression that it is a foreign problem. However, we need only look at certain places in this country to realise that it is not. I would draw attention to two places in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is the streets of Belfast where, almost on a nightly basis, republican and loyalist thugs administer what they describe as justice to innocent people, who have not been convicted of any<Col N="57" /> thing, by mutilating them for life. We are, in a sense, almost comparable to the people of certain countries who have seen appalling atrocities and have learned to live with them. We barely comment on these occurrences. This House has the privilege of having, among its Members, somebody who speaks for those who perpetrate these deeds. However, it is apparently impolite to raise them.</P>
    <P>Another sight in this country which has become common over the last six days is that of gardaí digging for the bodies of people murdered by republican thugs. In some cases they are digging within view of the relatives of the person who is believed to be buried at the site. Day after day these relatives must watch. The return of these bodies was described, by no less a person than the great one himself, Mr. Gerry Adams, as a human rights issue. How right he is. It was also a human rights issue when those people were murdered 25 or more years ago. It has been a human rights issue that their relatives have been deprived of their remains for more than a quarter of a century. However, it is only recently that Mr. Adams and his cohorts became concerned about it.</P>
    <P>I call on the so-called republican movement to end the nightmare of the families of the disappeared whom it murdered. These families have been singled out for terrible treatment by the IRA and its political wing. Their relatives were abducted and murdered, they were denied information about their whereabouts for 25 years or more, they were not allowed to give them a Christian burial and they were never given the chance to grieve properly as bereaved relatives.</P>
    <P>Not content with that, Sinn Féin-IRA is now, apparently, determined to cause further pain to the relatives. It is grotesque in the extreme that the IRA is unwilling to provide the information necessary to locate the bodies of the people whom it murdered. There is a strong moral obligation on the current Sinn Féin leadership to help the relatives. Some of those leaders may well have ordered the murders in the first place. Some of them may have given instructions for the secret disposal of the bodies.</P>
    <P>This Parliament and the British Parliament, in order to assist the families, gave immunity to the murderers. With the benefit of hindsight, and if the locations of the bodies are not revealed, one must ask whether that was wise. Either the so-called republican movement accepts the values of a civilised and democratic society or it does not. It signalled in recent years that it wanted to make the transition from paramilitarism to parliamentarianism. There must be serious doubts about that unless it is willing to resolve this situation.</P>
    <P>Many decent men and women will seek election to various institutions on 11 June. These people would have too much respect for the law and for human rights to engage in the type of &ldquo;community activities&rdquo; that are the political trade mark of Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin and the IRA have never had anything but contempt for the State, its institutions and police force, several of whom <Col N="58" /> they murdered. The people should remember this when they go to the polls on Friday week. Before they  consider voting for Sinn Féin, they should think of the relatives standing in a lonely vigil in different locations around the country while the Garda tries to locate the bodies of their loved ones. The only crime of at least one of these loved ones was that she tried to comfort a dying solider. I am not yet convinced that the self-styled republican movement is capable of graduating from gangsterism to government.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Government decided yesterday to refuse visas to the Yugoslavian international football team which was due to play Ireland next Saturday. It was right to do so. To have allowed those people to use the match as a means of propaganda would have been appalling when the head of that state has already been indicted as a war criminal for grave breaches of human rights, as have many of his colleagues and strongest supporters, such as Arkan, Mladic and Karadzic. None of them has been brought before the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, but I hope they, along with Milosevic, will soon be tried there for the crimes they committed, not just against the Kosovan people, but also against the Bosnians and many others within the former republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>I heard the news at lunch-time which suggested there was a ray of hope. We were told, not very explicitly, that it appears President Milosevic has accepted the G8 proposals in respect of Kosovo and that the Serbian Parliament has endorsed that decision overwhelmingly. I am not sure this means very much. Past experience suggests that this is a ploy to gain time to regroup because of the pressure under which Milosevic and his regime have been put by the actions of NATO over the past two months or more. I will believe their willingness to leave Kosovo when I see them go. As it was put this morning by the UK Secretary of State for Defence, a resolution of the Serbian Parliament will not encourage one Kosovan refugee to return to their homes. They would be very foolish if they did so before an international force was in place to guarantee their safety. However, the situation is not without hope. If the truth is being told on this occasion by people who did not tell it in the past, perhaps there is some hope.</P>
    <P>The action which had to be taken to achieve this was taken by a regional force in the world and was not taken by the United Nations. This should be a cause for great regret to us all. The world finds itself in something of a dilemma. If the United Nations cannot cope with the type of genocide we witnessed in Bosnia, Rwanda, Burundi, the former Zaire and Kosovo, the free world, which does not want to see tyranny rise again, must have some means of ensuring that in accordance with international law. Such law will have to develop independently of the United Nations and its charter. It is that charter which is the root of the problem for the United Nations <Col N="59" /> and of the frustration of its distinguished Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan.</P>
    <P>The question Members must ask, as must people around the world, is why the UN Charter should be so difficult to amend and modernise as to cause the UN to be legally stultified and sterilised and, as a result, politically paralysed? It does not make sense that an institution formed in San Francisco in 1945 to reflect conditions in the world at the end of the Second World War should, almost without change, be expected to cope with the very different conditions which exist in the world in 1999, 54 years later. The root of the problem is the almost impossible task of amending the charter. It has been amended only seven or eight times in 54 years and all those amendments were procedural; none was substantive or political.</P>
    <P>No country would impose on itself a constitution which was incapable of amendment, reform or updating. Why, therefore, should the world impose on itself an institution which is incapable of amendment or reform? It is badly in need of reform. This arises because the UN is dominated by the five permanent members of the Security Council. They were thought to be the five appropriate countries in 1945 and perhaps they were at the time. They were the United States, the then Soviet Union, now represented by the Russian Federation, the then China of Chiang Kai-shek, now succeeded by communist China, France and the United Kingdom. The last two countries were perhaps powers of world significance at the time. They had large empires and they were also on the winning side in the Second World War, thanks to the help of their allies, especially those across the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>How can permanent power in the world for all time be justified for those five countries to the exclusion of countries such as Germany and India &ndash; the largest democracy in the world and which has preserved it for over half a century against all the odds in a huge and diverse place &ndash; Brazil, Japan and, even on population terms, a country such as Indonesia? How can we ban an entire continent such as Africa, which has a huge population and faces the greatest need, from the seat of power for all time? Why should African people have no say? Why can they not be represented by a country such as Nigeria, which will hopefully again become a democracy, or the Republic of South Africa, which has just held its second set of free and fair elections?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State provided a good summary of the situation earlier when she stated:</P>
    <P>No less a person than the Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has criticised the &ldquo;hopelessly divided Security Council&rdquo; and the &ldquo;capricious&rdquo; way that members of the Council, including members with permanent seats, have used their votes and thereby failed to live up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>She further stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> He reminded the world that when people are suffering through war, and the cruelties and mass terror inflicted on civilian populations by military forces, they must have a forum which will be responsive to their calls for defence and assistance.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with that and with the views of the Secretary General. However, I must ask the following question. Why should it be that the world can come to the aid of people who are maltreated in the way described by the Secretary General if that maltreatment is inflicted on them by the forces of another country but that it must stand by powerless if such maltreatment is inflicted on them by the rulers of their own country? What is the moral difference? Is the world not, in a sense, stultifying itself morally if it states that a difference exists? How can one say to a Kosovar woman who was raped ten times last night by members of Milosevic's forces that the crime is excusable because it was carried out by the rulers of her country but that if it had been perpetrated by members of a Greek, Bulgarian, Romanian or Italian invasion force, the world would pay attention and go about redressing the wrong? That is ridiculous, but it is the reality to which the international community must face up.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we can proceed in the same way we have done heretofore. We cannot allow people to make excuses for those who would seek to perpetuate the system to which I refer. It sickens me to have to listen to the hypocritical comments of some members of the left who state that the United States Government, NATO and the democracies are always wrong in seeking to enforce or vindicate human rights. Instead we are supposed to hanker back to the days when certain Members of this House who had friends in the Kremlin believed that the Soviet Union should stand up for the rights of the poor and the oppressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what has been said in this debate and I appreciate the detailed and reflective contributions made by Deputies, a number of whom are former Ministers with experience in this field.</P>
      <P>It is important to give the House as full a picture as possible of the most recent developments in the region, particularly in relation to the situation of the refugees. I will briefly outline the initial findings of the UN inter-agency visit to Serbia and Kosovo. The UN Co-ordinator for Humanitarian Affairs, Mr. De Mello, who led the delegation, met yesterday with UN member states' heads of mission, <i>en route </i>to New York, where, I understand, he is to brief the Security Council later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Kosovo, while access was restricted, Mr. Mello did confirm &ldquo;beyond any possible doubt&rdquo; the pattern of human rights violations presented by Mrs. Robinson. Civilians had been subject to displacement using threats, shellings and executions. Private property &ndash; homes, shops, <Col N="61" /> land, vehicles and livestock &ndash; had been systematically destroyed. He foresaw that a primary need in the post conflict phase would be protection, Kosovo would have to be &ldquo;saturated&rdquo; with an international presence.</P>
    <P>In relation to Serbia, he said the team was well received by Government and the public in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He had not requested a meeting with Mr. Milosevic, perhaps conscious of the cancellation of a meeting between Milosevic and Mary Robinson. There was clearly a lack of understanding by the Serbian civilian population of what is happening. The media is tightly controlled and only a small elite is aware of the context and scope of events in Kosovo. Civilian casualties in Serbia are at deplorable levels. Unemployment levels are very high and a preoccupation for all. The health and environmental impact of attacks on some chemical facilities are a cause of great concern as is the extent of damage to water, electrical and telecommunications facilities. The education system has been paralysed since mid-March and stress levels among the young appear to be very high. Damage to the industrial and agricultural infrastructure is high. Problems posed by unexploded ordnance in Serbia and Montenegro will need attention as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>Before moving on from the refugee situation, I would like to say a few words about winterisation of the camps. Activity on this issue is being carried out mainly within the UN system. It is clear that the focus on winterisation will concentrate on reinforcing the host family concept, supporting and developing collective centres and developing and, where necessary, relocating camps. I understand that initial &ldquo;brainstorming&rdquo; in Geneva has thrown up some doubts with regard to ultimate responsibility for what many feel is a challenge so daunting that it sets a test for the UN which it cannot pass. It will be a matter for all our consciences if we fail this test.</P>
    <P>As I speak, the House will be aware that important negotiations are taking place in Belgrade to find a political solution to the Kosovo crisis on the basis of the principles agreed by the G8 countries, including Russia, in early May. The EU is represented at these negotiations by its special envoy, the President of Finland. These negotiations are extremely complex but their objective is clear, namely, an unambiguous and viable agreement which will bring an end to the violence by the Serbian forces, a withdrawal of these forces from Kosovo and the setting in place of secure conditions which will allow for the return of the refugees.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will support me in wishing every success to the international negotiators, particularly in light of the magnitude and complexity of their task. We should not be under any illusions about the reality and seriousness of the task they face. In view of the best case scenario and given the early start of winter and the devastation on the ground within Kosovo, the number of refugee returns this year would be extremely <Col N="62" /> limited. In addition, the implementation of any agreement, given the track record of unreliability and broken promises on the part of Belgrade, is something that will have to be carefully pursued and closely monitored. Nonetheless I hope that we will hear of positive results by the international negotiators in Belgrade.</P>
    <P>In regard to the continuing tragedy of the disappeared, I join in deploring the agony being visited upon the relatives of people who were murdered by the IRA. It has been a harrowing experience not only for the relatives but also for everyone closely involved with the Northern Ireland peace process. We have finally acknowledged the suffering of these people who for so long were ignored by everyone, not least by the republican movement. I welcome the fact that information has been passed on but I appeal to the IRA and anyone in possession of information to come forward with more explicit details in order that these people will be put out of their misery. It is time the republican movement lived up to its stated commitment to embrace democracy and justice. It is ironic that those who advocate justice and who frequently call for it are so slow to admit responsibility for these murders and apologise unequivocally not only for the delay but for the original crimes.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government decided to refuse to issue visas to the Yugoslav football team which was an important symbolic gesture in terms of the Government's commitment to human rights and its unequivocal stance in relation to these matters.</P>

      <P>My Department's worldwide website is not currently operational. The IT resources available to my Department have been directed in recent months towards critical projects such as the year 2000 issue. However, the Deputy will be aware of the launch in October last of the Heritage of Ireland website, the marketing website for my Department. This website promotes the national cultural institutions, the heritage sites managed by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department and the inland waterways from a tourism perspective. The Deputy will also be aware that this website has received widespread popular acclaim.</P>
      <P>A project to develop a single website for my Department as part of an overall IT strategy is due to commence shortly. The project will involve the identification of material for publication and the launch of a pilot site, the development of detailed website plans and procedures and the implementation of a fully managed website.</P>

      <P>The resources available to my Department have not allowed me to get this website operational. However, I advise the Deputy that it is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year. While it is still in its infancy, the Heritage of Ireland website has proved a popular and critical success. It received a best website runner up award at the Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association International awards last November and it has been featured by computer magazine, <i>PC Live</i>, as one of its top ten December sites. It also received several other nominations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might be interested to know that in the period from January to April 1999 the website received 32,628 visits and 350,543 web pages were requested. An IT strategy plan was produced recently by external consultants. We hope to have the website operational by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is totally unacceptable that the website will not be operational until the end of the year, given that many people will want to visit it not only to view the broadcasting legislation which was published recently but also to find out about the Government's proposals on broadcasting? It is ridiculous that the only proposals on the website are those which relate to the last Administration.</P>

      <P>Again, it is a question of priority. The Deputy is well aware of my anxiety to ensure that the Bill is published so that everybody is given an opportunity to examine it, a proper debate is held and it is passed through the House before the end of the year. Certainly, if I had a choice to have the website operational without publishing the broadcasting Bill or to publish the Bill and put the IT resources in place before the end of the year, I would prefer to publish the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware that there are only three people in the broadcasting section of my Department and our priority is to ensure that, rather than having Green Papers and clear focus papers, etc., on broadcasting, we publish broadcasting legislation. This is one of a number of Bills that have been published by my Department over the past two years and the broadcasting Bill is the priority. At the end of the year, there will also be a fully operational departmental website. I have set priorities which I believe to be correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that if all the material relating to the broadcasting Bill were available on the website, it would lead to a much more efficient and effective use of the resources currently in the Department? People could visit the website without having to write to or telephone the Department. It is incredible that the Department is not availing of information technology, which is in use throughout the public ser<Col N="66" /> vice and the country at large, for such major legislation.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the progress, if any, made in the past two months regarding the provision of a centre for performing arts at UCD; the meetings, if any, which have taken place in that period; the stage at which negotiations are regarding the UCD authorities vacating the premises at Earlsfort Terrace; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14735/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 3 of 29 April regarding the proposal to establish an academy of performing arts at the UCD property in Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2. I mentioned at that time that the interdepartmental working group set up by the Minister for Education and Science and myself had recommended in its interim report &ndash; copies of which were placed in the Oireachtas Library on 12 May &ndash; that further discussion was needed to identify the precise areas of specialised training required and indeed the precise model for an academy in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science and I have engaged the services of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London to conduct a study, the specific terms of reference for which are to report on the appropriate scope and content for the proposed academy for the performing arts in Ireland; the areas of immediate and longer term specialisation appropriate to the academy; the process to be adopted to achieve the preferred model and the potential, if any, for rationalisation of existing courses.</P>
      <P>The Guildhall has wide experience in the teaching and practice of the performing arts and will be able to bring an added outside perspective to the issues involved. In order to prepare its report the Guildhall is currently having discussions with a number of institutions and persons, many of whom took the time and trouble to make written submissions to the interdepartmental working group.</P>
      <P>We expect that the Guildhall study will be completed by the end of June and when completed the recommendations will be considered by our two Departments. Pending receipt of this study, it is not considered appropriate to address the question of the vacation of the UCD premises. In this connection we have received a separate preliminary feasibility study prepared on behalf of the Royal Irish Academy of Music, the Gaiety School of Acting, the College of Dance and Dublin City University on the establishment of an Irish Academy of Performing Arts that has been submitted recently to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Deputy will agree that it is vitally important that the scope and content of the proposed academy be discussed with interested pro<Col N="67" /> fessionals so that resources that are invested in the academy will be put to best use. The traditional models for an academy or conservatoire are being questioned and critically examined in the context of the multidisciplinary needs of those who wish to make worthwhile careers in the practice of the performing arts and also in the context of developments in modern technology.</P>
    <P>Contemporary thinking emphasises the need to ensure that such educational institutes are seen to be part of the communities in which they are located and are capable of reaching out to the wider educational community rather than being perceived as elitist specialist institutions. It is, therefore, critical to devise the right model and artistic mix to satisfy contemporary needs and this is the task in which we are engaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>My question refers to the past two months. What is the target date for completion of the centre for performing arts? What is its overall projected cost? What is the overall projected cost of the purchase from UCD of its Earlsfort Terrace property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for acknowledging that work has been done in terms of the studies which have been carried out since his last inquiry on this issue. Currently, we are looking at the content of courses for the performing arts. This, obviously, must be done in a systematic way. Given the fact that Ireland does not have such a centre, it is important to consult countries which have one. It is also important to note that the traditional models of an academy or conservatoire are being questioned and there are some critical views of this within a European context. It is essential that we establish the correct model here, which is most up to date and effective. We see it as being part of the community and not as an elitist or specialist institution.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, we are looking at the content of the courses and where they will be located and until those reports have been completed and reviewed, we will not be able to supply the costings which he requested. We hope to have the report from the Guildhall in June and the other report which I mentioned is already at hand. It will form part of the Guildhall's deliberations on the matter. We will then make our decisions on foot of that. At that stage, I will be able to supply further information to the Deputy on the costings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did some valuable work during the week on the National Inventory of Architectural and Historic Buildings. She reduced the period for its completion from 40 years to 12. I hope that the assessment of the models and the analyses of the criticisms in Europe will not drift for such a period.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Has UCD confirmed that it is willing to dispose of the property in Earlsfort Terrace for the centre for performing arts? If so, is it not better, assuming that the Government is intent on setting up the centre there, to discuss a price, given that property prices in Dublin have increased phenomenally over the past number of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>These matters are under discussion and, therefore, it is not appropriate to go into the costings. However, I assure the Deputy that there will be no delay on our part, nor has there been since the beginning. We hope to have the information correlated by June, particularly in regard to the models that might be involved. This will be announced as a millennium project.</P>

      <P>Dírím aird an Teachta ar an bhfreagra a thug mé ar Cheist Uimhir 20 den 29 Aibreán. Déanann Bord na Gaeilge pobalbhreitheanna go rialta i gcomhar le IMS ina gcuirtear ceisteanna mar gheall ar ghnéithe éagsúla den Ghaeilge sa sochaí. Faoi láthair tá staidéar ar siúl ag an mBord ar riachtanais thaighde na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh agus ó Dheas mar bhonn do chlár taighde oiriúnach a réiteach. Mar chuid den obair tá modhanna cuí á dtástáil chun meon an phobail i leith na Gaeilge a mheas &ndash; go háirithe i dTuaisceart Éireann.</P>
      <P>Foinse thábhachtach eolais faoi úsáid na Gaeilge is ea Daonáireamh na bliana 1996 inar cuireadh ceist don chéad uair maidir le cé chomh minic is a labhraíonn daoine Gaeilge. Ba chóir a lua freisin go ndéanann Institúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann suirbhé náisiúnta gach deichiú bliain agus gur foilsíodh an ceann is déanaí sa bhliain 1993. Tugann an taighde seo, National Survey on Languages, eolas mar gheall ar dhearcadh an phobail i leith na Gaeilge, ar a gcumas Gaeilge agus ar an úsáid a bhaintear as an nGaeilge i réimsí éagsúla.</P>

Tá taighde i gceist agam anseo a bheidh leathan, domhain agus cruinn. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an freagra a thug an t-Aire Stáit sásúil sa mhéid is nach bhfuil an pobalbhreith nó an daonra a luaigh sé leathan go leor chun an <Col N="69" /> scéal ar fud na tíre a mheas. Fáiltím roimh an pobalbhreith atá le cur i gcrích i dTuaisceart na tíre, ach níl go leor taighde déanta, agus gan an taighde sin, nach n-aontaíonn an t-Aire Stáit go gcaithfimid bheith amhrasach faoi na polasuithe atá á gcur i gcrích ag an Roinn agus Bord na Gaeilge?</P>

Tá a fhios againn freisin gur mhaith le thart ar 20 nó 30 faoin gcéad den phobal feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 269 of 16 June 1998 as well as Questions Nos. 232, 233 and 234 of 19 May 1999 when the position regarding the Unidroit Convention on the international return of stolen or illegally exported cultural objects was outlined. As I have stated, legislation is required before ratification can take place and I am currently considering the next steps in this process, having regard to the limited resources at my disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect the heads of that legislation to be available? Will it be in 1999 or sometime next year? Will she outline the monitoring process she has in her Department to prevent the illegal export of cultural objects? Have there been any seizures arising out of that monitoring process and is she happy that she has the resources at her disposal to prevent cultural objects from being stolen or exported illegally from Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to secure the proper protection of cultural objects in an international context. To do this it is necessary to show that there can be no hiding place in Ireland for cultural objects unlawfully removed or stolen from the State. This needs co-ordinated international action and there has been an international code of practice governing the contentious and emotive issue of restitution of important cultural objects to their country of origin. While the long-term effects of the convention will ultimately depend on the number of states which sign up to it, and some important countries are undecided on it, nonetheless it is pointing to a norm as the future of international law. Deputy Kenny is obviously concerned about the present position and it is important to point out that taking account of the protective measures already provided by way of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, and the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, accession to this convention would be an important building block in legislative terms in the protection of our movable cultural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlicensed removal and theft of cultural objects of national importance from the State has arisen from time to time in recent years. When <Col N="72" /> the need has arisen to effect the return of the object in question, the absence of a pragmatic, workable framework in the international arena has hampered the speedy conclusion of negotiations. However, it is important to point out that in such situations the State has relied on diplomatic channels to effect progress and progress has been made in a number of cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the legislation be brought forward in the year 2000? Have there been any preventions of cultural objects from been exported to date?</P>

      <P>Preliminary contact was made with the Attorney General's office and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a draft memorandum was prepared in the Department late in 1998. The Attorney General's office sent a further detailed reply to the Government's draft memorandum in February of this year which shows that complex issues must be teased out before detailed proposals could be brought to Government in the form of a memorandum. Given the limited resources at the disposal of the Department and against a backdrop of competing priorities &ndash; not least of which is the preparation of a national heritage plan, which includes movable heritage &ndash; it will be some time before a memorandum can be finalised.</P>
      <P>It will be possible to examine the question of the Unidroit Convention and the need for further protection of artefacts in the context of the national heritage plan.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the position in regard to Ireland's compliance with the EU habitats directive; the progress, if any, made in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The habitats directive requires member states to propose relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation and to protect their favourable conservation status. It also requires member states to transmit a list of the proposed areas together with full information on each site to the EU Commission within three years of the date of the notification of the directive, that is, by June 1995. The directive specifies scientific criteria for the selection of these areas which will form a network of sites known as Natura 2000.</P>
      <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94/97). The main part of Ireland's SAC network has, since March 1997, been publicly advertised for designation and receives legal protection in Ireland from that date.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission recognises that the viability of the Natura 2000 network of sites is dependent on the co-operation of the landowners and land users whose lands are included in the sites. I believe that all those whose lands have been proposed for SAC designation must be given an opportunity to object to the proposals, on scientific grounds, before I formally transmit the list to the Commission. To this end I have provided an opportunity to landowners and to land users to have their appeals examined informally by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. I have also established a board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, the former Ombudsman, and comprising of representation from the landowners and the conservation organisations to independently assess appeals and to advise me on these matters.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has been notified of our proposals in relation to SACs and the reasons for the failure to meet the deadline for transmission of the list of sites to the Commission. The Commission is also aware that, while Ireland is not in compliance with the directive, the advertised sites receive full protection under our national legislation.</P>
      <P>The current position is that 114 of the 207 publicised sites, covering more than 184,000 hectares, have now been transmitted to the EU Commission. I anticipate that the bulk of the remainder will be formally transmitted by the end of July this year. I also propose to publish proposed non-priority habitat type SACs by the end of July and for proposed marine sites to be published by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the directive is to benefit landowners and the general public. How <Col N="75" /> many departmental staff are employed on this? Has the number been increased to cope with the appeals system introduced by the Minister? Will the Minister outline the responsibilities of each of these staff members?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The details in my initial reply show that quite a large area will be referred to as SACs under the terms of the proposed directive. The Commission is aware that Ireland is adopting a special approach to this matter. We wish to comply with the directive while recognising the rights of landowners and land users, particularly with regard to appeals on scientific grounds.</P>
      <P>With regard to extra staff, I am sure the Deputy will agree that there is a greater need for rangers to monitor this work. The Minister of State and I endeavoured to have more rangers appointed and this has been done.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer the question. If she does not have the information on the number of staff involved in the designation of special areas of conservation, I would appreciate if she would send it to me. The Minister's predecessor expressed reservations about objections on scientific grounds. How many additional staff have been appointed following the expansion of the appeals system? Why is it that only 50 per cent of lands proposed for designation have been designated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>SACs have legal protection. The reason for the delay is that we wanted to put a proper and fair procedure in place. The former Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, has been appointed to chair the appeals committee. Forty one liaison committees have been established to date. Thirty seven meetings have been held at which committees have been formed. A further 19 meetings will be held shortly. Much work is being done by my officials, the Minister of State and me on this issue. There will be no difficulty in supplying the information sought by the Deputy.</P>

What does the Minister intend to do about this and the shortage of staff in her Department? How many new wildlife rangers will be employed?

      <P>The National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, confer on me the responsibility and powers to protect the State's national monuments, including the power to preserve, by way of a preservation order, archaeological sites or monuments which may be at risk of being damaged or destroyed, as well as the power to prosecute persons who contravene the provisions of the Acts. The National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, made provision for the protection of all heretofore documented archaeological sites and monuments, numbering some 120,000, in the State by establishing the statutory Record of Monuments and Places. There is a requirement that any person proposing to carry out works to a site that has been included in the Record of Monuments and Places must give me two months written notice of the proposed works. The Record of Monuments and Places, which was completed in December 1998, represents a significant milestone in the protection of the built heritage of the State. While the powers of protection afforded to me under the National Monuments Acts are considered to be sufficiently strong, the question of carrying out a systematic review of the existing legislation to ensure the continued protection of our archaeological heritage is being considered in the context of the national heritage plan which will be published next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the legislative powers available to me, there remains a problem with the continuing destruction of archaeological sites throughout the country. More often than not, this is done unwittingly but sometimes it occurs at the hands of unscrupulous developers. There is a need for better education and awareness which I <Col N="77" /> am constantly striving to achieve through various initiatives which include an annual newsletter to all primary schools in the country. I am also looking at means by which the wildlife ranger service could be extended to cover monitoring of archaeological sites. I see some scope in developing alliances with local authorities and other local interest groups whereby they could assist in keeping a watch over local archaeological sites and monuments. These are initiatives which I intend to explore further in the context of the national heritage plan.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister congratulated the archaeologist responsible for the prosecution of a farmer who was destroying an historic monument at Clonmacnois? It was the first case to be taken for a long time. I am delighted that there is somebody in the Department who is on the ball. I dread to think of all the monuments which are being destroyed by unscrupulous developers and landowners. Much of our heritage is being destroyed daily. What does the Minister propose to do about this? Does she have enough staff to ensure the 120,000 heritage sites are protected?</P>

      <P>It is important that the National Monuments Acts are reviewed from time to time. We will have an opportunity to do this in the context of a national heritage plan. Ireland is a party to the 1992 European convention on the protection of the archaelogical heritage, the UNESCO convention on the protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage, and the United Nations convention on the law of the sea which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that states have a duty to protect objects of an archaeological and historical nature found at sea. There is a requirement that any person proposing to carry out works to a site that has been included in the Record of Monuments and Places must give me two months written notice of the proposed works.

      <P>The Arts Council was established as an independent body in 1951 to stimulate public interest in and promote the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts. The functions of the council are set out in section 3 of the Arts Act, 1951, as amended by section 13(2) of the Arts Act, 1973. Annual funding is provided in Vote 41 of the Book of Estimates and subject to the approval of the Dáil. The Appropriation Account of the Vote is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>Under the Arts Acts the council is required to submit its accounts annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. The report and accounts of the council, with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas pursuant to the provisions of sections 6(3) and 7(1) of the Arts Act, 1951.

      <P>I recall from the Estimates debate at the Select Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language that £28 million is being allocated to the Arts Council this year. Since the accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts, does the Minister agree it would be in the interests of the arts, democracy, openness and accountability that the director and senior officers of the council should be asked to appear before the select committee to deal, not with the accounts <i>per se</i>, but with the broad policy direction the council is pursuing?</P>

      <P>Under the Arts Act, as the Deputy will know, the Arts Council has always been independent. That independence is very important if we are talking about true democracy. Obviously, it is important that Government funds the Arts Council in every way it can. It is then for the Arts Council to decide how and to whom that money is distributed. There has always been an arm's length principle regarding the workings of the Arts Council. It is important the council is accountable as regards how it spends that money in general terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I outlined in my initial reply, under the legislation and the procedures in place, there is a satisfactory way in which to account to the Oireachtas for the funds available to the council. It is important we continue with the arm's length principle. The work of the council has always been on the basis of this principle which ensures decisions on specific grants are made at a distance from the political process and remain indepen<Col N="79" /> dent from the day-to-day business of artists and organisations.</P>

However, I would not see any difficulty in principle or in a democratic sense if the director and senior officers of the Arts Council were asked to give the background on how general policy decisions are arrived at and how funding schemes were devised without getting into the business of individual applications, whether successful or not.</P>

      <P>The Arts Council has been putting a mechanism in place making general policy more transparent as well as the criteria on which particular grants are allocated to the different arts organisations. There are a number of booklets on how someone may apply for a grant and on the criteria laid down. There is openness in terms of how the Arts Council works. It is very important for the democratic process to ensure the Arts Council is independent in its day-to-day workings and that this arm's length principle continues. There is no need to amend existing legislation or introduce any further mechanisms to ensure the Arts Council is working in a fair way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I have received from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs an estimate of the number of island inhabitants in receipt of old age, retirement and widow's-widower's pensions. These figures are being examined in the context of the ongoing discussions between my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regarding the possible introduction of a special islander allowance.</P>
      <P>While I accept that this issue has been under consideration for some considerable time, it involves a number of broad policy issues that need careful consideration. As I stated in reply to a question on 29 April 1999 this is a budgetary issue. In this context, I will be pressing that a final decision on this matter one way or the other be made in the context of this year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the final sentence of the Minister's reply mean that there is no absolute commitment to an islander allowance? The Government's programme clearly makes a definite commitment to such an allowance. Does the phrase &ldquo;one way or the other&rdquo; mean it is possible that such an allowance will not be introduced?</P>
      <P>Can the Minister give the approximate numbers of inhabitants of offshore islands? There seems to be some confusion in this regard. Will D506&ndash;F</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> the Minister state the figures he has received from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in respect of those in receipt of social welfare payments of various types living on offshore islands?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment was given in a policy document which I wrote in opposition and which contained 28 points. I recently checked that document and the vast majority of issues raised in it are either being implemented or have been implemented. However, there are some major broad policy issues in relation to this issue which do not relate to the cost of introducing the allowance on the islands but relate to the possible precedent its introduction might create in relation to the rest of the country. Those issues are being discussed between the Departments. I am still keen on the concept, but valid points have been made in relation to the national effect. I make the case that people living on offshore islands are in a unique position and that the introduction of the allowance will not necessarily have a knock-on effect.</P>
      <P>I have figures in relation to the number of old age pensioners, etc. on our islands, but rather than going through them in detail it is possible for us to make them available to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I must stress that the issue is the ring fencing of the proposal and not the cost <i>per se</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that following discussions with the Departments agreement is reached that it should be introduced, will it apply to all offshore islands? The number of inhabitants on offshore islands according to the 1991 census was 9,564 while the figure in the 1996 census was 9,280, including four people who occupied the Skellig Rocks in Kerry according to the Central Statistics Office. Obviously, these four were archaeologists from the Minister's Department and I assume that while they are probably now back in Dublin they might retrospectively receive the islander allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office considers islands with bridges to the mainland when completing the census. Bull Island in Dublin, for example, is not considered an island for the purposes of the census, as are Leitir Mór, Leitir Mulláin, Valentia and Achill. What we have defined as islands, in terms of the operation of the Department, are those areas cut off by the sea everyday. Therefore, we consider as islands inter-tidal islands and islands such as the Aran Islands which are continuously surrounded by sea. In rough terms we are talking about a total island population of 3,000 people. Some of these people are working and some are not and a social welfare allowance will only apply to those in receipt of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Use of the term &ldquo;islander allowance&rdquo; seems to imply that it will be means tested. What is the maximum level of allowance envis<Col N="83" /> aged and what were the criteria applied in arriving at that figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>If introduced it would not be means tested as we spoke of an islander allowance in terms of a tax free allowance which is never means tested. In relation to social welfare the free fuel allowance, for example, is not necessarily means tested. As regards the level of allowance, figures were tossed around for the cost. However, cost has not been the main consideration.</P>
      <P>The objective of the allowance is quite clear. The case made for it is twofold, namely, that islanders pay tax on, for example, the bringing of food to islands because they pay tax on transport, and because it is generally recognised that living on an island is quite considerably more expensive, particularly in accessing basic services such as hospitals, etc. The allowance was proposed to allow for this extra cost. There are people who argue whether there is an extra cost, but most reasonable people who examine the situation will consider that there is. The allowance would not be very big but would be a recognition of the position of islanders.</P>
      <P>We will know we have tilted the balance too much when the island population begins to increase rapidly. Anybody who thinks island life is cheap or easy has not experienced it. There is a need to continually level the playing pitch and, as Minister of State, I have been doing my best in co-operation with my colleagues to achieve that aim of equality and parity of esteem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not means tested might it apply to the single resident of Inishvickillane?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Permanent residency will be an absolute requirement. For example, if it is not means tested a person in receipt of a contributory old age pension, which is not means tested, would be entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not mention the quite considerable costs which can arise in relation to education for those living on the islands. Will these costs be taken into consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>We are already making considerable progress in providing education on the islands, which is the most satisfactory way of dealing with the education problem, but also in making improvements in the remote area grant. Since my appointment as Minister of State, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, at my behest has abolished the means test for the remote area grant. We have also provided much improved facilities for transport home at weekends, etc. We are constantly reducing the cost of education to islanders by making it easier for them to access education and, in particular, by dealing with the transport costs associated with <Col N="84" /> education which tended to be what made education for islanders so expensive.</P>

      <P>The Women's History Project was funded by me to meet three main objectives: to survey and record sources relevant to the history of women in Ireland, to list these sources and to make the list available to the public through the provision of a CD-ROM and to publish historical documents relating to the history of women in Ireland.</P>
      <P>This project is proceeding under the supervision of the Irish Manuscripts Commission. With the aid of funding provided by my Department, the project staff have completed their survey of material relating to women in Irish history. They have to date visited over 300 repositories in Ireland, North and South. Approximately 100,000 data entries have been made from the material found. This database is currently being edited and will be converted to CD-ROM format with a view to being made available to the public later this year.</P>
      <P>The second strand of the project includes editing, annotating and preparing for publication the Drennan-McTier correspondence which is held in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland. This consists of about 1,400 letters, mainly between Martha McTier and her brother William Drennan, spanning the period 1776-1819. Volume one, covering the period 1776-93, was published in 1998 and volumes two and three will be published simultaneously later this year. The project will also publish other material relating to women.</P>
      <P>The project also involves the listing of material relating to women in the files of the Department of the Taoiseach, 1922-66, which are in the custody of the National Archives. There are approximately 1,400 boxes of material to be examined and it is expected that this work will be finalised by 2001. Once completed this database will be made available to researchers through the National Archives.</P>

      <P>I am committed to improving the standard of information available to the public at national monument sites throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I was concerned that for many years there had been an inconsistency in the approach to signage at properties managed by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. In order to address this situation and to help to ensure standardisation in the quality and design of information panels at Dúchas sites, Dúchas has just produced a sign system manual. This manual is now the corporate design manual for Dúchas signage throughout the country and will help to ensure that in coming years, there will be consistency in signage at Dúchas sites. The manual has been circulated to all Dúchas depots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue of improved information signage is also being addressed in a tangible way through a major signage programme currently in train at national monument sites. This extensive programme will continue for several years, and a list of the sites which will benefit under the current phase of the programme follows for the information of Deputies. The current phase of the programme, which concerns panels to be supplied in 1998-99, includes some 100 information panels which are scheduled to be delivered to the national monuments district depots from July 1999 onwards for distribution and erection at the individual sites. It will take several years, and <Col N="87" /> considerable costs and effort to complete this programme but I am fully committed to this course of action.</P>
    <P>There are two different types of information panel involved. The production cost, including research, text preparation, translations, illustrations, design, manufacture and supply, is £2,819 each for the larger type and £1,393 each for the smaller panel. The total contract price for the current phase of the programme is approximately £192,000, excluding VAT.</P>
    <P>In addition to my policy of improving information panels at national monument sites, I am also working with a number of local authorities to improve directional signs to Dúchas sites. The main example of such co-operation is with Clare County Council, which has agreed to provide more than 20 such signs in County Clare at my Department's expense. I am convinced that this investment will improve greatly the quality of the visitor experience to the Dúchas sites concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me raise this crucial matter on the adjournment. The presence in the House of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to reply to the debate shows the importance which he attaches to this proposal also.</P>
      <P>The proposal by the Commission to introduce an Irish quota of 14,000 tonnes of blue whiting is disgraceful and against our interests and will have disastrous consequences for the pelagic fishing industry, particularly in Donegal.</P>
      <P>Blue whiting is a relatively new pelagic species as far as the Irish fishing industry is concerned.   Prior to 1998, it hardly figured in our catches. However, in 1998 it is estimated that we caught approximately 35,000 tonnes and this year the estimated catch is in excess of 40,000 tonnes &ndash; a very significant contribution to the overall catch. While blue whiting is not as lucrative as other species, such as mackerel, horse mackerel and herring, it fills a crucial gap nevertheless in the pelagic fishing season and makes a critical contribution to the running and maintenance of the pelagic fleet.</P>
      <P>According to the Commission's proposals the total allowable catch for blue whiting, excluding Norway, is approximately 133,000 tonnes and we are being offered a derisory 14,000 tonnes or approximately 10 per cent. This is simply disgraceful, discriminatory and absolutely unacceptable. If implemented, it would be a severe body blow to the pelagic fishing industry, particularly in Killybegs and the Donegal area. It would deflate the economy of the region from the point of view of employment, income and the very viability of the fleet. We simply cannot allow that to happen.</P>
      <P>While we cannot control the total allowable catch for this species &ndash; that is primarily a matter for the marine scientists &ndash; we are certainly entitled to have a major say in how the quotas are allocated, bearing in mind that we are an island state and that such a high percentage of EU fishing waters come within our territorial area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criterion used on this occasion for allocating the quota is based on the so-called &ldquo;historical performance&rdquo; in the past five years. This is a loading of the dice against Irish interests and is <Col N="90" /> designed to accommodate the larger players such as the Dutch, the British and the Norwegians who are being given more than 80,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The historical performance method is discriminatory as the blue whiting did not figure in our industry until two years ago. When the horse mackerel quota was being allocated a different method was used, again to accommodate the larger players. The historical performance method would have been more favourable to us on that occasion but the fishing bullies of Europe made sure we could not avail of it. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. These proposals must be opposed most vehemently at the highest political level. We cannot afford another sell-out in fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must become involved in this matter because a vital national interest is at risk. The issue must be addressed at the leaders' summit in Cologne today. I understand from the Minister's contribution on the Order of Business that the issue may arise.</P>
    <P>Our first priority must be to have these daft and discriminatory proposals scuppered and abandoned. A fairer and more balanced method must be employed which will recognise our dependence on the fishing industry and the potentially important future role of the blue whiting species in the maintenance and development of the industry. Failure to do so will have disastrous consequences for the future of the pelagic fishing industry which plays such an important role in the economy of peripheral areas of County Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to brief the House on the up-to-date position in relation to the European Commission proposal to set quotas for the blue whiting fishery to the west of Ireland and Scotland. The Commission proposal was published last week and is scheduled for decision at next week's Fisheries Council. I have already outlined my opposition to the proposal which gives Ireland a quota of 14,343 tonnes, which represents less than 40 per cent of our average catches over the past three years. I wrote to the German Minister for Fisheries, in his capacity as President of the Fisheries Council, to inform him that the Commission proposal was unacceptable to Ireland and did not reflect recent track records in this fishery.</P>
      <P>The blue whiting fishery is vitally important for Donegal and the Killybegs fishing and processing industry. I briefed the Taoiseach on the Commission proposal and he immediately wrote to Chancellor Schröder to express Ireland's opposition to it. The Taoiseach also undertook to pursue the issue at the Cologne Summit last night and today. I had already requested an urgent meeting with the President of the Fisheries Council. The Taoiseach and I met members of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation yesterday to discuss the proposal and to inform them of our plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> The blue whiting fishery has, in recent years, become highly important for the larger vessels in the Killybegs fleet. The fleet began to actively fish blue whiting in 1996 and the average annual catches by the fleet over the past three years have been over 36,000 tonnes. If we included this year's catch, the figure would be even higher but it was agreed that this year's figures would be left out. Until now, the entire EU fleet has been fishing against a quota of 133,000 tonnes, of which 21,500 has been set aside for Spain and Portugal under their Acts of Accession. As this quota has been fully taken in recent years and the Commission has had to close the fishery, it is anxious that national quotas be established as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Council agreed at the December 1998 Council that the allocations should be based on recent catches prior to 1999. However, I do not accept that the methodology used by the Commission in coming up with the proposal that Ireland should get 10.78 per cent of the stock adequately reflects the Irish fleet's fishing patterns of recent years. Neither do I accept that the Council is legally obliged to give Spain and Portugal quotas equivalent to the flat rate entitlements which were allocated to them before a decision is taken at the Council on the allocation of the total 133,000 tonnes to member states.</P>
    <P>The other reality is that the European Union also grants entitlements to Norway to fish 245,000 tonnes of blue whiting in Community waters each <Col N="92" /> year, mainly off the north-west coast of Ireland and Scotland. Ireland alone has been objecting to this arrangement for a number of years and secured a commitment from the Council to reduce the quantity of blue whiting transferred to Norway in future years. I succeeded in having this quantity reduced by 10,000 tonnes last year and firmly believe that this arrangement with Norway must be re-examined in order to increase the quota of blue whiting available to the European fleet. I will be pursuing this issue when the annual negotiations with Norway commence later in the year.</P>
    <P>The permanent sharing of the EU blue whiting stock is too important an issue to be rushed through at the Fisheries Council on the basis of a last minute proposal produced in the final weeks of the caretaker Commission. We are pressing the German Presidency to have the issue taken back to the drawing board for the new Commission to come up with a more acceptable proposal which would give Ireland and other member states a fair allocation based on recent catches. We are confronted with the fact that all other member states, with the possible exception of UK, are quite happy to go with the proposal. Ireland is on its own on this issue which I regard as critical. I will be keeping in close contact with the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation in advance of the Council. I assure the Deputy that I am extremely serious about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 June 1999.</P>

      <P>The Irish Museum of Modern Art which is located in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, opened to the public in <Col N="94" /> 1991. Its remit is to provide the Irish public with access to the best Irish and international visual art through exhibition, collection and education programmes. The aim is to foster within society an awareness, understanding and participation in the visual arts through structures and programmes which are both innovative and inclusive. The museum employs some 70 people.</P>
      <P>The museum's estimated expenditure in 1999 will be £2.05 million. This compares with expenditure in past years of 1996 &ndash; £1.686 million, 1997  &ndash; £1.879 million and 1998 &ndash; £2.015 million. Grant aid payable from my Department's Vote for 1999 totals £1.754 million, &ndash; £1.550 million revenue and £204,000 capital-acquisitions for the collection. This compares with grant aid in past years of 1996 &ndash; £1.460 million, 1997 &ndash; £1.585 million and 1998 &ndash; £1.725 million. Almost £300,000 will be raised through events-conferences-donations and sponsorship the surplus from which goes towards programming and some staff costs.</P>
      <P>The attendance figure for 1998 was 350,000 and continues to rise, compared to 100,000 in 1991 when the museum opened.</P>
      <P>The museum provides a wide variety of collection, exhibition and education programmes which are supported by cost effective administration, communication, security, operations and financial management. The exhibitions are mediated by an award-winning education and community programme which includes talks, lectures, workshops, seminars and participatory programmes. The education and community programme also includes a series of projects specifically designed for those who are marginalised in society.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment the museum has acquired by purchase some 304 works and has secured long-term loans and donations of another 1,580 works from collections in Ireland and abroad. There are constant displays from the collection in half of the available gallery spaces in the museum. The museum also cares for the Madden-Arnholz Collection of masterprints and spaces will be prepared for their continuous display over the next year. Works from the collection are regularly dispersed to art centres, galleries, museums, heritage centres and libraries throughout the country in collaboration with a variety of organisations. Education and access programmes also accompany these exhibitions and projects.</P>
      <P>Future plans include the development of the whole site in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works and my Department. The artists' studio programme has already been established in the renovated coach houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deputy master's house is under restoration at present and in early 2000 will open as a series of new galleries which will be totally environmentally controlled allowing the Irish Museum of Modern Art to present masterpieces of modern <Col N="95" /> art including some borrowed from other collections. It will also facilitate the storage of some of the museum's own fragile works of art in a proper environmental context.</P>
    <P>The adjutant general's building is also under renovation and is envisaged to become an access centre. Here educational opportunities and orientation material for visitors to the whole site will be provided with a rich variety of historical and contemporary material.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the dedication and commitment of the chairman, the members of the board and the director and staff of the Irish Museum of Modern Art. They have achieved a very great deal at the museum in a comparatively short period and their high standards are a particular mark of excellence at this truly national institution.</P>

      <P>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, CITES, has been signed by Ireland but cannot be ratified under current wildlife legislation. I propose to include in the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill the necessary provisions to enable the State to formally ratify the convention and I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill shortly. The Deputy will be aware, however, that the convention is already directly implemented in this country under Council Regulation (EC) No. 338/97 of 9 December 1996 &ndash; on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating <Col N="96" /> trade therein &ndash; and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 939/97 of 26 May 1997, as amended. The National Parks and Wildlife Division of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, fulfils the functions of both management and scientific authorities for this country for the purposes of the convention.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> In 1997 at the 49th Meeting of the International Whaling Commission, IWC, Ireland put forward a package of proposals designed to stimulate discussion and promote consensus among the member countries of the IWC. That package proposed the completion of the revised management scheme, where quotas are justified under the RMS, these should be restricted to coastal areas only, whales taken under these quotas would be used for local consumption only, lethal scientific whaling should be phased out over a period, and regulations on whale watching should be prepared. The context in which the proposals were put forward was the continuing concern among many member states regarding the serious impasse reached within the IWC in relation to fundamental issues on whaling and the steady increase in the number of whales taken each year outside the control of the commission. Despite the moratorium on commercial whaling, Ireland noted that whaling was continuing to take place within the terms of the convention under objection to the moratorium or under Article VIII, scientific whaling. The trend in the number of whales taken, identified as being of concern then, has continued, with 383 whales being taken in 1992, 1,043 whales in 1997 and 1,114 in 1998.</P>
    <P>The proposals put forward by Ireland provide a basis for the resolution of the serious conflict of views within the commission and sought to stimulate a process of discussion and debate within the IWC. Ireland's objective has been and continues to be that of reaching consensus within the IWC on a package of measures for the control and regulation of whaling. These proposals were the subject of further discussion at the most recent IWC meeting held in Grenada in May. At that meeting all countries indicated a continuing willingness to engage in the process of discussion. I am also pleased to record that IUCN, the world conservation union, has welcomed the proposals made by Ireland. In particular, there was strong and encouraging support for this process from the middle ground countries who perceive the proposals put forward by Ireland as providing the basis for a resolution of the serious ongoing conflict between the pro and anti-whaling countries within the commission. It is this conflict which has led to the serious impasse within the commission and has the potential to damage the effectiveness of the IWC and its recent achievements in whale conservation. Resolution of the fundamental conflict within the IWC will not be easy and while countries have indicated a willingness to engage in the necessary process of discussion, the difficulties in achieving a consensus on a solution cannot be underestimated. Accordingly, it is not possible at this stage to place any time scale on the Irish or any other proposals which may be put forward to resolve the ongoing impasse.</P>
    <P>In my view, a strong and effective IWC represents the single most important element for the <Col N="98" /> conservation of whale species in the new millennium. To be strong and effective it must be representative and credible to all constituent countries irrespective of their strongly held views and opinions. This is the challenge facing the IWC and more importantly represents the challenge to member countries to ensure the ongoing conservation of whale species. Ireland will continue through the IWC to facilitate in whatever way possible the process of dialogue and compromise necessary to secure consensus on a package of measures to limit whaling so that the conservation status of any whale population is not compromised.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to arrange a meeting between my officials and representatives of the organisation, Voice of Irish Concern for the Environment, to discuss all aspects of this important conservation issue. I am aware of the proposals being put forward by Voice. These proposals while well intentioned and idealistic are not very practical as they appear to ignore the fact that we cannot unilaterally remove the rights of whaling countries under the convention without their consent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 53 of the Bill provides for the payment by me to the Independent Radio and Television Commission, to be renamed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, of £500,000 from the Exchequer in respect of capital grants to local and community radio stations. It will be the statutory responsibility of the commission to prepare a scheme providing for the payment by it of grants to local and community radio stations for the purposes of defraying capital expenditure incurred by the radio stations on transmission. The Bill provides specifically that in considering an application for funding the commission shall have regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, any difficulty the radio <Col N="99" /> station has experienced in providing a service in the area of its franchise.</P>

These platforms are satellite, cable, MMDS and terrestrial transmission. My function relates only to the creation of the digital terrestrial television, DTT, infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has decided that arrangements should be made for the introduction of DTT in Ireland at the earliest possible date. On Thursday 27 May 1999 I announced the publication of the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, which is intended to facilitate the introduction of digital terrestrial television, DTT, in Ireland. Enactment of this Bill is regarded as urgent in the legislative programme of the Government. A new entity is to be created which will be mandated to build and operate the DTT infrastructure. RTE will be a minority shareholder in this entity to which will be transferred RTE's existing transmission assets. A project management group, chaired by my <Col N="100" /> Department and including representatives of other Government Departments and of RTE, is overseeing the management of this project which is already under way.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Broadcasting Bill and the creation of the DTT infrastructure entity will place Ireland at the forefront of developments in this field in Europe.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 28, 32 and 40 of 29 April last and my reply to Question No. 232 on 11 May 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the <i>Asgard</i> restoration project has made an application for a licence, under the national monuments Acts, for the restoration of the vessel. In accordance with standard practice I sought the advice of the National Museum of Ireland on the application and this advice is awaited. I understand that to fully consider the application for a licence the National Museum requested additional information in January last from the applicants but the information sought has not yet been received. The question of the future treatment of the vessel under the national monuments Acts cannot be decided until such time as I receive the advice of the National Museum, and consequently, the question of location and cost is not being considered at this time. It would be inappropriate to comment further on this matter until this advice has been tendered and considered.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 1994, provision is made whereby local authorities may establish historic monuments advisory committees. However, the establishment of such committees is a matter for each individual local authority.</P>
      <P>In addition, detailed guidelines, entitled Strategic Policy Committees &ndash; Guidelines for Establishment and Operation, were issued to all relevant local authorities by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in late 1997. I understand that local authorities were advised to review their committee framework but that it is entirely a matter for each local authority to decide on the composition of its own committee framework. In this context, the Deputy will appreciate that the setting up of heritage committees under the jurisdiction of local authorities would not be a matter for me in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I should, however, draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that my Department is currently preparing a national heritage plan, which I will publish next year. That plan will examine in a comprehensive manner all aspects of our heritage, including the most advantageous arrangements for the identification and protection of our heritage at both national and local levels.</P>

      <P>In the published revised estimates for public services for 1999 a nominal amount of £1,000 has been provided under subhead C4, described as heritage fund, of my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>Each of the national collecting institutions under my aegis have their own acquisitions policies and annual acquisition budgets. Occasionally objects or collections of Irish provenance are offered for sale which one of the institutions under my aegis wishes to acquire in the national interest. Sometimes the likely cost of the acquisition can be beyond the normal purchasing budgets of the institution concerned. In previous years where such a case arose other areas of my Department's Vote have been scrutinised to see if any savings had arisen or were likely to arise which could be reallocated to assist the collecting institution. If savings are available then funds can be provided for the acquisition, subject to the agreement of the Department of Finance. These funds would then be transferred between subheads of my Department's Vote and channelled to the relevant institution.</P>
      <P>Each case of this nature is carefully examined on its merits depending on many factors. The most important of which is a professional assessment of the monetary value of the object or collection concerned. This will determine the maximum price that should be bid or offered for the object or collection. Other factors such as the intrinsic importance of the proposed acquisition to the institution involved in the context of its collecting policies are also taken into account before a decision is made to bid for the object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new subhead for the heritage fund has been put in place as a more formal funding mechanism. I am currently developing proposals for <Col N="104" /> this fund and I will be making an announcement on this later this year.</P>

      <P>I regard all of our architectural heritage as being of interest and of value to the economy. In May of last year, together with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I launched the package of proposals for the strengthening and protection of the architectural heritage. This package, which is being progressively implemented by both Departments, adopts a comprehensive approach to the protection of our architectural heritage in its many and varied forms rather than singling out individual aspects of that heritage. As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government last week launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings to be administered by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the Heritage Council maintains a register of heritage buildings at risk and has the power to provide grant assistance for the conservation of such buildings. The Deputy may note that although my Department funds the Heritage Council, which is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants. I was pleased, however, to be able to increase the funding to the Heritage Council from £4 million in 1998 to £5.08 million in the current year, an increase of 27 per cent.</P>

      <P>The identification and protection of wrecks off the Irish coast is a matter of concern for my Department. A unit within the national monuments and historic properties service of my Department was set up in 1997 to produce a paper survey of these wrecks, and this has now been completed. A resultant publication is at present being edited and should be available next year. To date more than 8,000 wrecks have been identified by the unit.</P>
      <P>The National Monuments Acts 1930-1994, provide measures to protect any particular wreck on account of its historical, archaeological or artistic importance. All dives on archaeological wrecks, being a wreck which is more than 100 years old, and on wrecks which have an underwater heritage order attached to them, are subject to licensing under the National Monuments Acts, and any alteration to or removal of artefacts from a wreck must be carried out under an excavation licence issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>General matters relating to salvage and wreck in the State are governed by the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, the administration of which rests primarily with my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Section 3(10) of the National Monument (Amendment) Act, 1994, empowers the Director of the National Museum of Ireland to request from the receiver of wrecks that a wreck which is an archaeological object or is removed from a restricted area, and where no claim of ownership has been established one year after it comes into the receiver's possession, to deliver the wreck to the director, or sell the wreck and deliver the proceeds, after payment of expenses, to the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The position is that prior to 1978 there was no provision for the payment of pensions by this Department to the widows and children of deceased soldiers. Such provision was first made in 1978 when a contributory pension scheme for those dependants was introduced. All soldiers serving at the time were afforded the opportunity of joining the new contributory scheme or of opting out of membership. Indeed, soldiers who failed to exercise any option were included as members, with only those who made a positive option in writing not to become members being excluded from membership.</P>
      <P>For those who had opted out of the contributory scheme in 1977-78, a second opportunity to make provision for their dependants was given in 1985. In addition to soldiers serving in 1985, this opportunity was made available to ex-soldiers who had retired on pension since 1 June 1977 and who had previously opted out of the scheme. In the case of pensioners, the required contributions to the scheme could have been met by way of either periodic contributions from pension or payment of a lump sum.</P>
      <P>As a serving soldier the husband of the person in question opted out of membership of the contributory scheme before its commencement in 1978 and did not avail of the opportunity to become a member in 1985 as a pensioner.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to retrospectively change the conditions of the scheme at this stage. In the circumstances, I regret the person in question is not eligible for a pension under the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the difficulties faced by widowed persons, and in particular widowed parents. It is therefore worth noting that widowed persons enjoy a more favourable tax regime than single persons. The taxation of widowed persons in the year of bereavement is at least as favourable as that of a married couple with the married allowance and double rate bands continuing, to apply. In the years following the year of bereavement widowed persons are entitled to a widowed person's allowance of £500, which is additional to the personal allowance of £4,200 at the standard rate, and the PAYE allowance of £1,000 at the standard rate. The widowed person's allowance was not standard rated in Budget 1999. In the case of widowed parents, they are entitled to the widowed person's allowance of £500 and they can also avail of the widowed parents allowance of £3,700, of which £2,650 remains allowable at the widowed person's marginal rate of tax. A widowed parent on PAYE is thus entitled to tax allowances amounting to £9,400, that is, the same <Col N="112" /> as a married couple with one earner, and £3,150 of this remains allowable at the widowed person's marginal rate of tax. The existing, widowed parent's allowance includes the increase of £1,050 at the standard rate which I introduced in Budget 1999 with effect from 6 April this year.</P>
      <P>In the years following the year of bereavement, a widowed person with dependent children is also entitled to a bereavement allowance. In the 1998 budget I extended the period of this allowance from three to five years and increased the allowance to £5,000 in year one, £4,000 in year two, £3,000 in year three, £2,000 in year four, £1,000 in year five and nil thereafter, with effect from 6 April, 1998.</P>
      <P>Where a widowed person has a mortgage outstanding there is a provision in the income tax code allowing a widowed person to claim relief in respect of allowable interest of up to £3,600. The comparable figure for a single person is £2,500. A person in receipt of the social welfare widow's pension is not liable to the health levy of 2 per cent on not only his pension but on her entire income.</P>
      <P>Widowed persons have, like other taxpayers, benefited from the general tax improvements introduced in the last two budgets, that is, the standard rate of the personal and PAYE allowances; the increase in the personal allowances of £1,300 single-widowed and £2,600 married; the increase in the widowed parent allowance of £1,300; the increase in the PAYE allowance of £200; the widening of the tax band by £4,100 single-widowed and £8,200 married and the 2 per cent reduction in both the standard and top income tax rates.</P>
      <P>With regard to the taxation of the child additions to the social welfare widow's pension, the Supreme Court judgment in the Neenan case of 13 May 1998, upheld the current practice that a widow is liable to income tax in respect of the weekly widow's contributory pension including the portion paid in respect of each qualifying child resident with her. It should be noted that the Supreme Court decision did not alter the current tax treatment of social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>With regard to the taxation of the widow's pension, including the widow's contributory pension, I should point out that it is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments are, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes, including the social welfare widow's pension and its child dependant additions. This means that the widow's pension is combined with any other income a person might have for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extend to which taxation arises in a given case, from having such pensions reckonable as income for tax purposes, depends essentially on the amount of other income the recipient has in <Col N="113" /> the same tax year. If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare pension, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. Special costs associated with an illness such as those mentioned in the Deputy's question would be taken into account when a person's medical card eligibility is being assessed.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charges. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for those who do not have a medical card and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing require<Col N="114" /> ment for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication. Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>With effect from July 1999 the drug payments scheme is being introduced which will replace the drug refund scheme and the drug cost subsidisation scheme. Under the drug payment scheme, a person or his or her dependants will not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances for use by that person or his or her dependants in that month.</P>

      <Col N="115" /> Precise information is not available on the number of cases of hepatitis C, which is not a separate disease for notification purposes.</P>
    <P>Control of infectious diseases is the statutory responsibility of health boards, which are required to make arrangements for the diagnosis and treatment of persons with such diseases in their functional area. A multi-institutional study into the prevalence of hepatitis B in the population is currently underway and the results of this survey will be beneficial in relation to prevention and control of this disease. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for health care personnel, certain patients and their family contacts, security and emergency services personnel who may be at high risk, and susceptible members of high-risk groups. There is no vaccine available against hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The total number of cases of HIV at 31 December 1998 is 1,986. The yearly HIV statistics for recent years is as follows:</P>

    <P>The figures listed indicate that the numbers of cases of HIV have increased in recent years. These statistics show that we cannot become complacent about HIV-AIDS and that there is still a need for increased education and awareness to prevent the spread of the disease. The health promotion unit of my Department engages in a number of education programmes as follows: mass media campaign; emphasis on condom usage through TV and radio campaigns as a means of preventing the spread of HIV; convenience advertising involving the placement of AIDS awareness messages in washroom/toilet areas of third level colleges, women's' health clinics, selected entertainment venues etc. where they are guaranteed to be viewed by patrons entering these areas; AIDS resource materials for second level schools; and publication of guidelines for effective HIV-AIDS education.</P>
    <P>The National AIDS Strategy Committee is undertaking a review of existing national policy on HIV-AIDS with a view to establishing an updated strategy to bring us into the millennium. One important area which will be addressed in this review is the issue of education and prevention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 26 May 1999, I formally launched the &ldquo;Directory of Services&rdquo; and a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Standards of Care&rdquo;, both of which have been produced by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland &ndash; NAMHI. The &ldquo;Standards of Care&rdquo; pamphlet acts as a guide to assist families and service providers to develop the standards of care necessary to enable people with a mental handicap/intellectual disability to participate, to the greatest possible extent, in the social, cultural, economic, and political life of their community.</P>
      <P>While there has quite rightly been a particular emphasis on the development of services to meet the needs of those awaiting placement in residential and day services, there is also a need to ensure that clients already in services receive an appropriate standard of care. It is also important that standards are monitored and reviewed, to ensure that they are maintained.</P>
      <P>My Department, the health boards and voluntary service providers are committed to the development of services in accordance with the principles underpinning the United Nations Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with a Disability. In addition there is a commitment to the principles of equity, quality of services and accountability, and the concept of health and social gain which underpin the health strategy as a whole.</P>
      <P>Service agreements, which are currently being developed between voluntary agencies providing services to persons with a mental handicap/ intellectual disability and the health boards, will set out clearly the responsibilities of both parties in the provision of services and the principles which underpin those agreements.</P>
      <P>The Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Mental Handicap recently undertook an initiative which examined processes and mechanisms used to assess and document quality measures. This process, which involved both my Department and NAMHI, resulted in the identification of a number of mechanisms which would assist service providers to measure quality standards within their services.</P>
      <P>My Department is also working to develop evaluation tools and mechanisms which will enable us to evaluate and monitor various aspects of the services, and in particular the outcome for clients availing of the services. This has already commenced in the area of residential care, through the research study which is currently being undertaken on behalf of my Department, by the Centre for Study of Developmental Disabilities. During the course of this year, we will be undertaking preparatory work with a view to commissioning research into the outcomes in day services.</P>

      <P>Regulations made under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, provide for the monitoring of fluoridated water supplies. The regulations provide that the fluorine content of the treated water shall be determined by a daily colorimetric test and distillation tests shall be carried out at intervals not exceeding four weeks. These monitoring programmes are the responsibility of the sanitary authorities acting as agents for the health boards.</P>
      <P>Distillation tests under these monitoring programmes are carried out in the regional public analyst laboratories. No difficulties are anticipated in maintaining these testing programmes in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>I have also been in touch with my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government concerning the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988. These regulations also specify a frequency for monitoring public water supplies for fluorine content. Responsibility for complying with these regulations is a matter for sanitary authorities.</P>
      <P>Results of monitoring undertaken by the sanitary authorities under the 1988 regulations are submitted by them to the Environmental Protection Agency. On the basis of this monitoring data the agency compiles and publishes yearly reports, the most recent of which covers the year 1997. This report, which was published on 30 March 1999 is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Computer Services Board and the Department of the Environment and Local Government have taken the necessary steps to ensure that sanitary authorities are aware of the potential year 2000 problems and have advised these authorities of what action needs to be taken to ensure that no serious difficulties will arise.</P>
      <P>Progress reports submitted to that Department indicate that, in general, remedial programmes are being implemented on schedule.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the importance of reducing waiting times in all specialties as much as possible. It is open to each consultant to review his or her waiting lists and to treat individual patients sooner, in light of changing clinical priorities.</P>
      <P>I have recently taken a range of significant initiatives to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times for public in-patients. These include the provision of £20 million for the treatment of patients on waiting lists. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the 1998 figure and is 2.5 times higher than the amount allocated by the previous Government for waiting lists in 1997; the provision of £9 million to services for older people. This will help to free up acute hospital beds, some of which are occupied at present by patients who cannot be accommodated in sub-acute or rehabilitation facilities; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services. This will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for those on waiting lists; the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list initiative should be operated in future.</P>
      <P>The policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999, outline revised and updated procedures in relation to improving the liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospital and general practitioners; ensuring a more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level through the appointment of an implementation group and a patient co-ordinator-bed manager in each hospital; improved management of out-patient waiting lists; and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list.</P>
      <P>The policy circular reiterates the targets of treating adults in target specialities within 12 months, and of treating children in target specialties within six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of ambulance services in the Cork area is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board. The question of having an ambulance based permanently in Cobh has been the subject of examination over a number of years. At present, ambulance cover for the Cobh area is provided by Midleton and secondly from Cork City. The number of ambulance calls and response times are monitored by the health board on an ongoing basis and they have informed me that there has been no appreciable change in either the volume of calls or response times in recent years.</P>
      <P>A review of emergency ambulance cover provided in the Southern Health Board region was adopted by the board in 1997. This report identified a number of areas where additional cover may be needed and that the additional cover would be developed and reviewed over a period of five years. The report also considered the case for basing an ambulance at Cobh and found that such a proposal was not justified, on the basis that the potential for improving the emergency cover to the eastern approaches to Cork city and Cobh was best served by an additional ambulance based at Midleton and operating in the Carrigtwohill area by day.</P>
      <P>Much progress is being made in the quality of service, training and crewing ambulance with professionally qualified emergency medical technicians. The upgrading of the Midleton service in December 1998, whereby the ambulance is crewed by two emergency medical technicians on duty by day rather than &ldquo;on-call&rdquo; is impacting favourably on the provision of emergency cover in the Cobh area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to once again acknowledge the work which families and carers of persons with a mental handicap undertake in caring for their relatives. I understand the frustration of families whose relatives are on waiting lists for services and the toll which both the caring and the waiting can take on their health.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, despite the many competing demands which are made on the resources available to my Department, I have consistently identified as one of my priorities the provision of the additional residential, respite and day services outlined in the document, Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &ndash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001. The assessment of need is based on information from the national intellectual disability database and the information on the services being provided and on current and future needs has enabled us to identify clearly, for the first time, the level of unmet need over a five year period and to plan to meet those needs.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 1998, over 500 new residential and 760 new day places were provided. I was pleased to be in a position to allocate additional revenue funding of £12 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for these services. The additional revenue funding of £18 million will provide approximately 320 new residential places, 80 new respite places and over 200 new day places. This funding will also enhance the health related support services for schoolgoing children with autism, continue the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements and provide additional specialist and other support services. This funding is in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000. The amount of £10 million capital funding is also being provided to support the new service developments in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of additional respite services is also vital if families are to be supported in caring for their relatives at home. In allocating the additional funding this year, I made specific pro<Col N="126" /> vision for the development of additional respite places and I intend to increase this provision further in 2000. The evidence of my commitment to these services is clearly demonstrated by the level of additional funding which I have provided since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children almost two years ago. The additional funding allocated in 1999 brings the overall amount of both capital and revenue funding made available by me to the services to £53 million in 1999, increasing to £59 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's query on the number of persons with a mental handicap residing at home, the 1996 annual report of the National Intellectual Disability Database Committee indicates the following:</P>

      <P>Article 38 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, assigns competence to road authorities, on a devolved basis, to restrict the parking of large vehicles in specified areas. The article provides that where a no parking sign, accompanied by an information plate containing the symbol of a large vehicle and indicating a specified unladen weight, is in place, a vehicle which exceeds that unladen weight cannot be parked; this restriction continues until a traffic sign is encountered indicating that the prohibition has ended. The application of this kind of restriction on an area or other basis is for individual road authorities to consider in the light of particular circumstances.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, or £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme is a means tested payment where the applicant may have household income of £15 per week or savings or investments of £8,000 in addition to the maximum rate of the appropriate Irish contributory pension and still qualify for the fuel allowance. The current income limit will be increased from £15 to £30 per week in addition to the maximum rate of the relevant contributory social welfare payment, with effect from the commencement of the next heating season in October 1999.</P>
      <P>Persons who had been in receipt of a fuel allowance under the urban fuel scheme prior to the rationalisation of the fuel schemes and the takeover by my Department of the national fuel scheme in 1988, but who failed to meet the qualifying conditions under the national fuel scheme, were allowed to retain their entitlement provided they continued to satisfy the conditions for the urban fuel scheme. These were known as &ldquo;saver cases&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The urban fuel scheme was operated by the local authorities and there was automatic entitlement for recipients of old age non-contributory pensions, blind pensions and widow's contributory and non-contributory pensions regardless of means, subject to the one per household rule, provided they resided in the functional area of the local authority or in a house provided by the local authority.</P>
      <P>The changeover date from the urban fuel scheme to the national fuel scheme was April 1988, the end of the 1987-88 heating season.</P>

      <P>St. Coleman's boys' national school already has access to a remedial teacher service on a shared basis.</P>
      <P>My priority at present is to ensure that all schools which currently have no remedial service will receive the service with effect from September 1999. Arrangements to put this extension of service in place are currently being made by my Department.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of St. Coleman's boys' national school, Macroom, will be fully considered in the event that additional resources become available to improve existing remedial services.</P>

      <P>Participation by VEC members on selection boards is a voluntary public service. Fees are not paid to VEC members for this or other VEC activities. All members of VEC selection boards are paid appropriate expenses at standard rates. In certain circumstances my Department has approved the payment of fees charged by specialist members of selection boards who are not members of the VEC and who are not in public sector employment.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the shortage of pre-school places for children with special educational needs on Dublin's north side; and if an official of his Department will be appointed to receive details of any child in need of placement in order that parents may be assisted and an accurate assessment of need built up.</Quest>

      <P>My attention has not been drawn specifically to a shortage of pre-school places for children with special educational needs on Dublin's northside.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I held a national forum for early childhood education. My objective in holding the forum was to allow all groups with an interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> The report on the outcome of the forum has now been received in my Department and is being considered as part of the preparation of a White Paper on early childhood education, which will set out the Government's proposals for future development of services in this area including services for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>In advance of the White Paper, I recently announced an allocation of £1.2 million for special initiatives on early education. My intention is that this funding will be focused in particular on the development of early education services for children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Details of any child in need of placement should be forwarded to the special education section of my Department where the necessary follow-up action will be taken.</P>
