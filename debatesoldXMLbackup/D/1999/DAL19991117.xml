    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 35, Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad</i>]  &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 34, Stamp Duties Consolidation Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 2, Comhairle Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in the United States giving lectures on the criminal justice system at a time when computerisation in the Garda Force cannot begin on time because of inadequate industrial relations between the Garda Síochána and the Minister's Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was discussed on the Adjournment debate last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was discussed and we did not receive answers. The Government just told us what the PULSE system is. We were not told whether the system would work and whether the <Col N="2" /> people for whom it should operate would operate it. This is a failure of industrial relations and another example of the indecisiveness and come day, go day approach of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Government intend introduce legislation to amend Article 28.4 of the Constitution specifically to alter the provisions for collective responsibility to enable the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deny responsibility for actions that other Members of Cabinet might take?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If proposals are not being put forward, will the Taoiseach, as the <i>primus inter pares</i> of the Government, ensure that the Government speaks with one voice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Taoiseach the issue of accountability. I note that the Attorney General has been speaking on company law. He was also at the launch of the national plan. Effectively, he is becoming involved in pol<Col N="3" /> icy matters, which is his prerogative. However, if he becomes involved in policy matters, he should be accountable to the House. Has the Taoiseach a view on how to make the Attorney General accountable to the House in areas other than quasi legal areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House. Is the Taoiseach willing to take questions on the Attorney General's views during Taoiseach's Question Time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The person to whom Deputy Noonan refers is quoted in today's newspaper as making a statement to the effect that the Government is considering setting up a special division of the High Court to fast track disputes in respect of planning applications and infrastructural development. On that point, does the Government intend to introduce legislation to facilitate such a separate division of the High Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is under consideration. It is one of a number of matters being considered by the Government on how to speed up the infrastructural projects announced in the national plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My specific question to the Taoiseach is, does the Government intend to bring forward legislation and why did the Attorney General speak about the matter if it is not his responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the article in this morning's newspaper and it was correct to state that the Government is considering the matter. I did <Col N="4" /> not see a reference to any statement, announcement or consideration by the Attorney General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Taoiseach, I believe it inherently unsatisfactory that the Attorney General should express policy opinion on matters where he is the confidential legal adviser to the Government and that it would be in the best interests of coherent Government if the Attorney General forbore from making comments on policy issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter cannot be pursued at this stage. A final reply from the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General seems to be running the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that the Attorney General has not interfered or made policy decisions. As a former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton will be aware that it is common practice for the Attorney General to make lengthy statements on various issues. The present Attorney General has done nothing more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals which was laid before this House last week contains serious allegations and statements on the manner in which patients have been treated. Will the Government make time available before the Christmas recess for a debate on that report in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was on the Order Paper laid before the House. I am entitled to a reply from the Taoiseach on whether there will be a debate on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of Deputies wish to raise questions on the Order of Business and they cannot be accommodated if the Deputy continues to obstruct the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, this report was on the Order Paper of this House. Given that the report was laid before the House, it is reasonable that I should ask the Taoiseach if time will be made available by the Government to debate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask his question and resume his seat to allow the question to be answered because there are far too many offering. Does the Taoiseach wish to comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a series of reports on the Order Paper. It is a matter for the Whips to decide which one to bring forward. They do so irregularly because of the amount of business before the House. That can be debated if there is agreement, but it is a matter for the Whips to decide in regard to any such reports and there are several of them on the Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three questions for the Taoiseach. When is it intended to introduce the Wildlife Bill? Will it be before or after Christmas? When is it intended to give legal effect to an independent auditing board for the National Museum and the Botanic Gardens where there are only caretaker visitor boards at present? Will the Taoiseach confirm that section 20 of the Western Development Commission Act, 1998, has been deleted because the fund has not been seen since?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. Similar legislation was introduced in 1927 and its replacement is long overdue. In the interim, a great deal of money, effort and resources have been invested in the education system, evidence of which can be seen in the arrival of the so-called Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>It is important for any country to spend its available resources on education. However, as in other areas, one can end up with the kind of two-way traffic flow which exists at primary level in the education system. The Minister must recognise that a high percentage of people cannot read or write when they reach 14 years of age. He may say that this is not his responsibility because the root of the problem lies in the past. However, that was not the approach taken by the Taoiseach on the Order of Business when Deputy Bruton inquired about upcoming legislation. The Taoiseach immediately recalled the events of 1988 but I have no need to remind anyone about how vague can be the Taoiseach's memory of other matters relating to that era.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister for Education and Science to face up to this responsibilities. He holds office at a time when the percentage of people who cannot read is higher than ever before. That is the reality. Thanks to his good PR machine &ndash; he is no different from his colleagues in Government to whom PR is very important&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear Deputy Smith's comment. The Government spends its time with its spin doctors and the Minister for Education and Science is no different. In the age of the soundbite, it is important for him to be seen announcing the introduction of this, that and the other. If the Minister concentrates on reducing the numbers of people who cannot move, he will have done his Department a great favour.</P>
      <P>I will refer to a number of issues. When Keenagh national school, County Longford, was built, a general purpose room or outside shelter was not provided. At that time, the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, stated that there was a lack of resources and that construction had to proceed in a slimmed down form. As a result, Keenagh national school has no general purpose room or outside shelter and I ask the Minister to address this matter immediately. It is unbelievable that children are obliged, in all kinds of weather, to spend their lunch break outside in an open yard. I ask the Minister to ensure that the school is provided with a general purpose room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter I will raise, which is very important, involves provision of a speech and lan<Col N="13" /> guage unit in Longford. This is a pressing issue, in respect of which I have received representations from parents and other concerned parties. It is like bouncing a ball between the Minister's Department and the Department of Health and Children. Nothing has been done. I have tabled questions to the Minister for Education and Science and to the Minister for Health and Children. The Minister for Education and Science told me it was a matter for the Midland Health Board; the Department of Health and Children said it is up to the Department of Education and Science. I say to the Minister across the floor of this House&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with educational disadvantage. There are people under 14 years of age with special educational needs in County Longford. I was elected by the people of Longford-Roscommon to point out their needs at any given opportunity and that is what I am doing today. I am saying, through the Chair, to the Minister for Education and Science that a speech and language unit should be put in place in Longford at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with school absenteeism. That is an area which has not been dealt with in years. Some of the Cavan and Meath Deputies will recall the garda coming to school with someone on the bar of their bicycle. I remember well a garda arriving at the school with one student on the bar of the bike and another on the carrier. Those were the days when the gardaí went out and brought people into schools. That time has gone.</P>
      <P>At the same time, there are people who, for one reason or another, do not even attend primary school. They have left the system at ten years of age. Statistics have proven that those who opt out of education at an early age are those who appear in the crime statistics later in life. That is the reality. The State has to pay then for their time in prison and their court cases. The Minister now has the opportunity to deal with this. With the money available to the Government to spend over the next seven years, which goes up by the second, the Minister has the opportunity to do something that no Minister has done in years &ndash;  he must concentrate on this area and ensure that everyone up to 14 years of age gets a start in education. If they opt out at that stage they are gone. Even in the midlands the number of young people who opt out of education is remarkable. Education is important for the individual, the community and the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Johnny Brady. I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation. I commend the Minister on bringing forward once again legislation which will be of great benefit for the education system. I also congratulate him on the major improvements he has made to all areas of education, He has outlined a major programme of school building at all levels, the introduction of supports for children with special needs, funding for a literacy programme and improvements across the whole education spectrum. I congratulate him for targetting in particular children from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special needs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton referred to the need to improve the educational psychology service. I ask the Minister to speed up the provision of a national educational psychology service. In my county there is a need for a proper service. It is not lack of funding which hampers the establishment of such a service, however, but the difficulties in recruiting suitable personnel.</P>
      <P>There is an inaccurate perception that the school system is only interested in winners. We must encourage success but that does not mean that we should not care for the needs of all students. Education does not occur in a vacuum. Pupils come from home and may bring their problems to class with them, if they come to class at all. Traditionally the assessment of the stresses affecting pupils was left up to teachers, who were often compelled to fulfil a host of tasks in addition to being educators. Experience alerted them to potential problems, especially in non-attendance, but there was little they could do, even if they had the time. In cities and large towns, there were school attendance committees but elsewhere, as Deputy Belton pointed out, it was left to the local gardaí. There was no opportunity to intervene early. It was only when truancy became a problem that anything could be done. Sometimes this would mean the threat of court action against the parents. The teachers and gardaí acted with great humanity in all cases but were helpless to do anything else.</P>
      <P>Through this legislation, schools will be able to utilise an educational welfare officer who will be able to identify potential problems before they develop. The school welfare officer's activities will be co-ordinated by the educational welfare board which will have the resources and power to carry out its own research into the causes of truancy. The educational welfare officer's job will be to assist parents and pupils so the children will derive the maximum benefit from participating in the education system. The work of the board will support the work of the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Truancy exists throughout Ireland. Sadly it can be the beginning of a life of petty crime. This legislation aims to provide an understanding approach to the problem. This Government is firm in its belief that the proper place for young people is in school. The traditional sanctions for non-attendance will still be applied to pupils who <Col N="15" /> are not bothered to attend school and, more importantly, to their parents.</P>
    <P>There are some parents who prefer to educate their children at home or outside the established educational structures. This may be because of religious beliefs, the disability of the child or a belief that they can provide a better standard of education at home. This legislation respects those parents' actions as long as it can be proved that the children are receiving a level of instruction commensurate with that they would receive in a conventional classroom.</P>
    <P>The raising of the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16 is welcome. It is regrettable that so many people still leave school so early. We have a comprehensive system of education which provides opportunities for a wide range of interests and abilities. Those who leave early miss the chance to benefit fully from those opportunities.</P>
    <P>These young people are being lured away by the prospect of employment. For many 16 and 17 year olds, there is a great deal of peer pressure to leave school, where they believe nothing but failure awaits them. In many families there is no tradition of staying at school. The world of work is the ultimate goal for these children, just as it was for their parents. They do not feel they are adults until they start earning their keep, even in low income employment. The jobs for which these teenagers leave school are usually badly paid, with long hours and few prospects in areas older people with better qualifications would consider untouchable. However, people who leave school aged 16 or 17 should not be condemned to a life on low pay without prospects. In future, they will be told that they have choices.</P>
    <P>The Bill is progressive. In the past the care of the education system only extended to those in school. Once pupils had reached the minimum school leaving age and wanted to leave, they were on their own. The Bill foresees a registration system where early school leavers can remain in contact with education even after they leave school. Those who register will receive information about how to maximise their abilities and the options for continuing education that are open to them.</P>
    <P>The Bill also sets itself the challenge of ensuring that every pupil receives a certain minimum education. In the past this concentration on a basic education was understandable. The world seemed to be an unchanging place and as long as one could read, write and count, one was considered as having just the necessary amount of learning. However, the problem with this approach is that the world is changing quickly and will continue to transform itself beyond recognition. The advent of computers in the classroom means that many seven and eight year olds have skills beyond those of their parents. The concept of a minimum education is almost impossible to define and the Government and the Minister have quite rightly not attempted to enshrine it in legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> The legislation derives from a belief that all the nation's children are entitled to the best and most suitable education that can be provided. We must take care of them equally thereby giving our young people the best chance in life. There exists no better mechanism for ensuring our future prosperity as a nation than looking after the well-being of those upon whom it depends. I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputies Brady and Cooper-Flynn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. This legislation is proof of the Government's commitment to support education and our young people. Ireland's current prosperity is in no small part due to the fact that it has a young, well educated population. There is a clear link between education and prosperity but we cannot be complacent. Consideration must be given to those who drop out of the system and do not receive as full an education as they need or want. The Government has asked why this is happening and what can be done to help and this far seeing legislation provides many answers.</P>
      <P>One of the most progressive and pragmatic elements of the Bill is the establishment of a national educational welfare council which will co-ordinate the various aspects of the welfare of our students. We are fortunate to have a marvellous education system, staffed by dedicated teachers who have given years of service. They have often been left to cope with problems as they arise. One of the greatest of these continues to be non-attendance. Truancy has always been a problem. Many of us during our school years did not want to be in classrooms on a bright, sunny day but we resisted mad urges not to go school. Some young people were caught between the need for education and their parent's need to use every available pair of hands on the farm during certain times of the agricultural year.</P>
      <P>Truancy often occurred when there was illness in the family. It is prevalent in modern day Ireland but it is most common in deprived areas. However, truancy only ensures that deprivation will continue in the future. Education continues to be the best passport to a better tomorrow. The approach to truancy in the past has been to penalise the parents of those who did not attend school. The job of inspecting school attendance was handled by special school attendance committees in cities and large towns and by the Garda in smaller towns and rural areas. These people did an excellent job as they dealt humanely and sympathetically with difficult cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, they did not have the back-up to deal with the causes of the problem and it is better to try to tackle the cause than to deal with the symptoms each time they appear. It is a sad reflection of modern life that the Garda has more pressing issues to deal with. We have a duty to establish the problems which lead to non-attendance. Teachers are aware of some reasons behind individual non-attendance cases but they lack the <Col N="17" /> time, training and, most importantly, resources to do anything about it. That is where the social welfare officers to be appointed following the enactment of this legislation will play a new and valuable role in the education system. Their activities will be co-ordinated by the national educational welfare council. The legislation aims to help and understand. However, youngsters who prefer to roam the streets rather than obtain an education and, most importantly, the parents who cannot be bothered to ensure that they attend school will be penalised.</P>
    <P>A small number of children do not attend regular schools and sometimes they have valid reasons. Their parents may feel that they are able to provide a better level of education at home. While all of us may not agree with an approach that isolates children from each other, their parent's wishes must be respected. It must also be ensured that the education they receive equals that in conventional schools. The national educational welfare council will ensure that this takes place. It will also put in place a system where teachers who operate outside the education system must be registered.</P>
    <P>Another problem facing the system is the number of pupils who leave aged 16 or 17 or even younger. They are often enticed by the prospect of low paid employment with poor conditions, prospects and often little protection against injury. It is easy to understand why some people opt out. The pressure on young people to contribute financially in families where both parents are unemployed is great. Young people also get an ego boost when they are working for themselves with the sense that they have become adults.</P>
    <P>The media does not help by glorifying the achievements of some successful people who left school early. We are always glad when people succeed but few pupils leave school early without any formal qualifications and then become millionaires. Most are employed in badly paid jobs for the rest of their lives if they are lucky. The Minister is anxious to curb early school leaving through persuasion. The school leaving age has been raised to 16 years. It is unfortunate than many 16 and 17 year olds will still leave because their place is at school. In the past those who left were forgotten about and nothing could be done but that will change as a result of this legislation. Early school leavers can still stay in contact with the education system through registration. This will provide them with continued assistance and information on the education options open to them. This is a valuable and pragmatic aspect of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are committed to providing all the nation's children with the necessary education to allow them to make meaningful contributions to society but the scope of necessary education is changing continuously. The days are gone when education consisted of providing ability in the three &ldquo;Rs&rdquo;&ndash; reading, writing and arithmetic. This may have done many of us good but the world will go on changing. Few <Col N="18" /> people over the age of 30 received any computer training but children aged eight or nine take this knowledge for granted, as do employers.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest aspects of education is developing the ability to learn from life. This legislation will ensure that no one will leave school without having gained this ability. Every student will know that he or she is valued. We must ensure the well-being of all our students for it is upon them that the future well-being of the nation depends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the consultation process which was undertaken to ensure that the Bill is informed and represented the views of all those who have an interest in education. This Bill has two focuses, which I welcome, to provide a minimum education for our children while recognising the duties and responsibilities of parents, the State and the child and to do so in a balanced way. We all recognise the importance of education and a child's need for a proper education to prevent social and economic disadvantage in the years ahead. It is clear from many of the studies, particularly the ESRI study, that in 94% of households which are experiencing serious disadvantage the head of that household was an early school leaver. That is why I welcome the whole focus and thrust of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue which is addressed is school attendance. There is a strong link between poor school attendance and social and economic disadvantage. Unfortunately, in Ireland today, 10,000 children leave school each year without any qualification whatsoever. People are no longer prepared to tolerate this and there is no need for it. In a booming economy it is important to encourage everybody to ensure our young people receive a minimum education and spend as much time as possible within the school system. For that reason I welcome the decision to raise the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16 years or the completion of three years post primary education. It is also important to have a co-ordinated policy throughout the country. In Cork, Dublin, Waterford and Dún Laoghaire the enforcing authorities for children who are not attending school are the corporations or county councils. In County Mayo the enforcing authority is the Garda. I am not happy with the idea of gardaí coming into schools and having to deal with this problem. I welcome the Minister's decision to set up the National Educational Welfare Board which will have a co-ordinated policy throughout the country. An important feature of that board is that it will appoint education welfare officers for each school, or group of schools, to enforce this legislation. I welcome also that the Bill allows the National Educational Welfare Board to lodge appeals, particularly where parents for one reason or another are not doing so, where a child has been expelled or, for some reason, is not obtaining a minimum education. I mentioned earlier the importance of balance and <Col N="19" /> I recognise the responsibility of parents. If a parent is not fulfilling that role, the State has a responsibility to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which allows for the exchange of data. Where children leave school early it is important they are not forgotten about and that there is a system in place to monitor their performance and what they do in years ahead. The exchange of data concerns schools, FÁS, CERT, traveller training centres, Youthreach centres, the Education Research Centre and the ESRI. It is important that young people, particularly early school leavers, are given every chance in the education area to ensure they get proper jobs and are relieved from social and economic disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the consultation process engaged in prior to bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Deputy Cooper-Flynn referred to the exchange of data. This is important because of the emphasis on the number of points one obtains in their leaving certificate. If we look at that class five or ten years down the road, the number of points obtained do not necessarily bear any reflection on how successful they have been or what they have achieved. It is important to realise that because it may show some students, who may not be academically gifted, they may succeed in areas where others may fail in the future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, the general aim of which is to ensure that children of a compulsory school going age attend school and, if not, that they receive at least a minimum education. The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill seeks to address the underlying causes of truancy and to identify at an early age children who are at risk of developing school attendance problems. The Bill goes on to impose statutory duties on schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland we have always had the perception that our education system in one of the best in the world. The National Development Plan 2000-2006, published on Monday last, points out that a comparison of inter-country data on outcomes suggest that Ireland's education system has produced consistently good outcomes. However, it goes on to say that a great deal remains to be achieved if economic and social policy objectives are to be met. The plan refers to the link between economic growth and education, stating that the rate of investment in education and training has been identified as one of the primary contributors to our economic development and that investment in education and training has a very high rate of return and accounts for a significant proportion of the observed variation in economic growth rates around the world. The plan refers to labour force flexibility and labour force availability. Accordingly, under the plan, investment in education will be concentrated on prevention of early school leaving, increasing the retention <Col N="20" /> rate at second level, expanding adult and second chance education and training opportunities, widening access to third level education and supporting the requirements of the labour market, among other measures outlined in page 95 of the plan.</P>
    <P>Research has shown that low education achievement increases the risk of becoming unemployed, entering into long-term unemployment and eventually dropping out of the labour force. On the education system, on which we pride ourselves, 25% of people have literacy problems. We bemoan our labour shortages and seek to fill the gap with asylum seekers, yet there are 200,000 unemployed. This is one of the great imponderables in the present economic boom. We say we have full employment and yet 200,000 are unemployed. Why is this so? These people have been failed by the education system because it did not identify what was amiss and what needed to be done. In decades gone by, this figure was smaller by 40% or 50% because a certain section of these people were employed as farm labourers or in labour intensive heavy industry. Due to economic changes these are no longer required as work practices have changed. We have 200,000 people who do not have the skills, confidence or knowledge to break out of the cycle yet they have the ability. Despite our advances as a society, I have yet to see any concrete measures to address this terrible injustice. The problem will not be solved by butter vouchers or the modern day eviction type notices that tell the FÁS worker his time is up, to get a job or produce evidence to show he was seeking a job. What is needed is a radical rethink of the education policy.</P>
    <P>Over 10,000 teenagers leave the education system each year without any qualifications. In his contribution, the Minister of State told us the Government has launched a number of policy initiatives in this area over the past two years, including the extension of the home-school liaison service to every school classified as disadvantaged, special education needs which have been targeted through the introduction of a needs based system of supports, the extension of the remedial teaching service to every school in the country and the establishment of a new national educational psychological service which is already under way.</P>
    <P>Many primary teachers, despite having no formal training, can identify that some of their students have some difficulty, be it in the area of application or an inability to grasp certain aspects of instruction but, despite this recognition, many are not aware of what corrective steps could be taken in an endeavour to address the problem. For those who do, they will generally seek to make an appointment for the child with an educational psychologist who has been assigned to their area. Having discussed the matter with the child's parents there is general satisfaction that the problem may be solved. Later a response is received indicating it will be 12 months before the child can be attended to. Further inquiries show <Col N="21" /> that a private appointment can be availed of within four to five weeks. In some cases the family can afford the charge and go privately, in other cases the school may take up the fee but in many cases nothing happens. This child will almost certainly go on to become one of the 10,000 early school leavers before becoming a member of the 200,000 persons on the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, life is not necessarily fair and there are few opportunities to address the equality problem. However, this is surely one area where the absence of equality can be overcome by an adequate provision of the required service. I do not intend to be over critical of the Minister. He is only a couple of years in office, many faults have arisen over the decades and successive Governments have fallen down in this area. The main difference today is that funding is available, but this is no insurance against the final result. Throwing money at a problem does not necessarily result in a solution.</P>
    <P>This is especially true with regard to remedial teaching difficulties. The Minister was under pressure in recent years to provide a remedial service to all schools and this may have deflected from the overall plan. All children today have access to a remedial service. The Government believes it has addressed the clamour for remedial services, but unfortunately this is far from the case. The service was initially required for those 25% of people with literacy problems, but it is now required for those 10,000 who will become part of the 200,000 to whom I referred earlier. Virtually all children who need the service receive minimal attention in tuition. One teacher may have to cover up to five schools in a round trip of 40 miles. To date, the service is only scratching the surface. There is a shortage of teaching resources. In this context how short-sighted was the decision to close Carysfort College?</P>
    <P>If student teachers received proper instruction during their training on how to teach young children how to read we would not have such a requirement for remedial services. Perhaps my good friend, Senator O'Toole, might disagree, but I believe many remedial teachers may not be using the best methods. This is not necessarily their fault as the Department of Education and Science has failed to establish a coherent policy on reading. At what age should children be taught to read and what method of instruction should be used? The Minister may give an apparently acceptable answer, but the reality is that there is not a standard practice, and not alone does practice vary from school to school but from classroom to classroom. We try to teach our children to read at too young an age.</P>
    <P>In almost all cases teachers do not have the required expertise to recognise dyslexia. I have encountered many families who have spent years in desperation as they tried to establish why their child, who they knew to be clever and intelligent, did not like school and wanted to opt out. It was caused by embarrassment about not being able to <Col N="22" /> read and the resulting effort of trying to hide this kept the child away from school.</P>
    <P>Recent research at a juvenile delinquent centre in Britain found that 50% of offenders suffered from dyslexia as opposed to approximately 5% of the general public, although the latest research indicates that the percentage figure among the public has increased to 8%. I have tabled parliamentary questions this week to ascertain if the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children are aware of this research. In an era when our prison system is causing much difficulty surely we need to carry out similar research here. If we do I am confident the results will show that a very large proportion of offenders will have the symptoms associated with dyslexia. Ultimately, this complaint will have been the catalyst to throw these people into a world of exclusion and crime as they felt removed from mainstream society and sought to strike back at a system that had failed them.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to initiate such research here, not because the money is available or out of a prurient interest, but because, ultimately, it may save many people from the dark side of life and make our new and quasi-modern society better. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this aspect and I hope the Minister will look at it. I realise it is difficult for him to get on with the day-to-day running of his Department without undertaking research in other areas.</P>
    <P>Tied in with this aspect of teacher training is the concept of in-service training. Some teachers can teach for 40 years and not attend a training day. They may use outdated and outmoded methods. The Minister referred to the launch of the revised primary curriculum. How can he assure us that all teachers will attend the necessary in-service training organised for this school year and, more importantly, how will he address the absence of teachers on maternity leave or career breaks? Can he assure the House that these teachers will have the opportunity to avail of instruction at a later date?</P>
    <P>The concept of in-service training must be developed. Every profession is involved in it. Industry spends much money on research and development and invests heavily in training. However, the education system draws a virtual blank in this respect. The Minister launched a highly publicised campaign on the computer project for primary schools, yet many computers are untouched and the only concern of teachers is that they are not stolen. What is the point in giving the computers to some schools when none of the teachers can operate them and no system of teacher training has been put in place to instruct them on their use?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The creation of a proper in-service training system, which at a rough estimate should entail five or six months every five or six years, would require a radical investment in the provision of teacher training places. The effort to overcome this impasse is welcome, but it needs to be more structured to address the needs that will arise.</P>
      <P>In all such areas of public sector employment, we must re-examine our policy of recruitment, as a far greater proportion of people will now leave for the private sector than was the case heretofore. This, and the desirability of making available a more comprehensive service, must have a major impact on our recruitment policy. It is a sad fact that in every aspect of life the &lsquo;eat, drink and be merry' theory takes such an over-riding precedence that we often face unnecessary suffering in the future due to a lack of planning in the past. I was strongly reminded of this earlier today as I sat in traffic on the Rathgar Road as part of a two hour journey that just two years ago would have taken one hour. Traffic is always heaviest when schools are open.</P>
      <P>The journey gave me the opportunity to see the many private schools and colleges that have been established to cater for those who are dissatisfied with the public system provided by the Minister. There appears to be a proliferation of Cole's notes schools. In my day the use of Cole's notes was the handy way of studying<i> King Lear</i> or <i>The Tempest</i> if one did not have time to study the play in its entirety. Such schools are exclusively geared to obtaining for students a certain level of points.</P>
      <P>The right of parents to educate their children in the home environment is enshrined in Article 42 of the Constitution and I hope the Bill will not encroach on this right. The Minister refers to a required minimum of education. Section 14(1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the <Col N="24" /> National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and such other persons (if any) as the Minister considers appropriate, prescribe a minimum education to be provided to each child.</P>
    <P>This is a very important provision. Given its central position in the Bill, it would be better if, in the interest of clarity, the Minister provided an operable definition of the term &ldquo;minimum education&rdquo;, even if it is to be subjected to change in the future. Perhaps he will do this on Committee Stage. Much reservation and apprehension has been expressed by those who have chosen to educate their children in the home. I hope the Minister is seeking to address these concerns when the Minister of State referred to the continued and intensive process of consultation with the partners in education by him and officials of the Department. I welcome his statement that these consultations have proved immensely useful and have informed a number of amendments he will table on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Last night I attended the meeting of a board of management in County Wicklow. One of the items on the agenda was called &ldquo;Student Report&rdquo;. It briefly outlined the case history of a problematic student in her early teens who had been suspended and whose case had been passed to the social welfare officer. Members of the committee were disturbed to discover that little or no support was available to her in the education field. I hope the new National Educational Welfare Board will be able to assist this student. I appreciate it is a difficult area and I hope the structures which will be devised will be operable and attractive to such students. It is an area which will have to be closely monitored and the success or otherwise of the Bill will ultimately be judged on how the board approaches and handles such matters.</P>
    <P>One hopes the provisions of the Bill will be implemented in a more thorough manner than those of the School Attendance Act, 1926. Much of this depends on funding, support and the follow-up monitoring system which is put in place. The Bill also places certain responsibilities on boards of management and the necessary expertise and guidance should be made available to ensure these can be carried out in an effective manner. Many people on boards of management are apprehensive in the current climate that they may go beyond their prescribed duties. It is important, therefore, that an exact field of responsibility is outlined for them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a few general points. I realise my good colleague, Deputy Belton, has used all the Minister's budget with his requirements for Longford but, if anything is left, I would like the Minister's officials to take note of the points I raise. The first relates to income levels for higher education grants. Many people, especially PAYE workers, are excluded from these schemes, although in my view such people are the new poor. The income levels should be raised. There are many delays in the administration of these schemes. While I realise this is the responsibility <Col N="25" /> of local authorities in many respects, perhaps the Minister could examine the possibility of his Department paying colleges directly.</P>
    <P>Regarding league tables, I disagree slightly with my party spokesperson on education. All things being equal, perhaps they should not be published because the information may be misused. However, it is important to note that when I attended NUI Galway, then UCG, individual students' results were placed on the noticeboard but were previous to that published in <i>The Connacht Tribune</i>, which is unusual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. It was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an exact date for junior certificate results as many parents tried to organise functions for the night in question last year only for him to pull a fast one by bringing the release date forward by a day? This forced many parents to cancel their arrangements, but it did not stop the shenanigans. Other areas of which the Minister should take note include the disabled and education. This is a difficult area which I am sure he is trying to address. I understand bullying in school may in future replace Army deafness where many cases for compensation will be taken. I received that information from some of my sources in the legal field.</P>
      <P>Regarding facilities in County Wicklow, the PE hall in Scoil Chonghlais in Baltinglass is at the tender stage. Perhaps the Minister could do something about it as we are under great pressure in that regard. The same applies to the PE hall in Arklow. This should be borne in mind because physical education is being included in the curriculum. Scoil Bhríd in Carnew has made a submission for additional facilities which the Minister might bear in mind. The parish priest heading the project for the primary school in Lackan passed away recently. The project is at a loose end and I would appreciate if the Minister could address it. Finally, I am sure the next time my good constituents in Grangecon visit Cork, the Minister will welcome them with a cup of tea and the provision of the extra teacher they seek.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before examining the specific provisions in this Bill, I will make a few general comments about national education policies in Ireland. One of the reasons a high level of inward investment is secured from third countries, especially America, is due to the confidence foreign investors have in the educational and training standards of our young people. Those in the <Col N="26" /> workplace with good qualifications are fortunate, having come through an exacting education system. It is fair to say that consecutive Governments since the 1960s have all worked towards improving educational opportunity. By the year 2004, Ireland will be the fifth wealthiest country in Europe. This does not arise as matter of coincidence. The large sums of money invested in primary, secondary and third level education programmes contribute to the ever greater spiral of job opportunity and job placements.</P>
      <P>However, we must recognise that, notwithstanding the strong performance of the economy in recent years, our new-found wealth has not filtered through to all sectors of the economy. No nation can be proud of itself unless it can guarantee assistance to the less well off and disadvantaged within its respective communities. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government recognises this fact and, moreover, the need for comprehensive moneys to be put aside to combat many of the key social problems in our society. These include the problem of adult literacy as well as combating unemployment in many urban and rural blackspots.</P>
      <P>Many of our social problems derive from the explicit link to educational disadvantage and a lack of job opportunity. Investing in education and in people is the key way a Government can ensure people can accept a job in society with dignity and self-confidence. It has been well documented that people without the most basic of educational training qualifications have difficulties carrying out their affairs in life compared to others who have better education and training skills. This is certainly the case when one looks to the problem of adult literacy which is a hidden problem in our society. Education and training work best when they are lifelong experiences. It is always important, however, for people to get off to a good start. It is more difficult to have to catch up with others in later life if one has been unfortunate enough to have fallen through the education net, whether due to slow learning, truancy or other related matters.</P>
      <P>This imbalance needs to be rectified by every child being guaranteed a minimum standard of education. The facts speak for themselves in terms of the links between poor education and marginalisation. ESRI research has shown that 94% of households in poverty are headed by an early school leaver, of whom 75% have no qualification, while a further 19% are headed by a person who has completed only one junior cycle of education. Intervening in this cycle of disadvantage, in the view of the Government, requires a strategic investment to stem the flow of the minimally qualified and unqualified young school leavers into the labour force, allied with a strengthening of second chance education options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is why the Government has brought forward the Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999, which is designed to redress many of these issues. The Bill has come about after extensive discussions with the partners in education. It is always better that <Col N="27" /> changes in an important field such as education come about as a result of consultation and discussion and not by an approach-based means or coercion. I commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, on the fact that widespread discussion and consultation has taken place with regard to the important provisions presented in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been drafted to address the needs of those most at risk from suffering educational disadvantage. At present, the main statutory basis for compulsory school attendance is the School Attendance Act, 1926. No significant amendment has been made to this Act in the years since its enactment. The general aim of the Bill is to provide a comprehensive national system to ensure children of compulsory schoolgoing age attend school, or if they do not attend school, that they at least receive a minimum standard of education.</P>
    <P>The Bill shifts the focus of school attendance enforcement from criminal sanctions to addressing some of the underlying causes of truancy, helping children and their families and identifying, at an early stage, children who may be at risk of developing school attendance problems. The Bill imposes statutory duties on schools to adopt a more positive approach to the issue of truancy and provides a mechanism for the co-ordination of the activities of various publicly funded agencies with regard to school attendance matters. Under the existing legislation the school leaving age is 15 years. Under this Bill, this is to be raised to 16 years or the completion of three years post-primary education, whichever is the later. The statutory duty imposed on parents to send their children to a recognised school is also retained.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a legal basis for bodies specified by the Minister for Education and Science to gather information and to exchange data between them on children who leave school early. The purpose of this provision is to put in place an effective tracking system to ensure children can be identified and a record kept of their subsequent involvement with the education and training system in the interests of helping these children achieve their maximum potential. This Bill will ensure that young people under the age of 18 years who leave school early are identified. The parties concerned include schools, FÁS, CERT, traveller training centres, youth centres, the Education Research Centre and the ESRI. Every year, more than 10,000 teenagers leave the education system without any qualifications.</P>
    <P>It is important that the National Educational Psychological Service continues to be well funded. The Government has also launched the Stay in School initiative which aims to keep pupils in school until their leaving certificate at a minimum. These programmes will also complement the existing leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programmes as well as the junior certificate programme.</P>
    <P>The Bill must take account of the Minister's duty to ensure all children receive a minimum <Col N="28" /> education. A national educational welfare board will be set up which will provide a supportive framework to assist schools with implementing the provisions of this Bill. There will be a statutory obligation on the board to make an education available to children of compulsory school-going age to whom an education is not otherwise available. This latter provision gives a statutory expression to the constitutional duty of the State to ensure children receive a certain minimum education.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the national educational welfare board may act in the place of the parents by lodging an appeal against a refusal to enrol or to an expulsion. In addition, the board may make submissions to an appeals committee where a parent has lodged an appeal. For children who have left school and who are under 18 years of age, the national educational welfare board will assist them to access continuing education and training.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Bill will result in excessive reporting of trivial school attendance problems to educational welfare officers. This is not so. In the majority of instances, schools will deal with the problem of non-attendance at local level. This Bill is not intended to deal with the child who misses three or four days over the course of the school year which could quite conceivably occur in the case of many pupils. However, the Bill must make provision for the Minister for Education and Science and the Government to fulfil their duty to ensure every child's right to a minimum education is vindicated.</P>
    <P>I will turn to the issue of the role of educational welfare officers within the structures of the new regime. It is the intention of the Government to ensure educational welfare officers continue to act in a positive and supportive role to children and to schools. The particular roles the educational welfare officers will play under the aegis of the new national educational welfare board will include the assessment of the education provided to children educated outside the mainstream school system and assisting schools in tracking students who stop attending one school but fail to register in another one.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill which are premised on the need to ensure all children are given a real opportunity to secure a minimum level of education. The Bill updates legislation on this subject which is decades old and ensures the Government will take substantially more practical measures to comply with its legislative and moral obligations to provide education to all the children of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the departure from the traditional approach in this Bill, particularly in regard to the provision of a supportive infrastructure to ensure a better level of school attendance. The Bill sets out children's right to minimum education with great clarity and acknowledges the rights of parents to choose. Many of us have <Col N="29" /> received correspondence on the latter issue, about which some people have expressed concern. The Bill also clearly outlines the State's role in providing an education service.</P>
      <P>The major departure in this Bill lies in the provision of a structure to encourage students to attend school until leaving certificate level or its equivalent. Heretofore, the constitutional position set out the broad principles and, of necessity, a fine balance was struck between the rights and duties of children, parents and the State. However, that balance has not always been clear. Any legislation in this area must reflect the constitutional provision and must respect the balance between the rights and duties of children, parents and teachers. The central consideration must always be children's rights and the opportunities presented to individual children. This Bill goes a long way towards that. It has not attracted a great deal of attention in the manner which the Education Bill might, but it is extremely important in practical terms.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies referred to the ESRI reports which identify the close correlation between early school leaving and levels of poverty. Many people will have been shocked to learn that as many as 10,000 pupils per annum leave the education system without qualifications. That is entirely unacceptable and there is a need for intervention such as that provided for in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had the pleasure of providing more, in terms of support to education, than any of his predecessors who set out the theoretical position on what was required and desirable. However, nobody has been in the position to make provision in regard to remedial, resource and special needs teachers, the development of the National Educational Psychological Service and the huge departures in curriculum development which we have witnessed in recent years and which represent the culmination of five or six years' work over the course of recent Governments. The Minister has made an enormous and positive contribution to education in terms of the provision of resources, which are always a central consideration of those involved in education. I know the Minister is somewhat disappointed that school principals believe his efforts to date have not addressed the level of resources available to them. I am sure he is tired of me pursuing this issue with him. The INTO will commence a further phase in its campaign on this matter either today or tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a school principal for 20 years. The fact that 80% of school principals are engaged in full-time teaching duties militates strongly against the quality of education which can be provided. It undermines the morale, not just of the principals themselves, but also of their schools. It is past time the matter was addressed. The Minister has forcefully stated that, more than any other provisions he has made, this matter has implications for resources. I am satisfied the issue is being addressed but perhaps it needs to be addressed <Col N="30" /> with a level of urgency which has not been brought to bear heretofore.</P>
    <P>I do not recall ever having seen a school attendance officer during my 20 years in teaching. It is a long time since I trained as a teacher and I must confess to being relatively ignorant of the 1926 Act. I learned some information, which I had either forgotten or never known, in the course of this debate. The 1926 Act had become defunct for most practitioners in education. There were not any support structures in place and there was not a realisation that the support structures which existed should have been adhered to.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the transfer of pupils between schools and the enrolment of students who come from outside the State. The Bill is somewhat weak in this regard. It is very difficult to put in place a watertight system which ensures this is adequately deal with. I suspect that, in the current climate, the way in which it is dealt with in the Bill perhaps needs to be strengthened. I do not know how the Minister can do that but it is something which needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>When I mentioned the various provisions in terms of resources and supports to schools, I forgot to mention the employee assistance scheme as it applies to teachers. It is a pilot scheme in a number of areas and the feedback I have received from teachers in those areas is extremely positive. It is a service which has enormous potential and I would like it developed more than it has been and its role within what is proposed here set out very clearly and centrally.</P>
    <P>There is considerable interdependence within a school system and between schools and, unfortunately, teachers, in general, and principals, in particular, do not have access to the level of support from their peers which would greatly benefit them. That is one of the main weaknesses in the system. It is perhaps the key factor which will undermine the effectiveness of this Bill.</P>
    <P>For a many reasons, the State needs to look at an effective and adequate system for monitoring the location of children. I was present at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government the other day when officials from local government set out the difficulties in locating voters and the reasons the electoral register was quite inaccurate in particular areas. It struck me at the time that if it is that difficult to know where adults are in built up areas, huge apartment blocks or even in remote rural areas, how much more difficult it must be to know whereabouts children of school going age. The system in some European countries is straightforward and there is a link between various elements, including social welfare and so on, and there is a tracking system.</P>
    <P>In the context of the revelations about child abuse, we need to look carefully at a similar system. Five, six or seven years ago, I would have been strongly opposed to it in terms of considerations of people's personal freedom but the more I have looked at it and the appalling experiences <Col N="31" /> of children, the more I believe it is not adequate to pay lip service and that we must ensure a tracking system is in place, which we are effectively demanding of the officers we appoint under this Bill. However, in some instances, we are making impossible demands.</P>
    <P>Even our support structures for teachers who suspect child abuse as a result of direct disclosure from the child, third party information, which may or may not be reliable, direct observation, observation of suspicious injuries over time or even aspects of the child's behaviour &ndash; I am talking about children attending school &ndash;  are totally inadequate. Perhaps we should have gone much further in this Bill to ensure the difficulties, which afflict a small number of pupils but which have a huge impact on them in their most vulnerable years, should be more centrally addressed in this Bill or elsewhere. The remit of the National Educational Welfare Board should be extended beyond what is set out in this Bill to include a much more central role in supporting teachers, perhaps with the services I mentioned, in a way which is not laid out in the Bill and in a way which would be hugely beneficial.</P>
    <P>There is some concern that parents who take their children on their annual holiday to the sun in January, September or whenever it is possible to do so may be targeted by the provisions of this Bill. The Minister's counterpart in the UK got into hot water about that issue. I strongly oppose that type of approach. In the 20 years I was a school principal parents told me they could only take their family holiday during school time for various reasons. I always encouraged them to go because I believed the value of the holiday in many respects far outweighed whatever gems of knowledge I would have been in a position to impart to them during that week or ten days. I have found a very right-wing opposing view to that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of educational welfare officers, although I would be concerned about their qualifications. I understand the legislation may not be the appropriate place to deal with that. This Bill can have a very positive impact and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing this Bill on the eve of a strike in the north-west where I understand principals in Mayo, Donegal and Sligo will go on strike tomorrow to highlight their plight in terms of the huge administrative tasks and burdens which are being placed on them by the bureaucracy in Marlborough Street. We are discussing this Bill in that context &ndash; a context of increasing frustration among principals and which Deputy Killeen so well articulated in his contribution. Increasingly, principals do not have the time to do their job because Bills such as this are producing more responsibilities and form filling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that there is no need for accountability within all aspects of education but sometimes we in this House &ndash;<Col N="32" /> there is also a tendency among Ministers &ndash; believe the only way we can sort out a problem is to ask a principal, a board of management or other partners to come up with strategies to solve it. We have built this type of mania into our legislation over the past ten years &ndash; that the best way to sort out a problem is to ask the board of management or principals to come up with a strategy.</P>
    <P>What is required in this instance to deal with the issues of truancy and early school leaving &ndash; they are not the same issue, they are quite different &ndash; are resources. In that context, this Bill is a disappointment. The Government promised the Bill over two and a half years ago. If the Government was serious about the problem of early school leavers, which I will discuss in respect of my constituency in a few minutes, this Bill would have been before the House last year or in the first six months of this Government's term of office but it went further down the list of priorities.</P>
    <P>I want to be fair to the Minister. I have read his contributions and remarks since the Bill was published in the latter part of the summer, but I do not believe this is a great advance in dealing with the issue of children dropping out of school which is only a small number that can be readily identified in certain parts of the city and country. This comes from a Minister who, as Opposition spokesperson, was completely opposed to the introduction of boards such as this. One must remember his contribution to the education Bill in which the then Minister, Ms Bhreathnach, proposed to introduce regional boards. The Minister was opposed to this regionalised board structure because he felt that if the money was available for the establishment of such boards, it could be put to better use in other areas. He may well have been right but when it comes to dealing with the problem of school attendance and early school leavers, he adopts the same approach &ndash; we should set up a board, give it a lump sum and ask it to do the job we should do ourselves because we have not had the wherewithal over the past 70 years to amend the legislation. Let us be clear. Prescribing new responsibilities to a board will not solve the problem, which is that we have 40 school attendance officers in four local authority areas, Dublin Corporation, Dún LaoghaireRathdown, Waterford and Cork city. There is a structure in those four areas and those 40 school attendance officers are doing a marvellous job. However, there is no structure in the vast majority of areas to deal with children who regularly do not attend school. In my constituency there is a laughable situation where gardaí are running around housing estates trying to pinpoint children who are not attending school. Those gardaí have other things to do with their time and, although they have a responsibility in this matter, they are not going to put the time into it. As a result, children are habitually missing school.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill about additional resources for school attendance officers, who will <Col N="33" /> now come under the control of the new board. There is no commitment in the Bill to additional funding for this area and that is why I am sceptical of the conclusions offered by the Minister in his Second Stage contribution. As other speakers have said, we are talking about 900 children who are not making the transition from primary to secondary school. That is an indictment of our society and of the checks and balances in our education system. That number is not huge in the context of the school going population, but it is still unacceptably high. In this city we are talking about 1,600 children every day who are not attending school. Those areas where the problem is most pronounced are the disadvantaged areas all Members know about. In those disadvantaged areas 20% of children do not attend school on a regular basis. As I said earlier, we have the ridiculous situation of 40 school attendance officers trying to deal with the problem on a national basis when we do not have one such officer in my constituency, where this is a real problem, because we are not in the Dublin Corporation area. The new county areas of Dublin, where this problem is most acute, have no school attendance system in place and there is no response from the State. That is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I do not like using the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; as it is rather Victorian and does not reflect the experience of those involved. This Bill is full of material one would expect from a PhD or MA in education, but it is not practical for many education providers, particularly those in my constituency and that must be addressed. The Minister accepted many Committee Stage amendments in the Seanad and I hope that on Committee Stage here he will be open to more. We are talking about children who are the products of an education system that has failed them. These are children whose parents have a very negative attitude to education and who have had poor educational experiences themselves. They had poor educational opportunities and do not relate to schools. These children are at most risk but there is no logistical provision in this Bill which will dramatically change the situation on the ground for those families. As I said earlier, the Minister was opposed to more layers of bureaucracy when he objected to the education Bill while in Opposition. However, he now seems to have accepted a bureaucratic system in this Bill, though it will not make a huge difference to children in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Children are not attending school for a variety of reasons and we must tackle that problem. One of the best examples of dealing with the problem in deprived areas is the partnership approach. There is an excellent project in my constituency, the STAY project in the St. Aengus area, which is trying to nip truancy in the bud by offering alternatives to children. There is a notion in education that children should be in class all the time, when a variety of models must be put in place to keep children's attention and to keep school and the curriculum relevant. The STAY project <Col N="34" /> employs many extracurricular activities to keep children interested in school. There are regular group work sessions, outdoor pursuits and homework support two nights a week. Children are also given after hours tuition and support with their homework and there is an incentive built in for every week they attend. Computer skills, sports, woodwork and arts and crafts are also used. The kind of innovative work being done by the STAY project and countless other groups is the kind of model we need to adapt for the mainstream. There is no recognition of this kind of partnership approach in the Bill, though it is the only kind of intervention occurring now, and we will have to revisit this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There will have to be a greater emphasis not just on the responsibilities of parents but on the responsibilities of schools to parents. Some of the best primary schools are now involving parents in the work of the school. However, a parents' room should be a prerequisite for any new school. Parents, particularly those in deprived areas who may see the school as alien to them, should have a place in the school. Parents come into many schools in my constituency for coffee with the staff and are encouraged to take their place in the school. Parents are very involved in a school reading week in another school in my constituency. Other community leaders, such as gardaí and politicians, are encouraged to get involved in the reading week also.</P>
    <P>These novel approaches encourage children to stay in school and try to ensure that the education system is more responsive, but they are not mentioned in the Bill. The Minister sets up a board, gives it a lump of money and tells it to go off and do its work. That is not good enough. We will have to tease out many problems with the Bill on Committee Stage. No pilot scheme is mentioned and the Minister should address this. The four areas &ndash; Cork city, Waterford, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Dublin city &ndash; have a structure in place to deal with school attendance problems, but I wish to refer to a speech given by the Minister on 21 September 1999. He was addressing a seminar he had established to deal with this matter and said:</P>
    <P>It is my intention, ultimately, to extend the system of school welfare officers nationwide. While I appreciate that this objective may take some time to achieve, officials of my Department have already begun to plan for the development and expansion of the service.</P>
    <P>Does that mean those outside the four areas I mentioned will have to wait until this new scheme is put in place? Will the schools in my constituency with attendance problems have to wait, like other parts of the country, until the new system is up and running and the board and the 40 school attendance officers have been appointed? Will we have to wait another two years for the publication of this Bill? Once again we are seeing the Minister's inertia on this issue. The Minister also stated that the development of welfare officers <Col N="35" /> should be a matter for the board. In one respect, the Minister is claiming to give all this responsibility to the board while at the same time he wants to be central to the decision making process. Whose responsibility is this? We need to clarify the responsibilities of the board and the Minister.</P>
    <P>We all recognise society's complete failure to encourage people to remain in education. There is no system in place whereby one can leave education and resume it in five or ten years, particularly as regards adult education. I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, about the provision of additional moneys for adult education in the development plan. However, there is no culture of easy movement in and out of education, as is the case in other EU countries where people acquire knowledge, work in industry and then return to education.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problem of school hopping which is particularly evident in September and October when parents, for whatever reason, take their children, lock, stock and barrel, out of a school, do not have another school to send them to and then complain to politicians that no other school wants to take them. I welcome the section which deals with that problem. Parents have a responsibility to ensure that before they remove their children from a school they secure a place for them in another one. There is a certain amount of educational snobbery, particularly in the larger urban areas, whereby parents feel their children are not getting a fair crack of the whip if they are not performing and consequently think they have a right to take their children from the learning environment in which they have been for a period of time and move them to another school. As someone who was involved in education for a short period, I am opposed to that. It is important to highlight this problem and I welcome the section in the Bill which deals with it.</P>
    <P>As regards the composition of the board, the Minister must select from the unions, the parents' representatives and the trustees. The partners in education are not referred to in terms of new board members, which is a major deficiency in the Bill. I do not want this board to be another board of hacks established by this House, the composition of which is changed every three or five years at the Minister's discretion. To ensure better balance, a section mentioning all the partners should be included in the Bill stating that two members will be taken from each category. As I understand it, the Minister has sole discretion in choosing board members, which will not please the partners. This issue was discussed in the Seanad and I hope the Minister has had time to reflect on it. He should concede to the categorisation of board members similar to that in the legislation dealing with An Bord Pleanála and which needs to be in place if the Minister wants the partners on side.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a disappointment and I will believe it is operational when I see 100 or 120 school <Col N="36" /> attendance officers working in my constituency and all over the country, dealing with the problems of children who are dropping out of school. It is not comprehensive enough. It is a grave disappointment that two and a half years into office, the Government produces this Bill &ndash; an academic exercise which will not make one iota of difference to the problem of truancy.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Education (Welfare) Bill which offers a radical and imaginative departure from the traditional approach to the problem of non-attendance and early school leavers. My opportunity to speak on this issue is especially timely given a conversation I had yesterday with a 15 year old constituent. She dropped out of school at 14 years and was absent for the year. Not one individual from the formal education system came to find her or to inquire of the circumstances which led to her being absent. A year later, only the intervention of a local youth worker, who encouraged her to return to school and spoke on her behalf on her reintroduction, resulted in her being brought back into the system. That child is enjoying being back in school and is thriving in the school environment. The structures proposed in the Bill will ensure such a child cannot come so perilously close to being lost to the rights and advantages of education. As drafted, the Bill is a courageous and bold recognition of the needs of those most at risk of suffering educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>More than 10,000 teenagers leave the education system each year without a qualification. The Bill puts in place another element in a framework of successive initiatives launched by this Government to target interventions towards this group. Earlier measures recognised and addressed the vital importance of linking schools to families through the extension of the home-school liaison service to every school classified as disadvantaged; the targeting of special education needs and the introduction of a needs based system of supports; the extension of the remedial teaching service to every school and the establishment of a new educational psychological service, which is under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious objective of the Bill is to encourage young people to remain in the education system so they get the maximum benefit from it and lay a solid foundation for successful participation in their social and economic development and that of their community. Considerable progress has been made on the development of the curriculum. All these changes need to be underpinned by a strong, up-to-date, legislative framework. The new approach embodied in the Bill does this by addressing the complex issues surrounding non-attendance in a positive and holis<Col N="37" /> tic way, replacing the negative and essentially punitive approach of earlier legislation.</P>
    <P>The key objective of the Bill is to provide a structure to encourage and promote school attendance and by so doing to give our students a solid education basis in later life. We are all acutely aware of the strong evidence of close links between poor school attendance and social and economic disadvantage. This Bill recognises the complexity of the issues that surround and determine school non-attendance and early school leaving, explicitly acknowledging that a multitude of factors contribute to these problems. It creates a forward-looking and proactive support mechanism for children. Its focus is not merely on punishing poor school attendance as was evident in previous Acts but on promoting positive attitudes to school attendance.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the limited school attendance service, dedicated supports are not currently provided to assist schools in tackling school attendance problems. The Bill is radical in proposing a new structure in the form of the educational welfare board to, for the first time, provide dedicated support to schools and to engage with the wider issues surrounding school absenteeism. Recording and reporting absenteeism will allow for appropriate direction of the resources of the new Educational Welfare Bill so that schools which are at the coal face in dealing with this problem are adequately supported. The Bill goes to the heart of our responsibilities and commitments to enhance the life chances of all children through education in its attempts to address the needs of children who risk marginalisation and for whom the mainstream approaches have not worked.</P>
    <P>Early school leaving and absenteeism are hugely problematic in some schools while they barely feature in others. We must ensure enough flexibility so that the board is able to direct its attention where its help is most needed rather than having its resources diverted to engaging in extensive bureaucratic interaction with schools where the problem does not feature. I am concerned to ensure there is enough room for flexibility at local level in the provisions of the Bill. The national structure must be flexible enough to be sufficiently attuned to deal with an issue which is intensively local and community based.</P>
    <P>The issue of why children do not attend, or drop out of school early is not only an educational problem. It is usually a symptom of more wide ranging difficulties in a variety of areas which cannot be addressed through the educational system alone. Many of the reasons are deeply interwoven in the environment and support available in those communities. The Bill makes provision for liaison between the board and 49 specified bodies. The concept of integrated delivery of support services is hugely important, but an integrated delivery with a top down approach is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the work of educational welfare officers must allow a place for people in the area <Col N="38" /> based partnerships and the different community initiatives who have been trying to create mechanisms to support early school leavers. I refer in particular to the recent initiatives being undertaken in Crumlin and Drimnagh. The vital importance of their contribution must be recognised and incorporated. Local structures must be provided and mechanisms in terms of how they will interface with the new national structure must be devised.</P>
    <P>The biggest challenge facing the Bill is how to ensure a prescribed minimum education for every child. As it stands, there is provision in the Bill for an early warning system in the new record keeping measures and then, as a final endeavour, provisions for delivering responsibility for a child's education to the board in the event of the child being expelled and refused admission to school. We need to know what happens in between and this issue must be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is no point waiting until a latent problem has hit crisis point or goes beyond the stage where the child has become marginalised from the system. We need to elucidate the types of strategies and approaches which the education welfare officer will pursue in the event of finding a child who persistently fails to attend and which will be acted on before the situation reaches crisis point and results in expulsion. The Bill does not outline what will be done in a realistic and committed sense of partnership with communities and families to deliver a pooled set of services to children who will otherwise fall out of the system. All this needs to be set out in statute. Otherwise, we risk worthy aspirations going awry on implementation.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains definite and clear provisions regarding the recording and reporting responsibilities of schools. If we want this Bill to have an impact, recording and reporting is not enough. We need to go further and determine the response that follows on from an early warning system. The Bill mentions schools designing strategies and sending them to the board. However, we need to know how we can be satisfied that they will be implemented. There is a need for elucidation on a statutory basis for a framework of practical support for schools, personal plans, case conferences and referral systems to appropriate agencies. We need to know how all the parties relevant to the problem will be gathered together and how action will stem from that arrangement. All these issues deserve attention on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A major issue in Dublin South Central is what happens to children who are in the school system and who may be working until midnight and later which is a common occurrence. How can these children be expected to come to school the next day and participate fully? We must work out the means to deal with the problems of those whose work is interfering with their schooling. We must find some way to support these children.</P>
    <P>The Government's concern that young people <Col N="39" /> should benefit to the maximum extent from the education system does not stop when they reach school leaving age. We must ensure that the 16 to 18 years age group is also looked after, particularly those who are in employment. There must be a system where employers have a responsibility to ensure that further training and educational courses are given to the 16 to 18 year old group to ensure they will not continue in marginalised jobs and risk future unemployment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ardagh for sharing his time. I welcome the Bill because it addresses the needs of a vulnerable section of society, the young people who drop out of school early without a qualification. Many of these young people join the ranks of the long-term unemployed and often get caught in a cycle of poverty from which they cannot extricate themselves. Many of these young people leave school because of the temptation of earning a wage for the first time. In many cases, the wages are low and the job prospects are poor. Some may re-enter the education system through adult education schemes but, unfortunately, many are condemned to live forever in the cycle of poverty created by dropping out of school early.</P>
      <P>The Bill is aimed at tackling the problems of poor school attendance and early drop out from the education system. It is unacceptable that we should continue to tolerate the level of drop out which exists at present. The current attendance system is governed by outdated legislation, mainly the School Attendance Act, 1926. The existing legislation is often implemented in a haphazard manner and has been proved ineffective in many areas.</P>
      <P>I welcome the general aim of the Bill which is to provide a comprehensive national system for ensuring that children of compulsory school going age attend school or, if they do not attend, that they receive at least a minimum education. This aims to raise the minimum school leaving age to 16 years or the completion of three years at junior cycle level. It also aims to establish a comprehensive legislative and administrative system for dealing with school attendance problems and to amend existing school attendance legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill will integrate early identification and intervention in problem cases in the normal work of schools, a move which I welcome. An important point is that the legislation will shift the focus of school attendance from sanctions to addressing the underlying causes of truancy and helping to identify at an early stage children who may be at risk of developing school attendance problems. As previous speakers noted, the Bill will impose a duty on schools to have a more pro-active approach to problems of absenteeism. It seeks to ensure that schools will be more alert to their duty towards students regarded as problem children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has always considered the issue of young people leaving school early with<Col N="40" /> out qualifications as a policy priority. It was highlighted in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Last December the Minister announced that all schools classified as disadvantaged would have a home/school/community liaison teacher and every school would have the services of a remedial teacher. This Bill proposes to bring together the full range of interventions both within and outside school. The previous School Attendance Acts, 1926 and 1963, were enacted to ensure children attended school. They treated those who failed to attend as delinquent and deserving of punishment. The Bill will put in place legislation that will give effect to a system that will seek out the causes of school attendance problems and ways to remedy them. I am satisfied that the Bill will raise the school leaving age from 15 to 16 years or three years post-primary education, whichever is the later. A comparison with the previous School Attendance Acts shows this is a new approach to school attendance and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable us as a society to produce well educated students who are fully developed as individuals with the qualifications necessary to be financially independent and play their part in the economic and social life of the country. Students who leave school must be capable of adapting to the economic reality of life-long learning. Too many young people leave school before the age of 17 without obtaining any qualifications that would make them suitable for the world of work. The State must intervene and ensure these young people receive the education they need and to which they are entitled. The present legislation seeks to ensure students remain in school until they are 15 years of age but this Bill seeks to ensure they have a qualification before leaving school.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned previously, there is a problem with young people leaving school early to take up low paid employment with poor future prospects. In these days of the Celtic tiger and our economic boom this can seem very attractive but often such jobs are the first to suffer when the inevitable slow down occurs. At present when students leave school at 15 years of age they are outside the system and there is no opportunity to provide further help for them. Under the proposed Bill there is an opportunity to radically address this where students will register, and proof of registration will be required to take up employment. Unfortunately, over 10,000 students leave school early each year. There is strong evidence of a close link between poor school attendance and social and economic disadvantage in later life. A recent survey shows that 90% of households classified as poor are headed by an early school leaver. People with low educational qualifications have less chance of employment than those with higher qualifications. A recent ESRI survey made the point that the absence of any educational qualification leaves many early school leavers spending much of their lives unemployed.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill seeks to take a proactive <Col N="41" /> rather than a reactive approach to the problems of non-attendance and early school leaving and seeks to promote positive attitudes to school attendance. The Bill aims to encourage young people to remain in the education system so as to derive the maximum benefit from it and, in the process, lay a solid foundation for successful participation in society.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Bill introduces a new national education board. That is welcome. It will be responsible for the implementation and operation of this Bill and of school attendance policies and activities. It will provide a supportive framework to assist schools and minimise the impact of compliance with the Bill. The board will have a national remit and will appoint education and welfare officers for each school or group of schools who will have responsibility, at local level, for implementing the Bill. It will have two keys roles &ndash; ensuring that every child receives a minimum education and supporting and assisting schools in promoting school attendance. There will be close liaison between this board and the many other agencies that already operate in the local school attendance areas. This close co-operation should ensure that potential problems are identified well in advance. The education welfare officers appointed by the board will provide a positive and supportive role to children and schools and ensure children receive their entitlement to education. The service will vary depending on the extent of the non-attendance problem evident in each area.</P>
    <P>The Bill will ensure our education system will respond in a positive fashion to the needs of that group who are in a vulnerable position in society. It represents a radical new approach to a problem that has existed for some considerable time. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe any Deputy will disagree with the objective of the Bill which is to tackle and resolve the issues of truancy and early school leaving.</P>
      <P>When presenting the Bill to the House the Minister stated it had been drafted to address the needs of those most as risk of suffering educational disadvantage. He went on to say that it represents a radical but necessary departure from the traditional problem of non-attendance. In a major initiative it proposes to put in place a supportive infrastructure to help every element of the system to make its own contribution to tackling school attendance difficulties.</P>
      <P>I hope these are not just fine words and sentiments. However, as we know from experience, the School Attendance Act, 1926, was also strong on sentiment and ideals and yet the Department stood by and let the system fall by the wayside. What evidence do we have that this Bill will be any different?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the Department's record in fulfilling its obligations under the School Attendance Acts is one of serious neglect, under-resourcing and failure to fulfil its obligations. <Col N="42" /> Against this background how can the Minister expect a warm welcome for this Bill that neither pins legal responsibility on the proposed new education welfare service to deliver on the objectives of the Bill nor obliges the Minister to adequately resource the service? </P>
    <P>One must take into account the long-term neglect of the school attendance service when considering the justifiable scepticism among the teachers, school attendance officers, social workers, youth and community workers, probation officers, gardaí and other related professionals in their responses to this Bill. They have all had countless experiences of sitting in health board convened case conferences or planning meetings about young children where truancy is a major problem or perhaps the child's behaviour is causing such a problem that the school can no longer cope. Such case conferences are laudable attempts to deal with the difficulties the child is experiencing but time and again these professionals have come up against a brick wall. They know what services they would like to put in place to keep the children in school. Where services exist the waiting list is so long that the child will be well past any intervention by the time his or her name is reached.</P>
    <P>Imagine the frustration and anger of these professionals, whose hands are tied, as they watch countless young people start on the slippery slope to life outside school, more often than not a life of crime and drug abuse. Imagine the pain and anger of these children's parents who, together with the professionals, know that early intervention is the key. An immediate referral to an educational psychologist may be the answer for the child, a place in a remedial class or smaller class may have stopped the rot but these are not and have not been available for many children.</P>
    <P>Throughout my period as a public representative I have met countless parents in clinics who were at their wits end because their children were facing expulsion from school and the parents were not in a position to appeal that decision or do anything about it, often because of their own difficult circumstances. The reality for a young person who has been expelled is that most other schools will refuse to offer the child a place and that is the end of the child's formal education. We do not welcome that but it is my experience and I am sure it is the same elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>To date, countless young people have simply disappeared from our education system. One or two may have been lucky to have been picked up by some area based initiative or community project, of which there are many, but many have slipped through the net to a life of poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The education of children is of particular importance in any country. Ireland has always prided itself on the standard and quality of our education system &ndash; a nation of scholars. We should be embarrassed at how we as a progressive country have stood back and allowed children drop out of education too soon and enter into a <Col N="43" /> life cycle of poverty. I am sure Deputies are aware of the strong evidence of a close link between early school leaving and social and economic disadvantage in later life. The Minister referred to a CORI study when commending the Bill to the House. This shows that 92% of households classified as poor are headed by an early school leaver and that with low educational qualifications have less chance of employment than those with higher educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>A 1996 report shows that an estimated 15,000 young people opted out of the educational system at some stage. Of these, more than 900 did not attend secondary school. More than 3,000 left before their junior certificate and 7,500 left before the leaving certificate examination. An estimated 85% of those who leave school early come from working class backgrounds or small farms. In a more recent report entitled &ldquo;Resources and Choices &ndash; Towards a Fairer Future&rdquo;, CORI calls for the creation of a society with a place for all, which is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable in the long-term. Among the means for achieving this it suggests is an education system which would enable people to participate fully and meaningfully in developing themselves, their community and the wider society. It proposes that the State should provide the necessary funding to completely eliminate the phenomenon of early school leaving without a qualification by the year 2000. Will this Bill go any way towards meeting this objective?</P>
    <P>The ESRI in its identification of the national investment priorities for 2000-06 have also pointed out that those who leave school without any qualifications are likely to spend much of their lives unemployed. They have also highlighted interventions for children who currently do not make it through the system as the first priority for investment in education.</P>
    <P>Recently a report was published by the Area Development Management which made a recommendation to the Minister for Education and Science on how to tackle educational disadvantage. The report outlines the need for further training and support for teachers and educators working with young people. Speech therapists, educational psychologists, teacher counsellors and literacy support are all necessary features of a successful effort to stop educational disadvantage. Where are these provisions in the Bill? The resource implications of the proposals in the Bill are considerable and will require generous financing. The Minister must recognise this if we are to make any progress in tackling this serious and crucial issue of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>My scepticism, and that of many professionals in the educational field, is linked to some of the facts about the shortcomings in our current education system. These shortcomings are too often directly experienced by young children on a day to day basis in their short schoolgoing lives. These are the children the Minister hopes the Bill will enable to participate in the education system for <Col N="44" /> longer and benefit to the maximum extent from the system.</P>
    <P>I will give some examples of the shortcomings to which I refer. There are still 200,000 pupils in classes of 30 or more in primary schools. Some 500 schools are still without access to a remedial teacher. Schools lucky enough to have a remedial teacher generally find that they have so many pupils to cater for that the service provided is often minimal and of little effect. The pupil teacher ratio for special schools and special classes set out in the special education review has not yet been fully implemented. Only one primary school in four receives a psychology service from the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Most commentators will agree that the problem of educational disadvantage begins at primary level. Intervention at primary level is the best way to keep at school children who experience difficulties, for whatever reason. How can we be serious about the proposals to tackle early school leaving and educational disadvantage when these kind of shortcomings exist in primary schools? The problems currently experienced by primary schools because of the shortcomings of the educational psychology service are a prime illustration of my argument. Educational psychologists assess children who present with educational and behavioural problems in the classroom. Such children often may be experiencing a whole range of other difficulties and may well be at risk of early school leaving. They also help teachers to deal with problems such as bullying, advise them on teaching pupils with special needs and maintain liaison with health boards and other agencies.</P>
    <P>Approximately 2,000 primary school pupils will be assessed by an educational psychologist this year. A recent Eastern Health Board report suggests that six times this number may suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A child with ADD must be assessed by an educational psychologist before the school can make an application for funding for special resources or special classes for a group of children. Without the educational psychologist's report, the Department cannot even consider meeting the child's needs. The teacher is then left with the impossible task of managing this child, together with the 29 or more other children in the class. Is this child one of the children the Minister hopes to retain within the education system? He cannot do this without an adequately funded psychological service.</P>
    <P>As we speak, Saint Kilian's junior and senior national schools in Castleview, Tallaght, have 900 pupils and one educational psychology service between them. The principal was quoted recently in the newspapers as saying that he has children who are emotionally disturbed and who need help. These are the children whom the Minister thinks this Bill will enable to remain in school until they obtain a qualification. That same principal went on to criticise the level of help given by the Department when an application for special resources is granted. He said he had a visually <Col N="45" /> impaired child and that that child would be worth one-eighth of a teacher. Another principal was quoted as saying that his school is allocated four hours per week of a special teacher's time for an emotionally disturbed child. He said this allocation was completely inadequate and presumably would not facilitate him in keeping this child in school.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that the Education Welfare Bill is flawed because it is set in the current context of an inadequately resourced primary school system. In terms of the Bill itself, it is a totally inadequate response to the problem of early school leaving. As I have already suggested, early school leaving will only be resolved by providing support services to enable schools to offer a range of assistance to pupils at risk of leaving school early. Resources will also be needed for out of school activities in the community. Whereas the Minister takes account of the wider picture of early school leaving, he fails to do anything about it in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes statutory duties and responsibilities on school principals, boards and teachers and expects that this will resolve the issue. There is not a commitment to provide extra resources to ease the increased workload which will follow for teachers, principals and board members. Little or nothing is offered to assist schools with the pressing problem of discipline. What exactly is the school supposed to do with the child who is persistently absent or indulges in unacceptable behaviour in the school? The TUI in its response claims that appropriate sanctions are not specified in the Bill which does not give the board of management the right to enforce the code of discipline and does not require parents to accept the school's code of discipline.</P>
    <P>The Bill is almost silent on the rights of the child in that there is not a legal right of the child to the appropriate support services. There is not a system of any appeal for the child or its parents where they might feel they are not being treated fairly or have not been provided with the necessary support or services. The National Educational Welfare Board will not automatically have teacher, parent or management representation. The teachers unions have already made known their unease at the absence of a teaching representative and have predicted that problems of an industrial relations nature may follow if this is allowed to be the case.</P>
    <P>The provision that deals with expulsion from schools is seriously flawed. The Bill proposes to wait until a child has been expelled before considering the supports and services he or she may require. Surely it would make more sense to address the child's needs before the matter reaches the crisis stage of expulsion. The Bill makes boards of management responsible for finding a suitable place in some other school for a pupil who has been expelled. It is beyond me how this will work. Will an alternative school agree to take a pupil who has been expelled?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> The role of the new education welfare service requires further clarification and the duties of the welfare officer need to be specified. A crucial element of the welfare service will be its ability to work alongside the many other professionals involved in the child's education and welfare. This type of successful working in partnership can be achieved only where there are clear boundaries and no dereliction of duties. Already home-school liaison teachers have begun to express fears that their positions could be redefined to include some kind of enforcement role in terms of school non-attendance. Such a move would be disastrous for a service that has been very successful to date in fostering the vital links between home and school for some students.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not place any obligation on employers to ensure early school leavers continue their education in some form. This is despite a suggestion from the Minister that the Bill would include a scheme under which all school leavers under 18 would have to maintain their links with the education system on a part-time basis. The Bill fails to address the question of pupils who work long hours outside school hours which disrupts their performances when at school. I had hoped the Bill would place some obligation on employers in respect of students who work at night or at weekends.</P>
    <P>An innovation of the Bill will be the registration of all children being educated outside the school system, such as at home. Registration will involve assessing such education to ensure it is up to minimum standards. Whereas this is a welcome development and parents who chose to educate their children at home must be in some way accountable for the level of education they provide, it is unfortunate that this provision is included in a Bill which is perceived by many of these parents to deal with truancy and social disadvantage. Those who have chosen to educate their children at home are unhappy at being included in the same Bill. Such families have a commitment to education. Those parents feel the Bill is punitive in tone and that the standards used to assess home education may be arbitrary. They also point out that the Bill fails to mention supports for home education, such as grants for books or an information service.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not address the question of why so many young people with their whole lives ahead of them abandon the so-called best years of their lives for a life of unemployment. Many of those who leave school early claim there is no link between what they do in school and what they do outside school. Such discontinuity occurs for cultural and socio-economic reasons and it involves not only the child's ability to cope with school but also the school's inability to cope with the needs of the disadvantaged child. People who live in poverty will always choose an immediate opportunity to secure an income over the longer term benefits of an education because they have to cope with the daily demands of life.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is to have any real effect on those at <Col N="47" /> risk of early school leaving, it must address these issues. Schemes such as the home-school liaison service, Breaking the Cycle, the Early Start Initiative and the initiative for eight to 15 year olds at risk must be expanded and made available to all disadvantaged communities. Youthreach courses, the educational psychological service and the remedial teacher and counselling service must be expanded and pupil-teacher ratios must addressed</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has set a target of 90% for leaving certificate completion by the year 2000. This goal cannot be reached without investment in the types of measures I have outlined, combined with efforts to redress the serious shortcomings in the primary school system. I hope the cycle of disadvantage can be broken to give all young people a chance to share in Ireland's Celtic tiger economy, but it will not be broken by this Education (Welfare) Bill. I urge the Minister to take on board the comments from the many professionals who are concerned about the inadequacies of this Bill and not let this opportunity slip.</P>

      <P>In discussing this or any new legislation, it is paramount that we are mindful of the fact that we are going through the most rapidly changing period for education since the setting up of free education in the 1960s. This is thanks in no small way to the Minister and his Department.

      <P>It is important to acknowledge the excellent improvements that have been consistently put in place since he took office. The announcement of the figures for next year's budget already indicate a 16% increase over the 1999 budget. That is what it is about, getting the funding and having the vision to put in place programmes.</P>
      <P>The various sectors involved in education may argue about the priorities and how we should spend that huge increased budget. Deputy Hayes referred to a few of the internal arguments and they will be ever present, but it is important that we have provided the money and that we argue our priorities here and outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must view all of this in a positive light. In these debates, we should acknowledge the progress, but we should also highlight any weakness or short-coming in the area of education. Many speakers mentioned the 10,000 people who slipped through the net by leaving school early. As chairman of a health board a few years ago, I made a point publicly that the greatest heart<Col N="48" /> break for me was the lack of facilities for severely and profoundly mentally handicapped people. One of the difficulties highlighted was the fact that the matter was falling between two Departments, the Departments of Health and Children and of Education and Science. Most of the difficulty has been resolved and I depend on the Minister for Education and Science, in particular, to improve matters because if anybody is to make progress in that area, it will be him.</P>
    <P>The recently announced National Development Plan provides £5.35 billion for spending in this area over the next seven years. At the core of this is an enormous investment to tackle adult literacy problems and to provide for massively expanded second chance educational facilities. Recently CORI highlighted that four out of ten adults left school before the age of 15. We must address that problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the National Development Plan represents the largest ever commitment to the improvement to the education system at primary, secondary and third levels. The sheer scale of proposed spending is mind-boggling to those of us who lived and worked through the era when the country was on the brink of bankruptcy. In particular, I remember 1986, not just because we were in Opposition but because some of the more illustrious gurus at that stage suggested that we would either hand over to a small group of business people or to the International Monetary Fund, which was demanding its money back. We have moved fairly rapidly since then. Undoubtedly the economic prosperity we now enjoy is due in large measure to the commitment to the education of pupils by parents and the teaching fraternity and the quality of the education they provided over the years.</P>
    <P>Recent surveys, in analysing our prosperity, have shown that quality education underpins economic success and enhances the quality of life. I accept that there are rare exceptions to this rule, namely, people who become millionaires despite leaving school at 12 years of age. However, these people are exceptions and should be recognised as such. For the average person, further education will enhance their quality of life and improve their prospects.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on adult literacy and second chance education in the national development plan is indicative of the Minister's enlightened approach. There will always be a certain number of people who will slip through the education net in their early years and the provision of appropriate educational facilities to them in subsequent years is crucial in terms of helping them to enjoy rewarding lives. It is important, however, that the number of people who drop out of the education system is kept as low as possible. We could be <i>blasé</i> and say that there will always be people who will slip through the net. However, it is incumbent on us to ensure that the figure remains low. I welcome the fact that the Bill focuses on the need to drastically reduce the number of <Col N="49" /> people who miss out on educational development in their early years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which regulates non-recognised schools, a matter to which Deputy Clune also referred. It is my understanding that there are about 200 families who educate their children at home. At its recent conference, the group Home Education Network criticised the Bill on the basis that it requires parents who choose not to send their children to recognised schools to allow inspectors to observe the instruction being given. The group believes that this is an infringement of the constitutional right of parents to educate their children. This criticism is based on a misreading of the Bill and it is an unnecessarily pessimistic view of how the Bill will be implemented.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the best interests of a child are served by their being educated in a recognised school because this gives the child access to the professional expertise of the teaching staff, the facilities offered by the school and, very importantly, the social interaction resulting from mixing with other students. However, where a parent has the dedication and willingness to educate their child, this too must be a viable educational model.</P>
    <P>There will be obvious concerns about the ability of parents to provide the range of facilities provided by a recognised school. However, few could doubt the commitment of parents who educate their children and help them develop. In that context, the Bill provides a happy medium because the right of parents to be the primary educators of their children is upheld and the role of the State in protecting the welfare of its citizens is fulfilled through the requirement that educational inspectors must be satisfied with the quality of the education to be provided. I accept that a High Court judge indicated that the State had not laid down a clear definition of the term &ldquo;quality of education&rdquo; and difficulties may arise as a result. However, the Minister is taking appropriate and early action in that regard.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to attendance at school and school discipline are welcome. Truancy can be a significant problem in many schools. In addition to undermining a child's individual education, it can disrupt the work of other pupils and teachers. It is difficult to imagine any single measure that could solve the problem of truancy, which has many causes. The Bill draws together a number of existing initiatives as well as introducing some additional measures. It provides for each school to have an appropriate attendance strategy and legally ties parents to the requirement to ensure that their children attend school up to the age of 16. This is particularly important and, together with the requisite level of resources, it should lead to a significant easing of the problem in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I am concerned that the level of truancy is related to the availability of part-time work as a result of the benefits of the Celtic tiger. In that regard, we must ensure that <Col N="50" /> the provisions in the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, are implemented. Depending on their circumstances, children may be encouraged to leave the education system and partake of the finance offered by part-time employment. Parents have a critical monitoring role in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome on a number of grounds &ndash; it underpins the commitment to educational development contained in the national development plan; it provides a sensible balance between the welfare of children, the obligation of the State and the rights of parents in respect of the education of their children; it establishes a national welfare board to promote and foster in society and in families an appreciation of the benefits of education and it streamlines the process of tackling school truancy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dennehy for sharing his time and I compliment him on his excellent contribution.</P>
      <P>It is often said that Ireland's only real natural resource is people, which is a truism. We must recognise that education plays a fundamental role in the development of that scarce resource. The foundations of the current economic prosperity we are enjoying lie in decisions taken in respect of the education system 20, 30 or 40 years ago. For example, brave and courageous decisions were made by Ministers for Education, such as Donogh O'Malley, who, against the odds and to the horror of officials in the Department of Finance, came to the conclusion that free education was not only attainable but was necessary. Paddy Lynch and the team who put together the OECD document, &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo;, gave sense and direction to the development of education, particularly technological and scientific education, in this country. A great deal of the prosperity enjoyed in the areas of IT and micro-electronics arises as a direct result of those decisions. It is often forgotten that Paddy Hillery's welcome decision to establish the regional technical colleges represents an extraordinary piece of clear thinking.</P>
      <P>Education is extremely important. I do not say so out of a sense of political sycophancy but when we consider this period in ten or 15 years we will recognise the valid, valiant and welcome contributions made by the current Minister for Education and Science. A number of the criticisms made against him are unfair and unfounded. A previous speaker criticised the Minister in terms of the resources being provided. It is clear, however, that he has been remarkably successful in wresting resources from the Department of Finance. As a former official of that Department, I appreciate, perhaps more fully than other Members, exactly how difficult that is to achieve. If one considers the provisions on education in the national development plan which was published earlier in the week, it is obvious that remarkable progress is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome development because it <Col N="51" /> addresses a number of fundamentally important issues, namely, why children leave school, why they are sometimes driven out of school and the circumstances which prompt them to surrender their future, either for some short-term gain or because there is some impediment to the way they are realising their capacity and full potential.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest tragedies in this country is that our society has become modern, developed, progressive and confident but, as the two previous speakers stated, we are faced with huge numbers of people dropping out of the system. In so doing, they are robbing themselves of their own potential and robbing the nation of the realisation of their true capacities. This is a serious issue and the Minister was right to address it in the way he has done in the Bill. Deputy O'Shea correctly stated that there are wider issues with which we must deal but we cannot deal with every issue in one Bill. There is a theory in economics &ndash; the theory of the &ldquo;second best&rdquo;&ndash; that if you cannot solve all of the problems at once, you solve individual problems incrementally. Although this is sadly referred to as a theory, it has certain pragmatic benefits.</P>
    <P>The Bill is aimed at addressing a major problem with which we are all familiar, namely, the tragedy of young people who, for whatever reason, cannot continue their education. I welcome the Bill in broad terms. I will focus on the issues in the Bill which concern me, although I welcome the Bill and feel the Minister is achieving an enormous amount.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a statutory enforcement of the existing imposition on parents and on the State in this regard. I am deeply concerned by the manner in which home educators have responded to the Bill. I do not take the view that their response has been hysterical; they have a reasonable basis for fear. They are fearful that an ideological viewpoint might gain the upper hand in the inspectorate and that a situation might arise where they would be faced with more stringent tests of their capacity to provide education than would professionals in the education system. I have sympathy with that viewpoint. I know many home educators who did not choose that path easily. They did not choose it because they were quirky, they chose it in some circumstances because of what they perceived as a necessity for their children and because they perceive that the formal education system has failed their children. It is important to recognise that.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy O'Shea, I welcome the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board. The Minister is right to establish a stand alone board. I cannot understand the criticism of this. To suggest this is the equivalent of the crazy proposition of Ms Breathneach as Minister for Education to set up regional boards, which were nothing other than an entirely spurious layer of bureaucracy, is to misread the Bill in a profound sense. The National Educational Welfare Board will focus on the welfare of the children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> Having praised the board, and the Minister for producing it I will express my concerns about the focus of the board. I am familiar with many failures in the education system, as is every other Member. It may not be politically correct to refer to them and it is certainly not politically judicious to refer to them because when talking about the education system, a person who is critical faces the wrath of a strong and entrenched profession. I do not know of any case where formal home education has driven a child into the difficulties experienced by children involved in truancy. It is the failure of the formal education which arise in their cases. I have experience of dealing with the Department under this and previous Ministers in this regard. I drew to their attention a small minority of cases which are ignored, where children, because of personality clashes or deficiencies in teaching, are driven out of school &ndash; they do not leave school. I know of one case where a teacher was clearly incapable of teaching but was allowed to continue in that position with vulnerable children in a deprived working class area. I drew this issue to the attention of two separate Ministers and the Department. The Department did nothing. The welfare of children is threatened in such circumstances by formal education. I hope the National Educational Welfare Board will address that issue.</P>
    <P>It does not just happen at primary level, it also happens at secondary level. Last year I had to intervene in a case where an absolutely brilliant child, a child who went on to score almost 600 points in the leaving certificate, had a major problem with a teacher. When the issue was brought to the attention of the principal, he said he was aware of the problem, and had been for years, that the teacher should not have been in the system but there was nothing he could do. I hope the National Educational Welfare Board, when it comes to fulfil its task, will look at the internal factors which drive children out of school as well as those which cause them to leave of their own volition or because of a failure of parental guidance.</P>
    <P>I accept the Bill. The provision of strategies for schools will have to be funded. All too often principals and assistant principals find themselves so tied down with day to day detail that it is hard for them to plan or to involve themselves with strategies.</P>
    <P>Although I have some small doubts about the Bill, I commend it to the House. I hope the Minister will address the issues the home educators have brought to his attention. These are serious issues raised by serious people who should be listened to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this legislation. Members will highlight issues of concern to them in the course of the debate. The Bill, as presented, allows us an opportunity to comment on matters of concern which are not fully addressed in by it and I hope the Minister will take some of those on board on committee stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> Most of us recognise, at a time when the Government has an unprecedented level of resources available to it, that we must ensure that those resources are applied as effectively as possible in education to ensure that current problems in the sector are addressed.</P>
    <P>The education sector has hugely improved over the past 30 years. The farsighted decision of a former Minister, Donogh O'Malley, to provide free education was mentioned. Deputy John Bruton has said on more than one occasion that decision had a huge impact on the economic development of the State. We sometimes speak of the cost of education but every pound spent on education is an investment in the future. The political decisions of the 1960s and 1970s are now reaping an economic reward for the State.</P>
    <P>Today the tremendous progress at third level is noticeable. A record number of students now attend third level education and there is a course to suit almost every leaving certificate student. If we looked at that sector alone we would think all our problems had been solved. We must, however, concentrate on the other side of the coin &ndash; the number of people leaving school early with barely any education, the number of pupils who find school a complete turn off and the parents who have no interest in education. It is in that stratum of society that the problems exist. We must focus our attention on those people and devise a solution.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for a minimum standard of education, the registration of children being educated at home and compulsory school attendance. I am sure that it will, to a degree, be effective, but the legislation will not work unless it is funded, monitored and controlled. It is always difficult to accept, for instance, that a sizeable number of children leave school before reaching the minimum school leaving age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on a new social partnership agreement were launched yesterday week by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and me. All the social partners acknowledged fully the enormous contribution which partnership has made, in both economic and social terms, while at the same time recognising that much more remains to be achieved.</P>
      <P>Substantive negotiations are now getting under way and, as with previous agreements, the proceedings are subject to confidentiality strictures in order to protect the negotiating positions of all. However, each of the social partner pillars, including the Government side, has made clear on many occasions in the recent past their own priorities and concerns.</P>
      <P>I requested the NESC in November 1998 to prepare a strategy statement on the new national programme of social partnership. I very much welcome that the NESC has responded to my request with a comprehensive and imaginative strategy. The strategy statement outlines a vision for the development of society over the coming decade which reflects the aspirations of all sectors of society while addressing the challenges faced by Ireland in the new global world economy.</P>
      <P>The Government welcome the conclusions and recommendations in the strategy statement, which outlines how the NESC believes its vision can be effectively realised. As with previous social partnership agreements, this NESC statement will serve as a focus for negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>As to the timeframe for concluding the negotiations, we will need to see how the negotiations go before making any predictions on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions given that five have been taken together but will co-operate with the Chair by asking two specifically about the national agreement. What is the Government's timetable for completion of the <Col N="55" /> agreement? Why so far has the Government failed to bring forward convincing proposals for performance related pay in the public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no fixed timeframe for completion of the agreement. The earlier rounds of Partnership 2000 will end around Easter so there is not a particular urgency to complete it but it would nice to make as much progress as possible before Christmas. On the public service pay issue, in July 1988 I indicated the urgent need to relate public service pay more closely to performance. Discussions with the public service committee have been ongoing in this. The NESC strategy confirms the greater emphasis on the relationship between public service pay and performance. That is the general context of the Government's approach. While there has been much discussion and some agreement, those discussions are not completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> report of the main recommendations of the NESC report, published on 2 November, the fourth recommendation was to the effect that further reductions in income tax should be introduced with priority being given to personal standard rate allowances; in other words a bottom up approach rather than a top down approach. Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Government has accepted that recommendation in the spirit in which it was made by the social partners within NESC which also included the Government representatives?</P>

      <P>If, as I assume, the Taoiseach read the NESC report, what did he think of it? Did he find it a rather bland statement of conventional wisdom containing few hard decisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the report but Deputy Bruton will acknowledge that what we have is the short version. We will now get the detailed and comprehensive report. There is not a great deal in the report that is new to the agenda. Most of it goes back to the past and looks forward to the new period and highlights a number of areas we could look at. Perhaps in the detailed statements we will see some of its broader thinking. Having said that, the NESC argument is that something that has worked well should not be radically altered but that some refinements should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take one of the hard issues that I think is not dealt with in the NESC report which I was disappointed with. If we bring such people around a table they should take some hard edged decisions that would help politicians to take even <Col N="56" /> tougher and more necessary decisions. That seems to be absent from what I consider a bland report. What about immigration, an issue which will not go away? What is the Government's policy on immigration in view of the acute labour shortages in Ireland today, skills shortages at all levels? Is he in favour of it? How much immigration does he want? Where does he want it from? How does he propose to facilitate it? How does he propose to ensure that humanitarian considerations are given their proper place alongside the economic needs of our country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not answer questions on every detailed aspect of what is and is not in the NESC report as I would have to answer for every brief. Generally, the Government has clearly welcomed immigration; 44,000 gross is the latest figure predicted for this year. By and large all those people are coming back. Practically all, given that they are at an age that allows them, are coming back into the labour market. They will also go into the housing market and that is welcome. We do not know whether that level of immigration will continue and whether the economy will continue to grow at the rate of almost 10% &ndash; the figures next autumn will show that the rate is close to that level. In terms of immigrants we are following the UN High Commission rules more liberally and on a more humanitarian nature probably than most European countries. I am in favour of that but at the same time we have to be careful in how we do it. We cannot allow a perception to prevail where our systems are overwhelmed. We have to balance it so that people will be in different parts of the country and must protect them as best we can. We support that idea and it will be reflected in the Bill which is near finalisation.</P>

I agree with the Deputy's view that when people come into this country they should be cared for. Pressures have arisen in this area. At present a number of hotels, including four star hotels, and guesthouses in this city are full with immigrants. They must be dealt with in a more comprehensive manner and that is the policy of the Departments that are trying to co-ordinate this issue.</P>

      <P>There are currently three people with a disability employed in my Department. This represents 1.7% of overall staff numbers. This figure shows a decrease on last year when the Department employed four staff with a disability equating to 2.4% approximately. It should be stressed that the 3% target relates to the Civil Service as a whole and it is not always possible to ensure that all Departments individually fulfil the quota at all times because of staff movement and promotions. Furthermore, my Department has a request from the Civil Service Commission for the assignment of an officer from one of the panels for people with a disability. We will continue to recruit from these panels on a regular basis with the aim of ensuring that the target quota is reached in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>I am not quoting but informing the House of the facts. I am entitled to refer to numbers and these range from 0.5% to 2.4% over ten Departments. The Taoiseach has a specific responsibility in a number of them. What steps does he propose to take to bring the figure up to the 3% level set in the middle 1970s?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to my Department and the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Chief State Solicitor, for whom I have administrative responsibility, although with regard to the latter that will not always be the case, I would like to see a higher figure and the achievement of a 3% limit. I have urged my Department to employ people from the different panels.</P>
      <P>A difficulty was brought to my attention when we considered the figures for 1998 earlier this year. The scheme is operated on only three panels. The telephonist's panel in my jurisdiction is controlled by Eircom, so I cannot employ telephonists. That is probably the strongest panel. With regard to the clerical officer panel of the Civil Service Commission, we have submitted an application for another person.</P>
      <P>Given the movement of people within Departments in recent years we should try to adhere to the target in the clerical officer grades. It is the only panel available to us and in so far as we can recruit from that panel &ndash; there are vacancies &ndash; we will. I support that approach and have advised the administration and personnel sections in my Department accordingly. That would bring the figure up to 3%.</P>
      <P>I should not stop at 3%. If we can recruit more people who are suitable we should do so. I have argued previously that the definition is broad enough because it refers to having a tangible impact on the functional capacity of recruits to do a job or having an impact on their ability to function in a particular environment or leading to a discrimination in obtaining or keeping employment of a kind which they would otherwise follow. That definition should allow for a reasonably broad spectrum, but there are only three panels. One of them is closed to me and the other is very limited, which means I am effectively only left with the clerical officer grade.</P>

      <P>Following the announcement of the Government's decision to establish an inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, officials from my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has a role in facilitating implementation of the decision at which we arrived, met with representatives of the group, Justice for the Forgotten, on 9 October and again on 14 October.</P>
      <P>At the 14 October meeting, the representatives for the group asked that a period of four weeks be allowed, where no action would be taken to set the process for establishing the inquiry in train, to allow the group to make a further submission on the nature on the inquiry to be established and the legal and technical issues involved. The Government considered this request subsequently and agreed to it. A submission is awaited from the group.</P>
      <P>The Government called for a public inquiry into Bloody Sunday after the publication of a very detailed assessment of the new material in relation to Bloody Sunday and the Widgery Tribunal.

      <P>The families have from the outset sought a full public inquiry. The case put forward by the Government, which is based on all the legal advice and assessments in which we have engaged with the representatives of the committee, is that, until we have a comprehensive assessment, it would not be in the families' best interests to proceed with a public inquiry. While much was said about the Bloody Sunday inquiry, an enormous effort first had to be made by the previous Government before it became a reality, something I have acknowledged on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>I met the entire group of families, which comprises about 40 or 50 people, in April and suggested to them that they follow the advice given to us. To be fair to the families and their representatives, they believe they have substantive advice. If that is so, it must be put in an order in which it can be examined. I will not reject it if they can do that. The experience of the other inquiries, particularly the Bloody Sunday inquiry which is proving very fruitful and working very well, indicates that this preliminary work should be carried out. A legal person of substance should carry out this work because I do not think a substantive case exists at present. I must be honest about that.</P>

Does he agree with me that the experience of all tribunals, not just those relating to atrocities or alleged atrocities, shows that if the preliminary work is carried out well in advance and the terms of reference are narrow and carefully drawn, they will be effective? However, if a tribunal's terms of reference even include the kitchen sink because people do not know where they want to look most closely, the result will be nothing more than a corridor of frustration.

We are talking in many cases about people outside this jurisdiction. However, facts do not seem to exist when information is checked. It would seem that a private investigation would elicit such facts. If a public inquiry were to seem merited at that stage, I would be the first to call for it.

        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that the request for a public inquiry into the appalling atrocity of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings must be seen in the overall context of the inquiries which have taken place on this island over the past 30 years? Unfortunately, there is a history of some inquiries having clearly been whitewashes. There is a fear among the relatives and others who wish to see the truth arrived at in this case that a private inquiry will not bring <Col N="66" /> the full truth into the open. Given the allegations of collusion, involving security forces and so on, which have been made, there is a fear that the private inquiry proposal is being made to cover up certain elements of this issue.

      <P>We hope that an eminent legal representative will be able to sift through the existing facts which have been collected by the Garda, Government Departments or by groups such as Justice for the Forgotten to ascertain whether a substantive case can be made. The person appointed to do this job would not be interested in anything other than doing a good job. There are eminent people here who could do that in a credible way which we could stand over. A public inquiry which does not have any focus other than the atrocities of 1974 will not succeed in getting us to the position we want to reach.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there is plenty of evidence north of the Border that where a tragedy occurs and where people believe, rightly or wrongly, that the full truth has not been disclosed or that some facts have not been made publicly available, that the initial sorrow is followed by anger, resentment and bitterness? In those circumstances, and having regard to the letter from the Justice for the Forgotten group, to which Deputy Quinn referred, in which it informed a number of Members of the House that its lawyers are currently in the process of submitting the case for a public inquiry to the Taoiseach, will the Taoiseach consider the case in the most positive light possible in order to ensure that the great and merited feeling of injustice experienced by these people can at least be lessened? Will the Taoiseach take whatever action he can to ensure that all of the facts of this case will be made available?</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation that the surviving victims and relatives of victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings sought a public inquiry from the outset, is he aware of the anger among families and campaigners in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings cases at the claim made by former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, that they had not sought a public inquiry? Can the Taoiseach confirm that a senior official in his Department was given this very information by Mr. Wilson, in spite of the fact that the Justice for the Forgotten <Col N="67" /> group's demand has always been, as the Taoiseach has again confirmed, for a public inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in both the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and Seamus Ludlow cases, the families and representatives have sought an inquiry. Mr. Wilson did an excellent job in a short time and his recommendation, which was accepted by the Government, was that we should ask an eminent legal person to conduct the inquiry, having regard to all of the facts and then decide how to proceed. I do not think there is any dispute in regard to the legal advice received. We will wait and see what the representatives come up with and decide where to go from there.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Society Commission published the document referred to by the Deputy at the end of October to facilitate a wide debate on the important issue of widespread and easy access to information technology and the Internet for all.</P>
      <P>The document examines various options for allowing people to access the Internet in public places such as libraries, Government offices, and schools. It also deals with the issue of providing everyone with an e-mail address. It is particularly appropriate that this document is out now as we are in the midst of the Netd@ys initiative being promoted by the Information Society Commission, to allow people find out more about the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent research has shown that, while the uptake of the new technology in Ireland is <Col N="70" /> increasing very significantly, access remains spread unevenly across society. It is vital that we take steps to correct this, to avoid creating a two tier information society as between those who have access and those who do not.</P>
    <P>Widespread access is important for a number of reasons. We want the entire population to be able to share in the benefits of the information society. The Internet opens up great opportunities for people to communicate with each other, to establish new links with people of like interests, concerns or circumstances, and to access information or services instantly. The level of access and use of computers and the Internet in society is increasingly seen as an international benchmark of preparedness for the information society, not least by multinational companies making location decisions. The Internet is now used extensively within the public service as a means of providing information to the public. In addition, a host of improved service delivery options will become available, with greater efficiency and more effective use of resources in public administration. Just yesterday, I launched a set of guidelines for public sector websites which focus on making our websites more user friendly.</P>
    <P>Provision of public access points to information technology and the Internet will provide opportunities for people who do not have computers in their own homes to avail of and explore the new technologies in a structured environment. Some of the options being considered will also allow for on-site instruction or assistance by skilled staff. This will be important for people who are unfamiliar with or fearful of new technology and for parents who want to catch up with their children, or who have concerns about children accessing harmful material on the Internet.</P>
    <P>The discussion document sets out the various options for consideration in a clear and structured manner. The commission has invited submissions by 30 November and I encourage anyone who has any views on this matter to respond. If the Deputy, or any other Deputy, has views I am sure the commission would be happy to receive them. I understand the commission intends to prepare a follow-up paper with specific recommendations once it has considered the submissions received. This is an important and worthwhile exercise and I commend the commission for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be a directory of e-mail addresses and, if so, how will we avoid people being sent an enormous amount of junk mail once their e-mail address is generally accessible? Has the Taoiseach considered whether the ISDN line, which is being promoted as state of the art for e-mail use, is state of the art or whether we should leap over it and invest in more advanced technologies for speed of data transmission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The e-mail addresses of the <Col N="71" /> Deputies are already in the telephone directory and I am not sure how&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree computers in the home are a vital part of the equation. In terms of how this will be done, the Information Society Commission has said people are organising this from a commercial viewpoint. It is the commission's view that it can be done in a more structured and protected way to avoid some of the difficulties to which the Deputy referred. Commercial companies in the business are already orchestrating this and are operating to their advantage.</P>
      <P>The Information Society Commission's main concern is that many people will be left out. Although Netd@ys is having a good effect, it will not get it right in one go. It is, however, giving people access and it is in libraries, local authorities, community offices, unemployment action groups and so on. The Information Society Commission believes the best way to do this is for it to be organised, for the State to be involved and for it to be done across the board so there can be restrictions rather than have commercial interests taking over. The commission believes it will be done one way or another and that there will be some control if it is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the cost of calls will be key to whether people use the net, particularly if the cost is too high? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that we are doing enough to promote competition in this area to bring costs down? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Various figures have been put forward on how much costs will be brought down when installations in respect of global connectivity and global crossing are in next year. Costs may be one sixteenth of today's costs and that will create an enormous amount of competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second part of the Deputy's question, he is correct, and when the president of Intel was in Ireland, I took the opportunity to spend one hour with him. We had a fascinating discussion on where things are heading over the next five or ten years. He believed that we would have several global crossings in this country over the next decade but did not recommend that it should all happen together. He said in his view, and he has considerable experience in the United States and elsewhere, this will hit us sooner than we think. He predicted that in five years, we would have a number of these operators and that costs would be one eightieth of the 1999 figure. I would find it difficult to argue with a man who has probably led the Internet revolution. If that is the case, cost will not be a factor in five years' time but perhaps other issues will. The president of Intel believes this will change the world in terms of costs, <Col N="72" /> access, education and so on in the first five years of the millennium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the development he just described will radically alter the philosophy of education in the sense that education in the past was about the imparting of information but now information will be freely available to everyone at the touch of a button and that the role of education in the future will be to train people to have judgment and discernment to know what information is relevant and what is not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it will change things dramatically. The technology fund, which this Government set up, R&amp;D and the money which needs to be spent on these initiatives aimed directly at homes to assist people will change society. The action plan on the information society has highlighted some of the issues involved. It will result in considerable change over the next five to ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Post offices have always been the main outlet for delivery of social welfare pensions, allowances and other payments and delivery of these payments constitutes a very significant part of the business of local post offices. There is a contractual relationship in place between my Department and An Post for the delivery of this service. The present contract between my Department and An Post will reach its end at the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following detailed consideration of this matter the Government has decided that the term of this contract should be extended for a further three years up to the end of 2002. This decision was made having regard to the needs of social welfare customers, the working relationship with An Post over the years and the Government's wish to con<Col N="73" /> tinue to use the post office network as the principal outlet for payment of social welfare pensions and other payments. In the light of the Government decision my Department entered into negotiations with An Post on the terms and conditions which would apply during the period of the extension. In the normal course these negotiations would take some time to complete in view of the size and nature of the contractual relationship and of the need to accommodate any additional requirements in the area of service to my Department's customers.</P>
    <P>The new contract must also comply with the requirements of EU legislation on the procurement of services of this kind and the Government was cognisant of these requirements in making its decision. Following the decision a third party with an interest in the area of payments and payment systems raised certain legal issues regarding the extension of the contract with the EU Commission. In accordance with standard procedures in these cases, the Commission has referred the issues raised to the Government for response and my Department is dealing with this. The issues raised are complex and require detailed examination and a response to the Commission will be forwarded by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>Clearly it would be inappropriate to finalise a new contract while the issues raised with the Commission are still under examination. The necessity to address these issues and not to prejudice the potential interests of other parties requires that no new contract be signed until the matters raised have been resolved. As soon as these issues have been resolved the negotiations will be resumed with a view to having a new contract in place at the earliest possible date. Pending finalisation of these issues, social welfare payments will be delivered, as before, in the normal way.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that he is in a terrible tangle over the An Post contract? Does he accept that he initially wanted to put the contract out to tender but that he and the Government reversed engines prior to the local election, when the Government decided to open negotiations with An Post? Now I understand we have not one but two complaints to the EU Commission about the present state of affairs, which the Minister might confirm. We have no arrangements in place and the contract is due to expire at the end of next month. Does the Minister accept that he has been grossly irresponsible in his handling of this business?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that at all. The Government was faced with a situation which was a legacy of the previous Government, which blandly agreed to extend the contract. The condition of that extension was that the matter would go out to tender at the end of that extended period. On the basis of advice received, the Government decided, in view of the impact this would have on the delivery of service around the coun<Col N="74" /> try and particularly on rural post offices, to renew the contract in effect. That is still the Government's position. As I said, one party has made a complaint to the Commission based on two issues and that is being examined by my Department.</P>

      <P>There are two complaints. The first of these complaints related to certain competition-related articles of the EEC Treaty and the other suggested that the decision breaches the obligations laid down by Council Directive 92/50/EU. Those are two separate complaints. However, that is not the point I want to come to &ndash; it is the further attempt by the Minister to point the finger and blame the last Government. Does the Minister accept that on 1 September 1998 he met the Minister for Public Enterprise and made it clear at that meeting that he wanted to put this contract out to tender and that there were other organisations seeking to get in on this business? He complained at that meeting that the An Post service was expensive in comparison with alternatives and that was the basis on which he decided he wanted a cheaper option to An Post. It is misleading, unreasonable and unfair to suggest that the tangle the Minister is in has anything to do with the last Government.</P>

      <Quest>if all outstanding arrears will be paid to widows, widowers, pensioners and other benefit claimants in the context of budget 2000; and the cost of discharging these arrears.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23639/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing arrangements, where a claim to old age contributory pension, retirement pension, widow's or widower's contributory pension or orphan's contributory allowance is made late, arrears of up to 12 months are paid. This applies to any claims made after 1 January 1997. Under regulations which I made in 1998 additional arrears beyond 12 months are paid on a sliding scale.</P>
      <P>For pension claims made prior to 1 January 1997, arrears of up to six months can be paid. I also made additional provision this year for payment of further arrears on a sliding scale at an estimated cost of £10 million. My Department has paid arrears in 1,887 such cases. Work on identifying additional cases which may be entitled to arrears payments is continuing.</P>
      <P>Regardless of when late pension claims are made, there is provision to pay further arrears in certain cases, namely where the person is proven to have been incapable of claiming on time, where wrong information was given by the Department, <i>force majeure</i> or where the claimant is currently suffering financial hardship.</P>
      <P>It is a long-standing requirement of our legislation that claims should be made within a certain time and that payment of arrears may be affected by failures in that regard. Similar provisions are a feature of the legislation of other countries. These restrictions are justified by the need to exercise supervision and control of claims and by the need to exercise sound financial management and control of public expenditure.</P>
      <P>The changes which have been made in this year's budget and going back to 1997 represent a significant improvement in the position that has applied heretofore and strike a reasonable balance between the need for effective management of the system and for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty. Pensioners with late claims now receive full arrears for a certain period of their claim plus a proportion of arrears over the remaining period of the late claim. Full arrears for the entire period of the claim may be made in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman has taken a particular interest in this matter over a number of years and the provisions which we have made represent a full response to the issues raised by him. My Department will ensure that any outstanding cases where arrears may be due will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The Rainbow Coalition did nothing about those entitled to arrears pre-1997 although it did something about post-1997 arrears. When I entered office I gave a commitment to this and a sum of £10 million was included in last year's budget to take care of a proportion of the arrears prior to 1997. I was the first Minister to do anything substantial in this regard. As Deputy Broughan quoted from a hurler on the ditch, I will quote from the Ombudsman who looked at this issue and stated in his most recent report that it was a historical problem &ndash; much of the cause of which pre-dated my entry into office &ndash; which, in the light of developments since 1997, that is, since this Government came into office, has now been &ldquo;significantly ameliorated&rdquo;. He also accepts that because of the improvements made since 1997 the pension arrears issue is &ldquo;unlikely to continue to be of major concern&rdquo; to his office and that he intends this report to mark the end of his office's involvement with the general issue of lost arrears of con<Col N="77" /> tributory pension.

      <P>The reality is that the Minister's Department did not pay money owed to entitled claimants &ndash; in some cases for up to 44 years, which is an unbelievable state of affairs. The Ombudsman was harsh in his criticism of the Minister and his Department throughout his report. The general point stands. An allocation of £17 million in the budget on this day fortnight would dispense with this problem. The Minister seems to be constantly changing the rules on this. A few weeks ago he visited Sligo and in a newsletter for pensioners, widows and widowers he stated he would listen to people looking for their justified arrears after 12 months.</P>

      <P>The report &ldquo;Towards a Senior Euro Pass&rdquo; was commissioned by the Social Affairs Directorate of the European Commission and was undertaken and published by Age Concern England at the end of 1997. It recommends that EU states should establish a senior euro pass card that would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities. Age Concern noted that the senior euro pass is about &ldquo;citizenship and about the civil challenge of providing a social environment wherein older Europeans would be more effectively mobilised to live enhanced lives of constructive leisure&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Age Concern envisages that each EU member state would create its own euro pass agency under the auspices of a central euro pass secretariat which would be funded by the EU Commission. It suggests that national euro pass agencies be <Col N="78" /> financed by paying an annual or once-off charge for the use of the  senior euro pass and/or charging service deliverers for the use of the euro pass brand and logo. The report &ldquo;Towards a Senior Euro Pass&rdquo; was circulated at the Meeting of Contacts Points Group on Older People in Brussels in December 1998 with an informal invitation to submit observations.</P>
    <P>The issues involved are complex as the range of concessions envisaged cover a wide range of agencies and activities. Each EU member state operates its own scheme of concessions for older people. These schemes operate both in the private and State sectors. For example, in the travel sector, a variety of travel concessions are granted by most EU member states to retired pensioners. The scope of these concession schemes and the reductions available vary widely from country to country. CIE participates in the rail-Europe senior scheme which gives concessions to those aged over 60.</P>
    <P>The role of my Department in matters relating to the senior euro pass is to submit observations in conjunction with other Departments, statutory and non-statutory bodies on any action taken to implement the proposals of Age Concern England in this report in so far as they affect the business of this Department. The administration of the euro pass itself is outside the remit of my Department.</P>

Since 1997 investment in the service has increased from £300,000 in the previous Government's budget to £1.2 million in the last budget. The service is now available not only in two centres in Dublin and Limerick, as was the case when the Government took office, but in nine centres throughout the country. They also include the establishment of 100 family and community centres &ndash; the target is 50 centres by the end of 1999, up from ten in 1997 &ndash; and the further development of local offices of my Department to provide improved family services. Pilot projects are already under way in Cork, Finglas and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The bringing forward of significant initiatives in the next budget and subsequent budgets to respond to the child care and child support needs of families are important priorities in the review of the action programme. The ministerial group on child care, of which I am a member, is considering the findings of the interdepartmental committee which recently reported to the Government. My Department has significant and substantial responsibilities which are relevant to child support matters. These responsibilities include the Government's social inclusion commitments, income support provision for families which includes child benefit paid to over 500,000 families with 1.2 million children and the development of family policy.</P>

      </i>The review of An Action Programme for the Millennium confirms the Government's commitment to advancing the goal of bringing the old age contributory pension to £100. It further extends the £100 commitment to all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002. This year's budget delivered increases of £6 per week in all personal pension rates, well above the average inflation rate and representing an increase of £11 per week since the Government came into office. Over the lifetime of the Government, all social welfare <Col N="81" /> pensions for older people will be increased in line with increases in average earnings.</P>
    <P>The Government in the review of the action programme is committed to putting families at the centre of all its policies, addressing the care requirements of older people, setting new targets for pensions and putting in place a coherent system of support for families with all their caring needs.</P>

      <P>I keep a copy of the modest document, the Action Programme for the Millennium, near me at all times. However, the couple of miserable pages on an inclusive society are less than ambitious. They do not cover many of the key elements mentioned in my question. In relation to supports for the long-term unemployed, does the Minister agree the Government should be aiming in the budget in a fortnight for a significant increase in payments, which would be linked to average income, of at least £6.50 a week and up to £10 a week as discussed by the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs under the chairmanship of Deputy Noel Ahern?</P>
      <P>In view of the many submissions received from bodies such as the Seniors Parliament and other senior citizens' groups, does the Minister agree they should be able to look forward this year and not in 2002 or later to payments of £100 a week which were promised? In relation to family supports, all Deputies were impressed with the level of research carried out by the interdepartmental group on married, cohabiting and one parent families. Has the Minister given any further consideration to the introduction of a household responsibility payment of some type? In relation to the Child Care 2000 proposals, has the Minister given any consideration to the cost of child care payment which was advocated by that and other groups?</P>

      <P>In relation to the long-term unemployed, it is the Government's view that as many increases as possible should be given in light of available resources on all possible occasions. However, this is where the Deputy's party and mine diverge because Fianna Fáil's philosophy is to get as many long-term unemployed people off social welfare and into jobs.</P>

      <P>Our record speaks for itself. A total of 200,000 jobs have been created since the Government took office. A total of 80,000 people have left the live register, many of whom were long-term unemployed until the Government took office. They had no hope of a job but this changed because of the economic conditions created by Fianna Fáil led Governments. The economic developments have helped the long-term unemployed and the biggest drop in the live register is in the area of long-term unemployment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> I am delighted the Deputy mentioned old age pensioners because the Government's record speaks for itself in this area. The biggest increases for old pensioners were introduced in the last two budgets and this trend will continue. This contrasts with the miserable increase given by the Labour/Democratic Left/ Fine Gael Government of 2.5% to old age pensioners when inflation was also 2.5%.</P>

      <Quest>the number of claimants formerly in receipt of small farmers assistance who have had a reduction in payment following their transfer to the farm assist scheme; the number of new applicants for farm assist who have been refused any payment; the amount paid under the small farmers assistance scheme in 1998; the estimated figure for that scheme plus farm assist for 1999; and his views on whether further measures are necessary to relieve poverty and hardship for many farmers and their families.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, which introduced the special arrangements for farmers on low incomes, was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1999, and is effective from 7 April 1999.</P>
      <P>Up to the week ending 12 November, 9,202 applications were received for farm assist, comprising 2,478 new applications and 6,724 in respect of claimants formerly in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance, widow's non-contributory pensions, pre-retirement and disability allowances. From the total number of applications received, there are currently 6,904 farm assist claims in payment of which 1,570 are new applications, 4,975 are former smallholders and 359 comprise claimants transferring from widow's non-contributory pensions, pre-retirement and disability allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the application form completed by former smallholders, many indicated that their circumstances had changed since their last assessment. Reviews of these cases are ongoing. At present 3,352 claimants who have had their means reviewed have received an increased level of payment, 947 have had a reduction in payment while 63 have had no change. A total of 743 claims for farm assist have been disallowed on means grounds. This figure includes applications from farmers not previously in receipt of a payment <Col N="83" /> from my Department and those on other social welfare schemes who applied for farm assist. It is open to anybody who is dissatisfied with a decision of a deciding officer to appeal it.</P>
    <P>In 1998, £27.8 million was expended under the smallholders unemployment assistance scheme. It is estimated that approximately £32 million will be spent this year under the smallholders unemployment assistance and farm assist schemes. I have included in the Estimates a provision of £38 million for expenditure for next year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that farm assist represents a worthwhile improvement in the financial provision for low income farmers. It is of particular benefit to farm families with children because of the special disregard in respect of children but also provides increased payments to couples without children and to single farmers on low income.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the high levels of flexibility of the modern Irish workforce and the progress to full employment, there should be provision through the social insurance system for a pay related element in unemployment benefit in view of the fact that it may increasingly be paid for short periods of time to claimants between jobs.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a pay-related benefit with unemployment benefit was first introduced to the welfare system in 1974. It was gradually reduced over a number of years from 1983 onwards until it was finally phased out in respect of new claims from July 1994.</P>
      <P>The discontinuation of the scheme at that time was part of the policy of directing available resources towards those most in need by increasing the basic rate of payment rather than through pay-related supplements. This was in line with the views expressed in 1986 in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare which recommended that pay-related benefit be phased out as basic payment rates were increased.</P>
      <P>By way of illustrating the impact of this policy direction, it is worth noting that since July 1994 when pay-related benefit was phased out, the basic rate of unemployment benefit has increased by some 20.5% compared with an increase in the cost of living index of some 10.3% over the same period.</P>
      <P>I am of the view that the policy direction which gave rise to the discontinuation of pay-related benefit in 1994 remains equally valid today and I have no plans, therefore, to re-introduce a pay-related benefit scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy referred to a member of this Government, it was Barry Desmond who introduced the phasing out in 1983. It was an approach supported by the Commission on Social Welfare. The Deputy asked in a previous question about the position of the long-term unemployed and protecting them. Research into poverty shows that those on long-term unemployment are more liable to fall into poverty. It is for that reason more resources have been devoted to schemes for those in long-term rather than short-term unemployment.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual.</P>
      <P>One exception to this rule is made in the case of widows, widowers and other lone parents who are sick or unemployed. Where a person who is in receipt of a widow-widower's pension or one parent family payment satisfies the relevant contribution conditions, they may be entitled to receive disability benefit or unemployment benefit at half rate for a period of up to 15 months, in addition to their long-term pension payment. Furthermore, if they are entitled to a widow-widower's pension or one parent family payment at a reduced rate, for example on the basis of insufficient PRSI contributions or on account of means, the rate of that payment is also increased up to the maximum level for the duration of their claim for disability benefit or unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that in its submission to him today the National Association of Widows in Ireland makes a valid point about the position of widows, particularly those with young children? It is not so long ago since it occurred to a number of colleagues in this House. It is very mean of the State to allow a widow with a lengthy stamp record end up on either half rate or no rate of disability benefit. Most often it is a woman who is the survivor. As there is only a small number of women in such a position, surely it would take a small amount of money to rectify this injustice and give people a little extra scope, particularly widows with children?</P>

The number of widows or widowers with children is surprisingly small by comparison with the overall figure. Out of more than 120,000 widows and widowers there are 11,000 widows with children. Since coming into office, I have substantially increased payments to widows over <Col N="88" /> the age of 66 and to widows under 66.

Will he accept that the case of the National Association of Widows in Ireland is well made and that there are unfair anomalies such as the fact that widows cannot claim a carer's allowance?

      <P>Like every Member of this House, I tend to agree that widows, particularly those with young children, have grave difficulties. Obviously, we are all aware of these problems. I have looked in great detail at this issue but the difficulty is that if one makes changes in some areas, it will cause discrimination and inequity in other areas. We must be careful, particularly in view of what happened over the years in relation to equal treatment in this area. However, that is not to say I do not accept that more should be done. This is one of the reasons the Minister for Finance in the Government's first budget increased dramatically tax allowances for widows. This issue will be considered in the future.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to allow the mixed rate insurance scheme, which at present covers old age pensions, to cover disability and invalidity.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties which gave rise to the need to introduce the mixed insurance pro rata pension arrangements do not apply in the case of other contingencies such as illness.</P>
      <P>The problem in relation to entitlement to social insurance pensions for people with a mixture of full-rate and modified-rate PRSI were highlighted by a number of groups, including the Commission on Social Welfare a number of years ago. At that time, many people who entered insurance at the PRSI Class A rate early in their career and subsequently became insured for periods at the public service modified rate, faced problems in qualifying for a retirement or old age pension payment under the social insurance system, despite having contributed at the Class A rate for significant periods. Those concerned were not entitled to maintain their insurance cover for retirement or old age pensions by the payment of contributions on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Accordingly, in line with a commitment in the National Programme at that time, special arrangements were introduced for old age (contributory) and retirement pension purposes in 1991 to deal with these problems. The revised arrangements provided for the payment of pro rata pensions to the people concerned, which are in proportion to the periods of insurance they have completed at the Class A rate. These arrangements are similar to those which apply under EU regulations to people with a mixture of insurance in a number of different EU member states.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of these arrangements in 1991, a number of further changes have been made which are of relevance in this area. For instance, PRSI Class A contributions are payable by all new entrants to the public service, whether employed on a permanent and pensionable basis or otherwise, with effect from 6 April, 1995. In addition, the qualifying conditions for entitlement to the old age contributory pension were significantly eased in 1997, when entitlement to reduced rate pensions was extended to those with yearly averages of between ten and 19 contributions. Under this measure, many former public servants who had already qualified for <i>pro rata </i>pensions became entitled to enhanced pensions. As a consequence of the introduction of the measures I have outlined, many of the difficulties which gave rise to the need to introduce the pro rata pension arrangements have now been rectified.</P>
    <P>On the Deputy's proposal for the introduction of pro rata disability benefit and invalidity pension schemes, it should be noted that public servants paying modified rates of PRSI have their own occupational sick pay arrangements. Accordingly, there is no need for separate social insurance provision for this category of employee in the event of illness. Furthermore, all public servants employed after April, 1995 are insured at the PRSI Class A rate and are covered for all social insurance benefits, including disability and maternity benefits, old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of this Government's key objectives is the creation of an inclusive society where everyone has an opportunity and an incentive to participate in the social and economic life of the country.</P>
      <P>The global target adopted in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy is framed in terms of &ldquo;consistent poverty&rdquo; as defined by the ESRI which combines low incomes with the experience of enforced basic deprivation. Combining both these elements is considered by the ESRI to be a better measure of the extent of poverty at any given time than simply considering either part in isolation. In this regard, the results of the latest ESRI research, &ldquo;Monitoring Poverty Trends&rdquo;, are very encouraging with the numbers experiencing consistent poverty falling from 9% to 15% of the population in 1994 to 7% to 10% by 1997 &ndash; I hazard a guess that that would have continued over the intervening years &ndash; with the original NAPS target virtually achieved. In light of this progress, I have announced ambitious new targets to reduce consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004.</P>
      <P>Having a job is recognised as the best route out of poverty and, as such, the dramatic progress made in reducing the numbers of unemployed has had, and continues to have, a very beneficial impact on the overall numbers in poverty. Since this Government took office, some 200,000 net jobs have been created and the live register has fallen by 77,000, or 30%, to its lowest level since 1982. Nonetheless, social welfare payment rates remain a central factor in determining trends in poverty. This Government is committed to at least maintaining the value of social welfare payments in real terms and, recent years have seen significant increases in excess of inflation. In the review of the Programme for Government, there was a commitment to increase all social welfare pensions for old people in line with average earnings over the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>Between 1995 and 1998, social welfare pay<Col N="91" /> ments increased by 13% to 14% compared to a total rise in the consumer price index of less than 6% and an increase in gross average industrial earnings of about 11%. Furthermore, all social welfare rates are now at or above the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare meeting a key target of both Partnership 2000 and NAPS. We have reaffirmed our commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week and further undertaken to increase the non-contributory pension to this level by 2002. In addition, we have committed ourselves to increasing social welfare pensions for older people in line with average earnings over the lifetime of this Government. This reflects a real improvement in the living standards of those dependent on welfare payments which, together with the dramatic progress made in terms of employment creation, have provided substantial real increases in the incomes of lower income households and a marked reduction in deprivation.</P>
    <P>The trend in numbers falling below relative income lines is also a matter of concern to this Government. Sustained increases in relative income poverty can be an early indicator of future problems regarding social exclusion and thus needs ongoing monitoring. The future direction of social welfare rates generally is under continuing review in my Department. All relevant research and publications from the ESRI, Combat Poverty Agency and others such as the National Pensions Policy Initiative and the NESC inform that process. This must also take account of wider budgetary and employment considerations and will be complemented by other developments such as the introduction of a national minimum wage, the implementation of the Employment Action Plan and the outcome of the current discussions on a new partnership agreement.</P>

      <P>I am pleased by the Minister's last comment. It is a type of Pauline conversion for this Government. However, he deliberately misses the key point of the question which refers to relative income. It is a fact that because social welfare increases were pitched at the 40% poverty line, as defined in NAPS and other organisations, that the figures in this question are correct and that in relative terms poverty has been increasing. Is it not essential, therefore, that today fortnight the Minister and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will be able to ensure that social welfare payments will be linked to average incomes or perhaps even to go further to average industrial earnings in the case of many of the key payments? Is that not the basic way for those on social welfare who are not working to try and ensure that these figures do not re-emerge in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hopefully there will be another partnership agreement. It will include significant pay rises, <Col N="92" /> will it not? Does the Minister agree that social welfare payments should keep pace?</P>

      <P>The commitment on old age pensioners was a new cast iron commitment which was made in the review of the programme for Government. Indeed, on the experience over the past two years, the increase in those schemes has been way in excess of the average income over that period. We will be endeavouring as best we can to eradicate poverty. As I said, the unambitious targets which were set by the Government, to which the Deputy's party was a party, have already been reached long before the term of the NAP strategy while this Government was in power.</P>

      <P>The same qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension apply to all insured people, both employees and self-employed. These qualifying conditions require a person to fulfil the following three criteria. First, the person must have entered social insurance at least ten years before reaching pensionable age, which is 66. Second, the person must have a minimum of 156 contributions paid. In line with the recommendations of the Pensions Board, this requirement will increase to 260 and 520 paid contributions from April 2002 and April 2012, respectively. Third, the person must have a yearly average of at least ten contributions paid or credited from 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the date of entry into social insurance, if later, and at least 260 contributions paid. The reduction in the yearly average requirement from 20 to ten contributions was introduced in November 1997, leading to a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension. Where a person has a yearly average of between ten to 14 contributions, he/she is entitled to a pension rate at 50% of the standard maximum rate while those with averages of between 15 to 19 receive a pension rate equivalent to 75% of the standard maximum rate.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, where a person fails to satisfy the second and third qualifying conditions set out above, he or she may qualify for a mixed insurance <i>pro rata</i> pension if a mixture of full rate and modified rate social insurance contributions have been paid.</P>
      <P>The pension arrangements to which the Deputy refers were introduced last April, in line with the Government's commitment to extend contributory pensions coverage to people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension. These relate to a specific group of people, namely, self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988, when social insurance was extended to the self-employed, and who, through no fault of their own, could not qualify for a pension as they did not satisfy the standard requirement of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
      <P>An old age contributory pension is, therefore, now available to those self-employed people who were aged 56 or over in April 1988 and who have at least five years' contributions paid since then. The rationale behind this five years' paid contribution condition is to ensure that entitlement to a pension is limited to those who have made some reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers. Payment is at a flat rate of 50% of the standard maximum rate with equivalent increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable. The pension is not being extended to employees as that group is not in the same insurability position as the self-employed group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider these arrangements to be fair, <Col N="94" /> reflecting, as they do, a certain consistency of commitment to the social insurance fund and I have no plans to change this particular pension arrangement for the groups mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    <Title>Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I spoke about my overall view of the Bill. I welcomed the intent behind the Bill and much of the contents of the Bill are laudable, but there are a few provisions in the Bill and a few matters related to the broader education question which still need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the fact that one sector of the education system, third level, has been funded to a substantial degree in recent years. This is a welcome development. The free fees initiative, which was put in place by the previous Government, is working well. We are now faced with a situation where almost every leaving certificate student who wishes to pursue some form of third level education is able to do so. However, we must look closely at the opposite end of the spectrum. Consideration must be given to the funding allocated to the primary sector and the lack of funding provided for those people who are most vulnerable as far as primary education is concerned.</P>
      <P>We must note with concern the number of students who are leaving school early. We must also be concerned about the number of students at primary level for whom school appears to be little more than a baby-sitting service. Unfortunately, many of these pupils come from families where a premium is not placed on education. There is no great incentive for such families to ensure that their children pass through the full national and second level system of education. We must impress on them &ndash; a broad programme is required in this regard &ndash; that the best opportunity to provide economic choice and freedom to all sectors of society rests with the education system. We can put in place various social schemes, budgetary schemes and laudable policies dealing with social inclusion, but if we do not ensure that the most vulnerable children in society have full access to education, particularly at primary level, it will be difficult to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned by the statistics relating to the numbers of children leaving national school with <Col N="97" /> basic difficulties in terms of their numeracy and literacy skills. It is wrong that children are able to pass through the primary sector and emerge with difficulties in this regard. This matter must be tackled in a thorough fashion by the Minister and his officials. I am sure many studies have been carried out to discover why this problem persists. It is difficult to accept that, in a country with a booming economy, such difficulties still exist. Those people who escape the primary net without having proper numeracy and literacy skills can be literally written off in terms of their future job and career prospects. That problem must be nipped in the bud.</P>
    <P>The Minister can introduce any number of laudable policies and any amount of legislation but unless basic problems of this nature are tackled it will be difficult to make progress. When he is considering how to spend the huge additional budget available to him following the announcement of the National Development Plan, I hope the Minister will place at the heart of his policy and philosophy the need to invest sufficient and substantial resources in the primary sector so that no child will fail to complete national school or leave it without adequate numeracy and literacy skills.</P>
    <P>I wish to address a number of other aspects of the Bill. First, the number of children who drop out of school at an early age. The Bill deals with truancy which continues to be a problem. Perhaps we have not done sufficient research to discover why so many people drop out of school at 14 or 15 years of age. I accept that we must consider the economic circumstances involved. As other Members stated, some children, because of the economic circumstances in which they are reared, are often encouraged to take up part-time employment. This often puts an end to their educational prospects.</P>
    <P>My party's spokesperson on Education, Deputy Richard Bruton, has suggested on more that one occasion that children who leave school at 14 or 15 years of age because their families need the income they earn at work should receive some form of payment from the State to encourage them to remain in school. That suggestion has not been accepted by the Minister or his officials and from time to time it has been rubbished by the Minister and his colleagues. However, when we consider that people can draw unemployment benefit assistance when they reach 18 years of age and that third level students aged 18 or 19 receive grants, surely we could introduce a system whereby 16 and 17 year old children from economically deprived backgrounds could receive a payment. These people would be much better off remaining in education but due to economic circumstances they cannot do so. If we put in place a scheme to assist such students and their parents financially, it would result in many of them remaining in school rather than taking up employment. This would be very beneficial to their long-term job and career prospects. The <Col N="98" /> Minister should reconsider Deputy Bruton's realistic and workable proposals.</P>
    <P>If implemented in its current form, the Bill will place a serious responsibility on school principals and senior teachers to ensure that the relevant records are kept up to date. Any of the teachers to whom I have spoken about the legislation have no difficulty with the concept of the Bill. However, they are concerned about how it will affect their schools. They are worried about the records that will have to be kept, the extra work which will be required and the apparent lack of additional resources and financial grants to allow them to carry out such work. The task we intend to impose on school principals and other teachers is not small and we must ensure that schools have adequate resources to allow them to comply with the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If it works, the Bill will benefit the education system, society and those people who leave school early or have difficulty with learning. If it is to work, records must be kept. Given the level of resources available to them, schools will not be able to keep such records. I hope the Minister intends to put in place some mechanism to address this problem. There is a willingness among school principals and staff to make the legislation work. However, without adequate resources, they will not be able to carry out the duties imposed on them by the legislation.</P>
    <P>If we consider the statistics relating to those children who leave school early, for whom the Bill is, in a sense, designed, it is apparent that the problem is not evenly spread throughout the country. It is not a case that between 5% and 10% of children in every area leave school early. In some schools, generally in the more urban areas, this problem is greater. Therefore, it is not a question of giving additional grants to every school; it is a question of identifying where the deepest problems lie and ensuring that the relevant schools receive the resources they require. That is the key. As already stated, I have no difficulty with the legislation and it will be great if it works. However, if schools are not provided with sufficient resources it will be difficult for the Bill to have a meaningful impact.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the level of remedial education provided is improved. It is difficult for us to accept the drop out rate among students of 13 or 14 years of age. It is easy to see why a pupil who has gone through national school and found it difficult, who has not picked up the basic skills, would leave school at the earliest opportunity. That is where remedial teaching should come in. There are regular debates on remedial education services. No one would say that it is sufficient or that it is cheap and can be done easily. It must, however, be done if we are to provide the broad educational service required by many disadvantaged and marginalised pupils in the State. They need the maximum encouragement possible to keep them in the education sector. When pupils suffer from learning disabilities, they need extra <Col N="99" /> help which can only be provided through the remedial system.</P>
    <P>We debate the appointment of extra remedial teachers often. Deputies from rural areas in particular continually table questions about remedial teachers. The best response we get is that three or four schools will share a remedial teacher. That may have been sufficient 15 years ago but it is now entirely inadequate. Some of these teachers spend as much time driving from school to school as they do in the classroom. That is a poor application of resources. The Minister should give an undertaking to put extra remedial teachers in place. Without them this Bill and other policies for the future of education cannot work.</P>
    <P>We must look at students who suffer from physical disability. This Bill guarantees a minimum standard of education for every pupil in the State. Pupils who suffer from physical disability are currently unable to obtain that minimum level of education. Perhaps as a result of this legislation the Minister will force his Department and other Departments to provide for that minimum level. Last night we spoke about services for people with disabilities. In my contribution I mentioned a case I dealt with at my clinic, where a couple whose four year old child is deaf have to take that child 25 miles to and from school each day. The father in that family has, by choice, given up his job to take the child to school five days a week. The child now has to come to Dublin one day a week. That is a huge burden on that family. The only assistance made available by the State is a grant of £1,500 per annum. How does that miserable grant of £1,500 per annum equate with our desire to provide a minimum standard of education?</P>
    <P>This aspect of education policy will have to be discussed if the aspirations in this Bill are to become a reality and if we are to ensure this certain level of education is provided. As I said at the start of my contribution, money spent on education is not a cost, it is an investment in the future of young people and the State. The pioneers of education expenditure in the 1960s and 1970s are now seeing the results of their work. Hopefully in 20 years we will see the fruits of the decision we are making now to spend more on education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy John Browne. I have listened to many speakers making contributions on this Bill. I have noticed a trend in those speeches; Deputies say we have the best education system in the world, our teachers are the most conscientious, motivated and best educated, but in the next breath we are told that too many children leave the school system illiterate, innumerate and lacking inter-personal skills. We must ask who is responsible for students, particularly primary school pupils, not being able to read, write or count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the INTO claimed that literacy prob<Col N="100" /> lems in primary schools could be completely eliminated within ten years if every six, nine and eleven year old underwent classroom based assessment. Teachers at national school level are among the best there are. From my experience of dealing with them, and having spent a short period as a teacher, I know teachers are well aware of pupils who are at risk and of the problems facing them. The teachers at primary level are not at fault but they must receive provision for resources to help them cope with the increasing problems they face today. There is a need for more remedial and resource teachers. I compliment the present Minister for taking the steps he has taken in the last two years by appointing hundreds of resource and remedial teachers and special needs assistants. His philosophy is to continue in this vein to ensure that in the years ahead, the resources to deal with the problems will be made available.</P>
    <P>Pupils with difficulties such as ADD, dyslexia and mild mental handicap are kept in mainstream primary education. This is a good idea but to ensure these pupils and their peers receive the level of attention they need for their development, there is a need for more resource and remedial teachers and school psychologists. The home-school liaison persons are also essential in helping to tackle many of the problems in our primary schools which result from problems outside of the school system. Help for parents is essential, especially those who do not have the ability to help their own children. Anyone who has been a teacher has seen the difference between the child who is helped at home and the child who is not. The establishment of family resource centres has wrought a transformation by helping children who need assistance with reading and writing and by providing study facilities. Local teachers will tell people that since the family resource centres have been established, there have been great changes in the children educationally and in terms of self esteem.</P>
    <P>Thousands have left the education system without any qualifications. This reduces their chances of procuring good, satisfying, well paid jobs and progressing in employment.</P>
    <P>Other welcome measures include the establishment of programmes, such as VTOS and Youthreach, and post leaving certificate courses. They have been of tremendous benefit to people who left school early without any qualifications. Their self-esteem has been enhanced and these courses have also allowed them to develop talents and skills which were lying dormant and which they could not develop in the normal school system. Many of them have obtained good jobs and returned to mainstream education.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government aim to provide a comprehensive system to ensure that children of compulsory schoolgoing age attend school and, if they do not, that they at least receive a minimum education. This is laudable and it is especially important, given that the economy and society in general has become more <Col N="101" /> complex, that children obtain the necessary education to progress in life. The minimum school leaving age will be raised from 15 to 16 years and that is crucial. I agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who has vast experience in the education sphere, that people leave the education system at too young an age and he referred not just to secondary level education but to third level. Raising the minimum school leaving age represents the first step in addressing this problem and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>The legislation addresses education outside the recognised school system. Undoubtedly, people educate their children to a high standard and are competent, but some are not capable of providing the minimum education that is required. Under Article 42.3.2º of the Constitution the State is required, as a guardian of the common good, to ensure that children receive a minimum education &ndash; morally, intellectually and socially. The State has a responsibility, along with parents who have primary responsibility, to ensure that children receive the necessary level of education. Some people involved in education at home are fearful that there will be too much State intervention under the legislation, but I do not agree. However, it is incumbent on the State to ensure that children attain a minimum level of education in order to prepare them for our complicated world.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board is welcome. It will comprise people who have a special interest and expertise in matters relating to its functions. Board members will not be plucked from the air by the Minister for Education and Science. He must consult the Ministers for Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Tourism, Sport and Recreation. It is essential that there is a holistic approach to the foundation of the board. Section 10 outlines the functions of the board in detail and if they are followed through fully, the education system will be much better off.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is vitally important as it aims to provide for children at risk. It is essential to get to such children when they are young because it will be more difficult to set them on the right path later; as a branch is twisted so it will grow. The best qualified people outside of parents to identify such children are teachers and I have great respect for them. Many of them have identified children who could have taken the wrong path and steered them in the right direction. As Deputy Bradford said, there are worries about implementing many of the Bill's provisions. I agree that where teachers do not have the necessary resources, such as secretaries, etc., it will be difficult, but when the resources are provided under the legislation, the education system and wider society will benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I welcome the Bill, which gives us the opportunity to debate the early school leaving problem and school absenteeism. <Col N="102" /> The Minister outlined his proposals and the people who will undertake to implement them. I welcome the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board but it is important that it is comprised of people who work on a daily basis in the education system. Too often in the past political hacks with little knowledge of how the boards worked were appointed to boards. All Governments have engaged in this type of appointment. However, it is important that people with the necessary expertise should be appointed to the board. Members of the board will be drawn from broad range of Departments, such as Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Environment and Local Government and Social, Community and Family Affairs. Various sections in these Departments are very much involved with young people who drop out of school at an early age.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of commentary about young people leaving primary school and we have a major problem with them. Many are not able to read, write or count and find it difficult to make the transition from primary to second level education. The Minister, and his predecessors have devoted vast amounts of money to this problem and there is now a substantial number of remedial teachers throughout the country. However, in certain areas one remedial teacher services three or four schools and that is totally inadequate. The Minister should aspire to have one remedial teacher covering no more than two schools, especially as his Department and others are awash with money in the era of the Celtic tiger. In parts of County Wexford, one remedial teacher tries to cover four schools which means it is practically impossible to provide an adequate service to students in need of help. I am baffled by how many young people leave school and are unable to read, write or count. I might not be made popular by saying it, but the INTO cannot walk away from this problem.</P>
      <P>We hear all the excuses about classes being too big and that teachers cannot give one-to-one teaching to a student who may be left behind or may be a little backward. Most primary and second level schools are out for the star pupil and are not greatly interested in the student left behind. In the local newspapers, following the junior and leaving certificates, the student who has succeeded in getting 6 As or 7 Bs, or a combination, appears in the photograph. One will never hear about the student who obtained 150 or 200 points and who, despite all the odds, will go on to third level in Carlow, Waterford or some other regional college around the country. That student may have come from a difficult or poor background. These are the people I always admire. I admire as well, those who obtain 6 As or 7 As but the spotlight is always on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be greater interaction between primary school teachers and the Department of Education and Science to deal with the problem of so many pupils leaving school unable to read, <Col N="103" /> write or count. That is where the problem has to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Recently the Wexford area partnership carried out an intensive survey of early school leavers, entitled, Responding to Early School Leaving in the Wexford Area, a copy of which I have sent to the Minister and the Department. Those who prepared the document will call on the Minister as soon as possible to discuss further action. It is a varied document dealing with the extent of school leaving, addressing early school leaving, recommendations, an action plan and all the reasons pupils leave school early. It has highlighted many of the reasons the Minister has stated in his speech such as literacy issues, negative experience of school leading to a sense of failure, low self-esteem among those with literacy problems and the difficulty in adjusting between primary and post primary schools. It also indicated the problems of truancy, mitching and absenteeism which were all regular features of the school career before finally leaving school.</P>
    <P>Nobody is better equipped to tell the Department of Education and Science who will leave school early than the primary teacher. He or she is dealing with the student from the first day he enters the primary school. That teacher, or group of teachers, can say that 70% or 80% will leave before they are 15 years of age or shortly afterwards and will not complete the junior or leaving certificates. The Minister will have to visit the primary schools and discuss the matter with the teachers involved with a view to dealing with the problem at local level. We can pass all the measures and enact all the Bills we wish but unless there is a system to target the retention of potential early school leavers, at an early age, we will not deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Another area which the Wexford survey deals with is that of travellers. It states that of the traveller children entitled to attend primary school only 10% do so. Out of 34 traveller children eligible to attend post primary school in Wexford last year only five did so &ndash; four in junior and one in senior. It is a major problem and one that has to be tackled. The traveller problem cannot be dealt with adequately in any county unless travellers are involved in the education system. This would educate them in the ways of life which are necessary to remain in their own environment, if they wish, and to get them involved in rehousing as part of the community.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an effort to deal with the problem. It is welcome but the Minister will have to look seriously at the recommendations in the Wexford survey, many of which are in line with his thinking: education network, primary-post primary forums to be set up, integrated approach, projects officer, prevention programme for potential early school leavers, a transition project, after school groups, special programme for potential early school leavers and the traveller initiative. I hope the Minister will meet the Wexford area partnership group as soon as possible to allow for an <Col N="104" /> input in the overall conclusions which will be reached in this Bill. This is a worthwhile document and should be reflected in the further Stages of the Bill as it goes through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on education afforded by this Bill being before the House. Having listened to the various contributions I note the wide variety of approaches to the difficulties in the education system. Bouquets have been given to various people and so on. I declare an interest as I was a national school teacher for 20 years but hope I do not have to return to the classroom again. However, that will be decided in the future.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at where we are coming from and what is happening. There has been much criticism of education recently, particularly of those who gave the education system a start, namely, the religious orders. When education was unheard of in Ireland, a century ago, it was the religious orders who stepped into the breach. The nuns and the brothers set up schools in areas where people would not have had the opportunity of an education. By and large they did a fantastic job. Gradually the State has intervened and taken over from them. The money which was put into the various schools by the religious bodies over the years is not being put in by the Government. We must not lose sight of the fact that they gave a tremendous amount to the education system and set it on a firm footing. The introduction of free second level education has built on the good foundation and that must be recognised.</P>
      <P>We must recognise also that we have a good teaching profession which has generally done a good job. Within the teaching profession I would be naive if I did not recognise there have been some difficulties with a small number of teachers. There have been those who did not live up to the responsibility placed on them and thankfully some of those have been brought to justice. There is still a small group of teachers who are not able to cope with the job. The contribution by the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy Michael D. Higgins was very telling. He blamed the teachers fairly and squarely for the fact that some pupils go through the school system and do not come out competent at the end of it. To blame the teachers entirely is grossly unfair because they are not the only people involved in education. Education is about a partnership &ndash; a partnership between the Department, parents and the teachers. To lay the blame so heavily on them was a grave mistake. I was surprised that Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who is a very good university lecturer, professor and teacher, would point the finger so clearly at his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider developments in education in the context of available resources. Teachers can cope only with the resources allocated to them. While the general situation is not too bad, matters can be improved. It would also be naive to suggest <Col N="105" /> that things are rosy. Every year approximately 10,000 students leave the system without any qualifications. More tellingly and alarming, every year approximately 1,000 students who complete their primary education do not proceed to second level education. It is odd to have such a huge drop-out rate between primary and second level in this day and age, when children like going to school &ndash; they do not fear and detest it, as we did. There is also an enormous drop-out at second level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne indicated that there is a huge drop-out rate among members of the travelling community between those who attend primary school and who perhaps start second level but do not spend much time at it. This problem cannot simply be addressed by legislation. It will take much more innovation and effort to get them to return to the school system. They would benefit from it. I taught in a school which contained a number of traveller students. Every year they would be withdrawn from the school around the beginning of May when the weather began to improve. They would spend May, June and probably the rest of the summer on their &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; and perhaps return to school some time in October. It is very difficult for teachers to motivate such children and to reintegrate them into the school to enable them make progress.</P>
    <P>The children themselves are not entirely to blame for these long breaks. It is part of their heritage and culture to travel from their home base for the summer, visit relations and participate in events throughout the country. It is what they are used to. Do we cut across that and compel them to attend school or should we offer them a system more suited to their needs? </P>
    <P>Many pupils are at risk. There may be problems in the family. Their parents could be drug addicts or alcoholics. How do we deal with these children and how can we support them within the school environment so that they will continue to not only attend school but be able to take an interest and do the tasks set to them?</P>
    <P>I have seen children attend school hungry. Is there a system to provide breakfast or lunch for them? I have also seen children attend school following a night of disruption. Perhaps their parents returned home having taken drink and fought all night. Have we the facilities to cope with problems like these and is the home-school liaison service adequate? It is not. Tremendous resources are needed to tip the balance for those students to enable them get a fair chance to learn in school.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis has been placed on the approach to truancy in the Bill. In my 20 years as a teacher instances of truancy were relatively small. When I attended school as a student the local gardaí checked the attendance roles on a regular basis at a time when, again, instances of truancy were small. More recently, those gardaí given the task of school attendance officers have not had time to deal with their responsibilities. <Col N="106" /> Perhaps they do not know how. Very little work has been done on this aspect.</P>
    <P>The fact that gardaí may not have been looking after school attendance reflects more on the question of what to do with a pupil who plays truant. How is the school made attractive to encourage the pupil to return to the school system? From speaking to some teachers I know they look on troublesome students who act the truant for two or three days as a bonus for the other students because of the difficulties of coping with somebody who is very disruptive. How much time will be spent by the teacher dealing with such students rather than attending to the needs of the other students?</P>
    <P>The School Attendance Act, 1926, was negative in its approach in that it specified penalties to be applied to parents if they did not send their children to school. Article 42 of the Constitution, passed by the people 11 years later, contains strong provisions on the rights of parents to teach their children at home. It stipulates that parents are the primary educators of their children. It is interesting that these provisions were laid down so soon after the 1926 Act. It might be useful for a student engaged in research in this area to look at the ethos surrounding those decisions and the discussions that took place on the constitutional provisions and the 1926 Act. Perhaps there was a specific reason for giving parents such responsibility.</P>
    <P>The inclusion in the Bill of sanctions against parents on the question of truancy has annoyed many people in that it also deals with families who have chosen, for their own reasons, to educate their children at home. I have received letters from many families who are of the strong view that this should not be included in a Bill on truancy. I understand that approximately 200 families have chosen, for their own reasons and in different ways, to educate their children. They are entitled to do so under the Constitution. It is very difficult to specify how an education may be imparted. How is it possible to define what is meant by a basic education or to define what is important for a family to instil in their children to enable them become good citizens? At a teacher's conference I attended, a debate was held on the basic items any education system should impart to enable people to live. A geography teacher held strong views on this and said that any basic education system must have a strong understanding of the weather and how it works. Since that is tied into what happens in the polar regions, it could be argued that anyone who did not have knowledge of the polar regions could not survive. The debate progressed with various people adding their tuppence worth until one man said his wife knew nothing of the polar regions or how the weather works but that she was a good wife who served and cared for him and his family extremely well and that she was a tremendous person. It stopped the debate because it became clear that what might be important to one person may not have the same <Col N="107" /> relevance to someone else and that our views can be biased by what we know of ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for inspectors to investigate the welfare of children being educated in the home. How can an inspector do that without full knowledge of the curriculum, the long-term intention of parents for children and the things family members feel are important to them? It would be difficult to form a view on what might be a suitable home education system so we must tread carefully. Nonetheless, I understand why there are concerns and why it would be included in legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>The legislation will also place a huge burden on school principals who will have to record attendances and such matters. Principals in many primary schools of seven teachers or less, most of which are rural, must teach full time as well as carry out a principal's duties, so this will be an additional burden. Schools with eight or more teachers can have what is called a &ldquo;walking&rdquo; principal, but those with fewer teachers will have this additional responsibility. This highlights the tremendous role for part-time teachers in primary schools. In the case of the three to seven teacher school, if the principal had a part-time teacher taking classes for two or three half-days each week, it would relieve the principal to carry out their additional administrative duties and would have a tremendous effect on morale in such schools. Not only would it release the principal to do the additional duties, it would also give pupils an additional face in the school. The part-time teacher might also be someone with an expertise in art or music.</P>
    <P>One item regarding the recording of absence of pupils from schools concerns me. Parents are being asked to send a report to the principal if a pupil is absent, something that has been standard practice. When I was teaching, if a child was absent for a day or two, they always arrived back with a note from their parents indicating why they were absent. That is understandable and acceptable. However, the Bill states that, if the child is absent because of illness, the parents must report it to the school principal and that they must report the nature of the illness. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle in his profession as a doctor would be aware that the certificate he gives a patient out sick from work states how long they will be absent from work but it does not state what is wrong with them because that is part of the confidentiality between doctor and patient. It is a bit much to build into law a requirement on parents to indicate to principals the nature of their children's illnesses. That should not be required in law as it is too strong and it is not required for the workplace in any event. I would like to see that item deleted from the Bill and I ask the Minister of State and his officials to convey that to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another item built into the Bill is rewards for good attendance. That is something which should be taken on board. In our school we had, and <Col N="108" /> probably still have, a system whereby, at the end of the school year, a special presentation was made at assembly time to any child who attended for the full year without missing a day. I had a system in my class whereby any child who did not miss a day during the school year received a special presentation of a Parker pen, and this lasted for years. I remember on one occasion being caught with a remarkable number of six students with full attendance and it nearly broke me on the teacher's salary at the time. Nonetheless, I managed to survive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill. It has given us a good opportunity to discuss education issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss education matters. Like Deputy McGrath, I also was a secondary school teacher. It must be more than 25 years since I practised, so I am retired from that sphere now. Unlike many Members, I cannot wait for the day this Dáil will wind up so that I can retire from politics in general.</P>
      <P>There is nothing more touching to see than a well turned out child, boy or girl, going to school. Most parents take great pride in ensuring their children are presented in an excellent manner and they deserve great tributes for that. That applies to the majority of parents. Nothing is more touching to see than an older child bringing his younger brother or sister with him to school. These are some of the more beautiful things in life. It is great to see people progress. People work hard to see their children are educated and get on well in life. It is the high point in their lives to see their children succeed but sometimes it does not work out like that. Some of the best prepared and best brought up children go off the rails but, by and large, most of them succeed.</P>
      <P>Life by its nature means not all people do what is in their best interest. However, we must strive to help them in every possible way. I often think that our society is geared in a one-track manner towards financial gain and personal success. We often lose sight of the fact that many people in society are not sufficiently well off or cared for to be able to achieve their full potential. It is an unfortunate subject to have to address but it is a fact of life. I do not know to what degree it has been discussed in the debate. I am aware of a school in Dungarvan in which teachers are more involved in containing students than in educating them. That school does not have disadvantaged status and the teachers do not receive any extra assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an unfortunate fact that a significant number of parents abuse alcohol and drugs. We are also faced with the social ills which arise from the fact that there is a significant number of lone parent families in our society. Children who live in those circumstances often have an in-born disadvantage and that disadvantage is not sufficiently addressed. We are selfishly inclined to think of ourselves. It worries me that teachers in urban areas are more preoccupied with containment <Col N="109" /> than education. The problem is not as pronounced in rural areas because it is usually possible to easily identify and solve problems in rural areas. In urban areas, people must contend with the difficulties which arise from substance abuse, lone parent families and broken marriages. It is the children who suffer and they, in turn, make life very stressful for their teachers. Teachers tell me it is impossible to teach the children because they run wild as a result of not being disciplined at home. If the parents are illiterate, they are unable to help their children with their homework and we cannot expect teachers to solve the problem by themselves.</P>
    <P>Over the years, education has been provided in straitjacketed circumstances with certain rules, regulations and procedures having to be followed. The dire circumstances I have outlined cannot be dealt with and class disruption has become a fact of life. I would like to think that this Bill will address that problem. We must look at the spirit of education rather than introducing new legislation and rules. The extension of the school leaving age will not solve any problems. The significant minority of illiterate people is increasing all the time and we will see more and more problems as a result.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Marian Finucane radio programme during the week. One of the topics related to the activities which occur on the streets when the pubs and night clubs close with young people from the age of 14 years upwards misbehaving in a gross manner. Some graphic instances were outlined, particularly about the town of Clonmel and other towns throughout the country. One is forced to wonder whether the education system is failing. We will not solve this problem unless we first admit that a problem exists. We can then set about remedying it.</P>
    <P>The lewd and anti-social behaviour in evidence on the streets is simply unacceptable. A girl or woman cannot walk down the street without being subjected to lewd and horrible remarks by groups of young men. That is an unfortunate aspect of our society. I do not see that happening in Europe or other parts of the world, even in countries which are much less affluent than we are. One will not witness that type of behaviour in China which has a population of 1.2 billion people. The people there are courteous, polite and well behaved. A significant number of our young people display a raucous mentality which is a real black mark against our society. I hope someone in a position of power will attempt to do something about this. It would require three or four Ministers, in addition to the Minister for Education and Science, to do that. Education is fundamental to solving this problem.</P>
    <P>I applaud people who give of their time to educate adolescents and adults in reading and writing skills. The number of illiterate adolescents and adults is much higher than we are prepared to admit. I know some wonderful people who volunteer their time and energy to redress that problem. However, that only happens on a hit and <Col N="110" /> miss basis. One will find good people in some areas but not in others.</P>
    <P>People who are not literate are virtually unemployable. If people do not have their junior or leaving certificates, they will not be employed in even the most mundane jobs. If they cannot read labels and instructions, employers will not be interested in employing them. It is an absolute priority that people be educated. Perhaps the Minister will inform us of the percentage of children, adolescents and adults who are not literate.</P>
    <P>On a note of selfish concern, I know illiterate people who do not vote because they do not want to go into a polling booth and expose their illiteracy. There are probably thousands of such people throughout the country. I know many decent young men and women who cannot secure factory employment because they do not know the basics of reading and writing. I am sure the Minister of State is also aware of such cases. The problem of illiteracy must be accurately identified and addressed.</P>
    <P>When I left teaching more than 20 years ago, I was delighted to see civics being introduced as a compulsory subject in schools. I hoped it would stamp out the bulk of anti-social behaviour. However, that did not happen and the situation is far worse now than it was then. The number of broken homes and the incidence of substance abuse has increased in the intervening period. Affluence creates its own problems. We have many great characteristics but we do not seem to be able to control the affluence we have enjoyed. A significant number of people tend to abuse it, which is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I refer to the problems in schools which we all come across. Some children have handicaps when it comes to learning and expressing themselves. Children who suffer from dyslexia have been mentioned. That is a considerable problem and I do not know if we have the resources to deal with it. The type of remedial teaching being done at the moment is not sufficient to help people with difficulties and handicaps. We are only skimming the surface and are not getting to grips with the problem. I am not criticising the Government or the Minister; we are all to blame. The problem has not been a priority as far as politicians are concerned.</P>
    <P>Remedial teaching is not sufficient. Primary schools may have a remedial teacher for one day or a couple of hours a week. If ten, 15 or 20 children are in need of remedial teaching, they are barely dealt with in the course of that one day. It is a real problem and we are not devoting enough resources to it &ndash; we never have, and that includes this and previous Governments. If we are to use our new found wealth or affluence, it should go to those areas in which the underprivileged need to be cared for.</P>
    <P>I have no time for wasters, people who are badly off because of their refusal to work or to contribute to society, but I have great sympathy for those who are disadvantaged or underprivileged through no fault of their own. We should <Col N="111" /> all be concerned about that group in our society. People with these physical disadvantages, particularly children, should be looked after.</P>
    <P>There is a child in secondary school in my home town who suffers from cerebral palsy. I find it virtually impossible to get assistance from the Department for that child to conduct his education and allow him to take part in examinations. He cannot write like you and me; he does not have that capability. Such problems will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly asked questions about the need for speech therapists in County Waterford. It is hard to believe but the average waiting time for speech therapy for a child in County Waterford is three years. We are really failing people with disadvantages. A national school in Portlaw has a child with cerebral palsy, a child with Down's Syndrome, children with dyslexia and many children in need of remedial teaching. It gets a minimal amount of assistance which does not deal with the problems. People may say the problem is being addressed but it is not. Those are the matters about which we should be concerned.</P>
    <P>We do not have an educational psychologist in County Waterford. If children are unfortunately born with a defect, the means are not there to assist them. There is not an educational psychologist and there is a three year waiting list for speech therapy. God knows how long a child with cerebral palsy must wait. Children might be highly intelligent but they cannot express themselves in writing. How are they to perform in an examination in those circumstances? The considerable problem of dyslexia is one of many which should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I could reel off many problems in respect of schools in my constituency which need to be addressed, including extensions and new schools, but I wish to highlight the fact there are many children with major disadvantages who are not being attended to in a proper and comprehensive manner. That causes me considerable concern and should cause everybody in the House considerable concern. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, convey my views to the Minister? As Deputies, we all encounter many of the same problems. I hope we can further debate these issues, whether in the corridors, in offices or elsewhere. We are not tackling the problems as we should. I hope the legislation is of some assistance but I have seen reams of legislation pass through this House and much of it makes no difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an educationalist nor do I profess any expertise in education, however I am anxious to make a few brief points. The updating of the 1926 Act is overdue. The proposals which will ensure that all will receive at least three years post primary education must be welcomed. The importance of ensuring that all receive an exposure to education is clear. The <Col N="112" /> capacity of those who have remained for appropriate periods in education to secure long-term employment is undisputed.</P>
      <P>The intention to enhance and expand the system of educational welfare officers nationwide is sensible. The current position where school attendance officers are located in so few areas does not reflect the need for this support throughout the country. The process of home liaison officers based in all schools would be a most constructive step forward to ensure not only attendance at school but attendance with positive participation. Schemes which operate involving parents as part of that liaison not only make a valuable impact on the educational welfare of the schoolchildren but have the capacity to open the door to second chance education to the parents of the children most at risk.</P>
      <P>While the Bill proposes positive action to address aspects of the problem, core issues as to the effective direction of resources to maximise every child's opportunity to be engaged by the educational process is still missing. There are areas of Dublin where, on testing the first year pupil intake, it was found that 7% only read at their chronological age while more than 50% read at either two or three years behind their level. Some 17% of four, five or six year olds read below their chronological age. Is it any wonder that serious problems of attendance occur in the post primary sector when students are so poorly equipped to benefit from class work and when, in turn, the family, due to the inadequacy of education which the parents received, is unable to help the children understand the concepts presented to them? </P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal of a minimum three years of post primary education means nothing unless adequate resources are supplied, including teachers at a ratio which can make an effective impact in schools with facilities adequate to allow supportive teaching and family support. There are many employment opportunities, but unfortunately one section of the adult population is not equipped to take up these opportunities due to poor education or because they have never held jobs. Although they are in their late 30s or early 40s, these people, the parents of the students this Bill is designed to serve, find they cannot get jobs, even though their children can. Young people are being encouraged by parents to leave school and take up jobs to join in the nation's growing prosperity and to bring money into the family home. Others, though remaining in school, may work long hours at part-time jobs and this has a negative impact on a young person's ability to study and to benefit fully from education. There must be a special focus on working with employers to develop ongoing education for their employees. Employers should work with local vocational education committees and other interest groups to devise educational steps to success, with certifiable course modules and skills that may ultimately be converted to a national diploma. This would in turn allow access to further education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> This Bill is just one step towards effecting the provision of real education in the Ireland of tomorrow. There is a marvellous parent-teacher innovation in my constituency. The local Sisters of Charity have turned a space in their convent into a resource centre to cater for parents and children, the opening of which was attended by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. The nuns, some of whom are retired, and parents attend the centre daily to help children through their exercises. This is a wonderful innovation and should be supported. The Minister gave some support to this at the opening, but those behind the innovation explained forcefully to me that they need funding to enable the resource to progress. I refer to the Baldoyle resource centre, which is doing a wonderful job. I ask the Minister of State to provide the proper funding for this centre, as it helps the children of families that are not well off and that need support. I ask the Minister of State to bring these kinds of innovations to the attention of the Minister so that adequate funding can be provided for them, and for the Baldoyle resource centre in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents an attempt by the Department of Education and Science to address truancy and the problems of early school leavers in a more comprehensive way than before. No Member opposes the Bill in principle, although they may have genuine concerns about some of its sections. This is just one of several recent Bills and initiatives in education such as the Education Act, 1998, the Green Paper on Adult Education and the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999. It is very important that we have had these debates, as we cannot afford to ignore education. Neither can we afford to become blasé or complacent; education must be kept to the forefront, as our present economic success is mainly due to our well educated, literate workforce. This probably dates back to the introduction of free education, but this country has always had a love for, and appreciation of, education.</P>
      <P>However, we are dealing here with those unfortunates who are marginalised or who have dropped out of school. These are people who are not motivated to go to school or who do not want to go to school, though that may be through no fault of their own &ndash; they may be misdirected or badly influenced. The Bill seeks to address the problem of truancy and non-attendance at school by setting up structures to deal with those issues, which is welcome. This is the first attempt to deal with this problem since 1996 and for that reason I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill forward. The Bill also deals with the issue of a minimum level of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's attempt to address this long-neglected issue, but in an effort to resolve the complex problems of truancy and early school leavers, the Bill imposes statutory duties and responsibilities on school principals, <Col N="114" /> boards of management and teachers and expects that this in itself will resolve the issue. Speakers on all sides have pointed out that there is no commitment to extra resources to ease the increased administrative and personal burdens being imposed. As Deputy Deasy said, introducing legislation is fine, but unless it has financial backup it just gathers dust. Given the huge commitment in human resources which has been made in the Bill without a corresponding financial commitment, the Bill may not be as effective as it is hoped.</P>
    <P>Unlike the recent Education Act, there was very little consultation before publication of the Bill, which has given rise to major criticism from the teachers' unions. The Minister said that since the Bill passed through the Seanad &ndash; where no doubt there was much criticism about consultation &ndash; he and his officials have consulted the education partners. There has also been a major consultative seminar on the Bill. I am confused as to why this did not take place before the Bill was published. Some of the Bill's provisions could have been reviewed and corrected before publication if that consultation had taken place.</P>
    <P>Many of the responsibilities outlined are part of the normal work of many schools, but putting them on a statutory basis, thus obliging the institutions and persons to keep records, to engage in necessary liaison with other institutions and to participate in a range of consultative processes without the necessary supports, does not augur well for the Bill's success. The composition of the proposed board involves different State institutions such as health boards and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. These bodies are all very busy already and the Bill places more obligations on them. Unless they have the numbers, they will not have the time. I recently returned to local government and I was amazed by the number of committees councillors are asked to sit on; being a county councillor is now almost a full-time job. The various obligations of this board will mean its members &ndash; given that they will have other commitments &ndash; will be rendered less effective if they are stretched in fulfilling their duties. The only way the National Education Welfare Board will be effective is if it has sufficient human resources to enable its members to devote time to it.</P>
    <P>The school leaving age has been increased to 16 years, or older if the child has not completed three years of post-primary education. Simply obliging parents to return their children to school will not work in itself. The reasons children drop out of school in the first place are many and complex and often originate more in society and the family than in school. To their credit, teachers have already introduced a range of new programmes independently of the Department's direction.</P>
    <P>They are making the effort, which is not fully appreciated by the Department and those critical of the teaching profession and its unions. They do not appreciate that teachers are trying to prepare <Col N="115" /> programmes on their own initiative which will meet the needs of children who are staying away from school because they are not motivated. This must be recognised. Teachers are designing courses to attract and retain the less academically inclined students. Many of these have been effected at considerable cost to the teachers and administrators involved, as the necessary supports are not in place. As has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>, if this Bill is to succeed, substantial resources must be allocated to meet the needs of early school leavers, to facilitate a drastic reduction in the size of learning support classes, more individual tuition, a team approach, the setting up of units with appropriate specialised equipment for particularly disruptive students, constant retraining programmes for teachers and the allocation of time for co-ordination and planning by the teachers' teams involved. We must review our approach in schools, using the teachers and expertise available to solve the problem. I have experience of how the team approach can be effective. The Minister's officials should note that this approach must be promoted more. This will obviously take extra resources and will also put more pressure on teachers.</P>
    <P>Many constituents have conveyed their concerns about the Bill to me, as I am sure is the case with other Deputies. These concerns have already been conveyed to the Minister but I will quote from a letter to the Minister as follows:</P>
    <P>As a teacher of seven years and now as a person who works within the field of physical disability, I appeal to your good nature to consider my opinions regarding the Bill. I believe the tone of the Bill raises grave concern and indeed goes some way towards contradicting the good initiatives for children with disabilities put in place by the Education Act. Constitutionally, it is the right of every citizen to the best education possible. How is &ldquo;minimum education&rdquo; to be defined? Will it lead to discrimination? The Education Act promotes the rights of parents to choose a school for their child. Indeed, will this wording actively lead to the discrimination of those who wish to attend a third level institution? The Education (Welfare) Bill makes it very easy for a school to refuse a child's admission. It makes it unreasonable, therefore, that a school may publish a good and fair policy on the admission of children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Minister, I have worked with children who have endured great difficulties academically because of a learning disability. Remembering those faces and the satisfaction in working with them towards achieving their own different potentials, I can only appeal to you and your Government colleagues and your Department to remember those who are unable to write to you, those people whose lives will be affected by this Education (Welfare) Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like the officials to bring that concern to <Col N="116" /> the attention of the Minister. It is a genuinely held concern and I would like some response to it. Other constituents are involved in home education and are concerned about aspects of this Bill, particularly sections 15 and 16. They ask questions, to which the Minister will perhaps reply. They ask for instance:</P>
    <P>What experts were consulted in regard to home education? What are the financial implications involved in the assessment procedures outlined in section 15 (4)? In the event of a mother being imprisoned, who would care for the family and what would be the objective of this procedure &ndash; the welfare of the children or the common good? Why is the overall ethos of this section intrusive and threatening? Surely it would be more constructive if it were more supportive and encouraging &ndash; co-operation instead of confrontation.</P>
    <P>These are two concerns of parents which I would like the Minister to address &ndash; the issues of home education and education for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As regards sections 9 to 13, it is not proposed that the National Education Welfare Board will have any teacher, parent or management representation. Perhaps the Minister has made a statement in this regard or I am not reading it properly. The Minister may appoint other people but there is not any reference to a member of the teaching profession being appointed to the board, by right. There is a reference to &ldquo;such other persons as may be prescribed by the Minister&rdquo;. However, unless he gave a commitment on Second Stage or in his reply in the Seanad, it does not appear that a member of the teaching profession may be appointed to the board. This has given rise to a great deal of concern among the teaching profession because it will impinge on them in various ways.</P>
    <P>The proposed board has extremely wide-ranging powers and education welfare officers will enforce its provisions. The power given under section 10(1)(g) to monitor and assess the effectiveness of strategies and programmes aimed at preventing truancy in recognised schools, seems to give the National Educational Welfare Board an evaluative function which would place schools under what has been described as yet another strata of evaluation. Similarly, in section 10(1)(i), the board is given the authority to assess the adequacy of training and guidance provided to teachers relating to matters of school attendance and good discipline on the part of students and to make recommendations to the Minister thereto. This also gives an evaluative function to the board on the matter of the in-career development of teachers. It is possible to read this section as meaning that it is the training programmes, <i>per se</i>, which will be assessed rather than their successful implementation. It seems extremely difficult to separate the adequacy of a programme from its implementation.</P>
    <P>Section 13, which requires the board to comply <Col N="117" /> with policy decisions made by the Minister, clearly curtails the independence of the board. The absence of the teacher representatives from the National Educational Welfare Board is difficult to understand and given the intrusive nature of many of the board's proposed duties, industrial relations problems seem inevitable. Perhaps the Minister will respond to the issue of the further duties and functions the board will impose on teachers and administrators. He should provide resources for them and address the issue of consultation to allow for their input, which is not in the Bill. Will this lead to possible industrial relations problems when the Minister and the Department implement the provisions of the Bill?</P>
    <P>The reason young people leave school at primary and second level is that they are not interested. Their needs and interests are not being met. As a former physical education teacher, my experience is that children who are less academically inclined come to school specifically for the physical education programme. I am convinced that more young people would go to school if there were properly funded PE and sports programmes in many of the inner city schools and schools in disadvantaged areas to which other speakers referred and proper facilities that could be used at night by the communities, which do not have facilities at present.</P>
    <P>Most young people in urban areas are fanatical about soccer and other sports and more of them would attend school if there were better sports programmes. If they attend for a sports programme, they will come in contact with other subjects. I am aware the Minister is trying to put in place a marking system and make physical education a leaving certificate programme. However, it is more important to ensure that all young people, and not only elite groups which will study it for the leaving certificate, participate in physical education. I welcome the provision in this area but it is not the solution.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address this issue because the facilities in schools are totally inadequate? One of the main functions of the board is to promote and foster in society, and in particular in families, an appreciation of the benefits to be derived from education and particularly as regards the physical, intellectual, emotional, social and moral development of the child. The physical aspect is the first one mentioned but the State is failing to meet that obligation to our children which is included in the Constitution. The last facilities provided in schools are those for physical education. There would be less truancy and less dropping out at primary and second levels if there were better sports and other facilities which would be of an educational nature but also of interest to children. Educators and policies are to blame for turning children off education.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to hear 20 year old people saying that they are going back to study for the leav <Col N="118" /> ing certificate. It is some time since I taught but I meet people who left school then and who are now returning to education. This is most important. It shows that people will be interested in education if they are properly stimulated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Department's intention to resolve the problem of truancy and early school leaving, but I regret that the Bill does not make a commitment to extra financial and administrative resources to help schools design and implement effective strategies to that end. It is a pity more time is not available for this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Minister issued a press release on 28 April regarding the introduction of the Bill which lists eight objectives. I understand they are to raise the school leaving age; to establish a minimum education; to regularise school attendance; to establish an educational welfare board and officers; to set up an appeals mechanism in disciplinary cases; to provide for the exchange of data; to try to address issues of young people entering employment at too young an age; and, by keeping them at school, to break the cycle of poverty. These are laudable objectives which nobody could dispute.</P>
      <P>Children go to school at the age of four or five. At that age, they are full of enthusiasm and they love school. We must ask why, after only a few years, a small number of children become disaffected. I welcome the provision in the Bill that part of the function of the national education board which will be established will be to conduct and commission research into the reasons for truancy among students and to develop strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. It is amazing that this information was not available before the legislation was formulated.</P>
      <P>I understand figures suggest there is a 90% to 94% attendance rate at primary schools. In Cork and Waterford, where there are attendance officers, the attendance rate at second level schools is 93% and 94% respectively. What level of attendance is the Bill seeking to achieve? Are we seeking a 100% or 96% rate? What is the aim? I worked as a home-school liaison teacher before I was elected to the House and I know from experience that young people employ all means possible to skip classes when they are disaffected. The amount of ingenuity they employ is staggering. They skip full days and half days from school, but they also contrive to miss individual classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is related to the issue of training for teachers and I welcome the provisions in the Bill in that most important area. The problem of truancy may be over exaggerated, but the small level which exists involves in the main, students who are disaffected. Often teachers are unable to deal with disaffected students and the training system does not provide sufficient time to train them on how to deal with such students in the classroom when they act up, the psychology involved and how to put measures into practice. To where does <Col N="119" /> a teacher go for help if he or she has to deal with a disaffected student in the classroom?</P>
    <P>Principals are already overloaded with work. I caution the Minister against overloading the willing horse too much. He must ensure that enough resources are put into schools so the legislation can be properly administered in schools. It would be the worst possible scenario if another layer of bureaucracy was created in addition to the work principals must already do, but insufficient resources were provided to carry out the additional work.</P>
    <P>An excellent home-school-community liaison scheme is in operation throughout the country. This scheme operates on the principle of changing attitudes towards education by creating links between homes and other agencies in society. We should be careful to avoid bringing the scheme under the scope of the Bill. At present, the home-school-community liaison scheme operates on the basis of incentives. The role of the liaison person is to support and help. He or she is not seen as an authority. However, if the home-school-community liaison teacher becomes a reporting agent, the relationship between the liaison officer and the people with whom he or she is trying to work would be completely changed. I ask the Minister to ensure there is a clear line of demarcation in this area. There must be a clear distinction between the work of home-school-community liaison teachers and education welfare officers.</P>
    <P>It is important that enough resources are put into schools to help them in this area. One of the aims is to advise and assist the parents of children who exhibit problems relating to attendance at school. That is one of the functions of the board. I would be interested to know who will do that. I am happy that we will monitor and assess the effectiveness of strategies and programmes aimed at preventing truancy in recognised schools. Promoting and fostering an environment in recognised schools that encourages children to attend and participate fully in the life of the school was mentioned. We are talking about the school climate but it is aspirational and I am concerned that this is the case with much of the legislation we pass. I am interested so see how the board will do this. These are nebulous terms. How do we define school climate? What is a good or bad school, if there is such?</P>
    <P>The board must have regard to the cost. I know cost is important but it should not be an overriding preoccupation with the board. I welcome the fact that courses and syllabi will be examined to see if they lead to truancy. I am anxious that those whom we establish as education welfare officers be qualified in some way to deal with students who may be vulnerable. I know the Bill is peppered with &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; and so on but if one was dealing with a child suffering from school phobia it would be important to recognise that and not have the welfare officer demand that the child be sent back to school. There are instances where children find it extremely difficult to go to <Col N="120" /> school. We cannot force students into schools. We must look at the reasons they do not attend school. There may be very good reasons. I have had examples of students who were suicidal because they were, in their eyes, forced to attend schools and could not see any way out. They hated being there. We must be very careful. At the same time we must ensure that children receive an education. I urge that there be a balance when the board is set up. Perhaps it will look at this debate and take note of what I and other speakers said.</P>
    <P>As regards qualifications, the education welfare officers must have an understanding of what is happening in the schools and, I suggest, specialised training in dealing with people and, in particular, students who may be at risk. In some cases all that is required may be a short meeting, a bit of a chat and a little encouragement, in others more may be required but we must use minimum force in these circumstances and not go in with the heavy gang first time round.</P>
    <P>I welcome the liaison that is proposed but we need more data. Why not ask secondary schools to include the figure for absences in their databases? Most schools use computer databases and it would be easy to include the figure at the end of each term or at year end. What about a child who skips a class? Does the Bill require that we deal with that level of attendance? Sometimes a child appears in school in the morning, is registered as being present and then disappears for the day. In large schools, youngsters can get lost in the system.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill improve school attendance? We must make adequate provision for disaffected students. Support is needed for students and families and it must be given at the earliest possible opportunity. Primary school teachers and principals tell us they can recognise, at senior infants level, a child who will have difficulty. We need extra resources as early as possible at primary school level. Once a child falls behind and begins to feel inadequate in school there is a difficulty. It is very hard for the child to catch up. I know primary school teachers are looking for extra resources and I agree they should get them. I know from experience that when a student reaches second level where there are resources &ndash; remedial teachers, career guidance counsellors, home school liaison and so on &ndash; it is too late. If a child is disaffected at 12 or 13 years going on to second level it is too late. In many cases if we force that child into a classroom he or she will upset the whole class or school. We must look at what we do with a child who is disaffected, a child who does not want to be in the classroom and cannot work with teachers or other students. Do we force that child to stay in the school and be a disruption? Do we have adequate resources in case the child must be removed from the school? Surely such resources should be in place so that a child who cannot survive in school with others will have somewhere to go. I have come across instances where children in school can be physi<Col N="121" /> cally dangerous to others. What do we do then? It is a terrible worry for teachers, students and parents, including the parents of the child at risk.</P>
    <P>We must look at why children stop going to school. At what age does it happen? Does it vary between urban and rural areas? Why are some schools not attractive to some students and others are? Do schools bear part of the responsibility for school attendance? There is much research in this area. School factors come into play. What research has the Department commissioned in this area? Many issues related to school truancy can be generalised but quite often they are particular to the student and his or her situation. We must focus on the individual. I am a little concerned that we are looking at the macro level and I am more interested in looking at the student in the classroom and in the home and focusing there. We do not want to create a big brother watching over our shoulders without really helping us improve our work. We must be careful about placing an extra burden on schools, principals and boards without giving extra resources and information.</P>
    <P>I like the notion of schools linking with agencies in a given town or area. That is a good idea. In every small town a wide range of attendance should be offered but there should be agreement on discipline and liaison between schools and agencies. Up to now when a child transferred from primary to secondary school it was quite possible for him or her to fall out of the system but under this Bill that will not happen. There should be provision for a record of transfer from one school to another. However, there is a certain reluctance to do that for various reasons.</P>
    <P>Section 18 states that a parent should inform the school not later than three days after a child misses school. Very often parents are the last to know their child has missed school. How can a parent inform a school that his child is absent if he is not aware of this? The child may leave home in the morning with a bag on his or her back but may not arrive in school. The parents believe the child has gone to school and are very often shocked to discover the child has not attended school. This is an issue about which I am concerned. We cannot include in legislation a requirement for parents to inform schools that their child is not in attendance if they are not aware of this themselves. Perhaps the onus should be put on the schools to inform parents if their child is missing for more than three days, not the other way round which is not practical.</P>
    <P>We must look again at suspending and expelling students and so on. This is dealt with in the Bill but it must be clarified. I realise there are grounds for appeal but I am concerned that some of these appeal mechanisms might take a long time to put in place. Perhaps a fast track mechanism should be included in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The promotion of good behaviour is mentioned. I agree that sanctions should be put in place to promote good behaviour. Some schools have a certificate of attendance. The problem <Col N="122" /> with this method is that when attendance is broken, the certificate becomes meaningless. We must be careful about the kinds of strategies that are put in place. While it is proposed to ask parents to sign a code of conduct, there is no provision whereby the child should sign the code. It might be a good idea for the child to sign the code also. This would allow the child to take ownership of the code and to have it explained to him. The code of behaviour mentioned in section 23 should be couched in such a way that children will understand what is required of them. These are the people at whom it is being focused.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's proposal to restrict employment of young people. We must ask why young people feel a need to take up work while their studies suffer. We must provide resources for students who work. My colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, has suggested that students receive some sort of payment for attending school. Perhaps this is not a bad idea given that there are not sufficient inspectors to police the young persons employment Act.</P>
    <P>I intended speaking on disabled students and special schools. The Bill does not focus on these issues but it is important to look at the need for more physiotherapists, speech therapists and special schools. While I welcome the Bill, a number of issues need to be clarified. However, I wish it well and I will watch its operation with interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Education affects everyone at some point, usually at the early stages in their life when their attitudes and outlooks are being formed. Some people avoid the school institutions as much as possible. I speak as a person who took the other extreme and spent the vast majority of my life to date in the educational sphere. However, whether a person considers themselves academic, practical or in another category, I strongly believe that the school environment should, as far as possible, accommodate the diversity of students liable to enter its confines. The views, interests and economic situation of the parents and the school environment such as location, transport, building, staff, atmosphere, size, curriculum and so forth must combine to offer not just educational development, but also social development in a holistic manner. This is a tall order for any Minister to oversee and for anyone involved in the provision of education to provide. The Minister, Deputy Martin, looks at his departmental responsibilities in such an holistic manner. Together with his staff, he is working towards a better delivery of service that will assist in the overall welfare of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us today focuses on addressing the needs of those most at risk of suffering educational disadvantage. It is yet another important initiative the Minister has created to put in place a supportive infrastructure which will help tackle the difficulties of school attendance. This measure is the culmination of much work and its <Col N="123" /> aim is a positive step in the right direction. I commend the Minister for his attention to bringing other people's ideas on board. He has reached out to the partners in education and held seminars on the Bill. Such consultation has been part of the Minister's style since he came into office. That consultation, and taking on board the views of those closest to the coalface is definitely the manner in which to proceed if one wants to achieve a workable Bill.</P>
    <P>The right to an education is a fundamental right. As I have had many representations from the home educators, I am pleased the Minister in his speech clarified that the Bill respects the parents' rights also. He said that the Bill explicitly recognises that some parents will opt to have their children educated outside the recognised school system. The people I am familiar with have been very successful educators and are very responsible in their approach to the educational development of their children. I understand that many concerns have been raised by this section of the community in respect of their children being branded as truants and being deemed to be guilty before being proven innocent. I trust that these concerns can be addressed. I balance that statement with an understanding that there are other sections in society who may not encourage their children to have a minimum education. These students deserve the attention the Bill offers.</P>
    <P>The second objective of the Bill is to create a structure to encourage and promote attendance at school. This should have the result that, if implemented, together with continuing reforms already begun by the Minister, students will achieve the best possible chance to have a solid educational base for life. Coming from a region that has had, and continues to have, a serious problem with early school leaving, I believe that every effort should be made to ensure this trend is reversed, given the proven links between poor school attendance and disadvantage in social and economic terms in later life. In Donegal at present, particularly in Inishowen, the early school leaving level is almost unsurpassed by any other region in the country. At this point, I offer the Minister my warmest thanks for choosing Inishowen as one of the pilot zones to study early school leaving. This project can only be constructive in a region where 59% of the adult population lack basic educational qualifications. While I realise there is a level of administration involved in any pilot scheme, I trust that the Minister will expedite this issue so that we will see the programme develop on the ground as soon as possible. I welcome the support the Minister has given in the form of the pilot project for early school leaving and we all look forward to both its implementation and to learning from the issues it throws up.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the major reasons for such early school leaving, as happened in Inishowen, has now been almost eliminated. The reason was not a lack of educational ability or <Col N="124" /> aptitude but the easy access to a well paid job in the textile industry. The decline of that sector has emphasised the lack of qualifications of many of my constituents. It leaves them in a situation where they are motivated by the current situation to look at the option of returning to education. They do not need the ESRI to point out that, as the Minister of State Deputy O'Dea stated earlier, the absence of educational qualifications among many school leavers will leave them seriously at risk of spending much of their lives unemployed and that despite our economic success, these people who leave the educational system without qualifications will remain at a significant disadvantage in finding employment. It is, therefore, important to further the wishes of the ESRI that intervention programmes be put in place in the next national development plan.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to take on board the wishes of those who have lost their jobs and wish to gain further qualifications but because they have a mortgage and no employment, they have no safety net to survive as students. Their plight is too late for the current Bill given that they are now outside the school system being dealt with. However, their plight must not be ignored and I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to seriously consider, together with their Cabinet colleagues, the financial support that can be offered to those who are made redundant and wish to take up the option of second chance education. The answer cannot be to allow them to receive social welfare support until they qualify for a back-to-education allowance. This is not the answer for the people with whom I am dealing. They are used to being in employment and getting up in the morning for a purpose. They do not want to experience life without such a goal or purpose and they deserve more help.</P>
    <P>Returning to the issue at hand, while I see the Bill as a type of policing measure for attendance there are many influences which motivate people to stay within the system and many reasons others opt out, either temporarily or permanently. When we ponder the reasons we ponder the aspects of parental interest and school environment, location, transport, buildings, staff, atmosphere, curriculum and the sense of belonging which must relate to the school size. When we look to motivation we can see the obvious issues but often we ignore the people who can truly give us a picture of the main factors &ndash; the people who have opted out already. I firmly believe in the importance of talking to early school leavers, as the Joint Committee on Education and Science did recently. Given the academic manner in which we determine statistics and trends and then predict behaviour, we often miss the obvious. I would encourage the Minister to add this category to his list of people to be consulted if this has not already been done and I trust it will be an element within the pilot project on early school leaving.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, and the Minister have done a great deal in the recent past <Col N="125" /> for the people at school. The first thing a student encounters is the building itself. I am glad the Ministers, collectively, have been in a position to accelerate the building and repair programme since they came into office and this is much appreciated in my county where, while there are some beautiful new rural schools, many of the other buildings are old and in need of major repairs or replacement. I know that the level of development has placed great pressure on the building unit within the Department and I hope, should extra personnel be needed, they will be in a position to provide the necessary resources. In the main, the level of population has been maintained, even in the rural areas, and I trust that the many projects with the Department will come on stream for those who await them in the near future.</P>
    <P>The teachers in the schools are another key ingredient. While my county has some of the best teachers in the country I am disappointed that all schools do not have a full complement of full-time staff and this issue must be addressed. It is not good enough that schools and boards of management have to struggle on without a full team and are under pressure to find even temporary teachers. The high turnover of teaching staff is not constructive and it is occurring at an unacceptable level in my locality. The Minister may have to decide on incentives for such schools but without a full staff there are obvious implications for the continuity of educational provision for the student, and I hope the Minister can address this issue.</P>
    <P>The home-school liaison programme is a major success. This link between home and school is extremely important and should be expanded as much as possible as resources permit, particularly in schools which have not achieved already the status of disadvantage despite being in the same catchment as other schools with that designation which are catering for students from the same background. There is a substantial investment of time and effort from all sections involved but all those with whom I have been in contact agree that the home-school liason programme is a productive channel for interaction which has significance for all concerned, even if the time level involved is, as yet, not adequate.</P>
    <P>Similarly, for people with difficulties, whether physical or intellectual, I applaud the Minister's efforts to support integration, his efforts to help reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and his efforts in respect of the extension of the remedial service. The argument regarding how to deal with people with disabilities are diverse and the solutions are multifaceted. Many people complain that the rally drivers, which we create of teachers in the remedial service, serve many schools &ndash; I could give examples within my own area &ndash; but my comment on this is that at least we have more rally drivers now than ever before. I hope the Minister is committed to the continued development of the system of remedial teachers as opposed to that of rally drivers. However, the <Col N="126" /> pupil-teacher ratio and the number of support people within the classroom can be as important a focus.</P>
    <P>Many children fall behind the rest of the class for various reasons and this affects their attitude towards school. The fact that they are falling behind might not be a conscious but a subconscious element in absenteeism, but it will have a bearing on how they react in class and to the education system in general. The situation should be recognised and assessed early, as intervention at a later stage is so much more difficult and it takes much more of an effort to achieve success. Children who have difficulties in their early school years will get very dispirited if their situation is not noted in those early years and this will undoubtedly have a spiral effect as their self-esteem decreases and their performance worsens as they give up.</P>
    <P>That difficulty will be somewhat alleviated with the development of the national educational psychological service. Some parents used to ask me whether it was worth being diagnosed and labelled if there was no support available, while other parents pleaded that their children be assessed so that they would know just how they stood. The provision of help is slightly better than before, but I would ask the Minister to continue to look at the level of psychological and support services to which we, in Donegal, have access, given the size of the county and the history of the educational background. Some people who left school early in the past are becoming parents and they do not have the personal, as opposed to financial, resources to support their children educationally.</P>
    <P>While there will probably always be controversies in rural Ireland regarding school buses and school transport, the availability of a transport service can have a bearing on the attendance rate of a child. Some children of a family of which I am aware are asthmatic and have to walk past a lime quarry to the point where the bus picks them up. This aggravates their illness and all possible attempts to alter the route to accommodate them have failed. There is a great need for a realistic and commonsense approach to transport issues. At present the regulations tend to leave no room for discretion. This can lead to other foolish situations where buses cannot take alternative routes which would appear &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; to make sense and accommodate better the needs of more pupils but may involve lengthening the journey by a fraction of a mile. Linked to the need for transport is the fact that we try to assist integration. There are other issues regarding the 15 mile rule which I want to see the Minister address and I want to see him addressing the punt-sterling situation, where parents are losing 15% and not receiving much positive benefit as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister's efforts regarding the provision of computers in the primary schools are worthwhile. The curriculum and activities in school should have a bearing on life. Training in com<Col N="127" /> puters is realistic in its aim and even the youngest children can gain a sense that this is the way forward. I trust that substantial support will be given to ensure that when children leave primary school with their initial knowledge of computers they will be in a position to be able to expand this knowledge throughout their secondary schooling. This has resourcing implications but it is a natural progression.</P>
    <P>A difficulty within schools which ultimately has an impact on the students is that the teachers, particularly the principals, are becoming more like administrators every day. I hope the Minister will provide money to put in place resources necessary to implement the Bill in this regard.</P>
    <P>As the legislation raises the school leaving age from 15 to 16, I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, when he said that &ldquo;it is not simply the period of time which is spent in the education system that determines life chances&rdquo;, although there were exceptions when many people reached great heights with few qualifications. In the current climate it is advisable to have some solid foundations. In this respect I welcome the fact that raising the age limit is presented in a constructive and innovative manner.</P>
    <P>Given the Donegal experience, I commend the Minister for his aspirations regarding the second chance educational experience which he aims to offer for those between the ages of 16 to 18. I trust that the scheme will be allocated the resources to make it worthwhile. The Minister's track record indicates that he can move forward on most issues to which he sets his mind. I am sure he has a strong grasp of the multifaceted nature of the problem and the solutions that are needed. No doubt he does not see this as the be all and end all of the situation. That he has put in place pilot programmes regarding the early school leaving issue outlines that the Bill is not the end of a process but yet another step on the road to giving our younger generation a better start in life, both socially and educationally. I look forward to the continuing development of the Bill and to teasing out the issues at the Select Committee of Education and Science, of which I am a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keaveney for her constructive remarks and all the Deputies who contributed to the debate. We have listened carefully to all their comments. They have, as always, been very helpful and the Minister and I will take their comments into account as the Bill continues its progress through the House. I take this opportunity to address some of the points raised by Deputies during the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that many Members raised questions regarding the provisions in the Bill as they affect home educators. This is a very serious issue for many parents who wish to educate their children outside the State-funded system either in <Col N="128" /> their own homes or through other forms of education. I appreciate and understand that.</P>
    <P>The rationale for dealing with this issue is very straightforward. On the one hand we recognise the valuable work which many parents do in educating their children at home. Somebody suggested that many politicians regard these people as cranks or people who want to be awkward, but we do not look at them in this way. I further recognise the immense commitment and effort these parents put into this area, reflecting not only their deep commitment to the education of their children but also their desire that their children should receive a proper education. I know that many children benefit enormously from this rich and rewarding method of education.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution recognises such home education as being worthwhile and deserving of fundamental protections. It is not our intention in this Bill to halt or impede this education. Our concern instead is simply to ensure that children who are being educated in this environment achieve a minimum education. We owe that to these children. This is a sensitive area. Officials of the Department of Education and Science have been in discussions with home educators to consider how we might meet their concerns without diluting the fundamental principle of a child's entitlement to a minimum education. In doing this, we will endeavour to attain the happy medium to which Deputy Dennehy referred. I hope that further progress can be made on this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton suggested that the Bill will not be able to meet the needs of schools adequately because the structure it will establish is too centralised and not capable of meeting needs at a local level. I emphatically reject that criticism. The Bill has been specifically designed to tackle the issues of absenteesim through a partnership between schools as the central actors, supported by the education welfare officer locally, and the National Educational Welfare Board nationally. The Bill will further provide a dedicated mechanism in the form of a liaison committee to allow the statutory agencies working in this area to co-ordinate their efforts, both at national and at local level. This will provide for an effective dedication of resources to those areas most in need.</P>
    <P>Deputies Hayes and Clune referred to the necessity for the membership of the National Educational Welfare Board to be representative of the partners in education. As I said when introducing the Bill, it is the Minster's intention that all members of the board should have a deep insight into, and awareness of, the education system. Having listened to the views expressed by the Deputies and Members of the Upper House, the Minister will consider this issue between now and Committee Stage with a view to introducing an appropriate amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane inquired how the Bill will provide for the needs of children with special educational needs. This is a crucial issue and I am glad to have the opportunity to refer to it briefly. <Col N="129" /> I want to make it quite clear to the Deputy that we have already, in the Education Act, 1998 put in place the statutory structure to safeguard the rights of these children. Section 7 of the Education Act places an obligation on the Minister to make available to each person in the State, including a person with special educational needs, a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs of that person.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, including Deputy Higgins and Deputy Naughten, referred to the other needs of the education system and stressed the importance of measures to tackle disadvantage, learning difficulties, and adult illiteracy. I assure them that our commitments to these and other areas of need remain unchanged. We do not see the enactment of the legislation as some form of trade-off against other needs in the education system. Our actions in these areas will continue unabated.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned with in the Bill is to create a structure now which will ensure that the problem of early school leaving will be tackled effectively and immediately in order to prevent future generations growing up without the education necessary for their personal and social development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten questioned the decision to raise the school leaving age only to 16 and asked why it is not being raised to 17 or even 18. I will set out the rationale for this proposal. First, we are not proposing simply a one year raising of the school leaving age. Rather, we are proposing that the increased age be accompanied by a move to ensure that all young persons leaving school at the age of 16 should first have completed at least three years' junior cycle education. What we are doing, therefore, is changing the focus from an emphasis on the time spent in education to an emphasis on the level of education achieved during that time. This is a very significant proposal, the importance of which it is impossible to under-estimate. For the first time ever we are asking not how long a person spends in school but rather what that person gains from his or her time at school.</P>
    <P>Second, we are not proposing to raise the school leaving age more than one year at present because we feel we should not move too quickly nor be too prescriptive on this matter. Rather, we should take this one step at a time. We should also remember that at the age of 18, compulsion can have very little effect in keeping young people at school. What we should be trying to do instead is to persuade young people of the importance of an education and to support them in their choices by making education services available to them, both inside and outside the formal education system. Only in this way can we expect to get a real return from the education services provided.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that many Members agree with the proposals to provide some education and training for young people who leave school after the minimum school leaving age but before the age of 18. As indicated earlier, I am considering <Col N="130" /> some changes to these. Our basic aim remains, as in all things educational, to help these young people to obtain the maximum benefit from education.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to repeat the key principle underpinning all aspects of the Bill, namely, the educational welfare of children and young people progressing through the education system at first and second level. The Bill is not about sanctions for truancy &ndash; although they may, in a small number of cases, be unavoidable &ndash; rather it is concerned with securing the educational welfare of children and young people in the education system. Viewed from this standpoint, the Bill is just one element &ndash; albeit it a key element &ndash; in the network of supports for the education system, in particular those interventions designed to tackle absenteeism and early school leaving, which the Government introduced since coming to office two and a half years ago.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my remarks at the commencement of the debate regarding the importance of consultation in the development of legislation in the area of school attendance. Deputies Cooper-Flynn, Collins and others referred to the extensive consultation process undertaken by my Department. Both the Minister and I are convinced of the importance of consultation, of taking account of the views of the experts &ndash; including the members of this House who I recognise as having a great deal of practical experience and, in some case, professional expertise &ndash; when developing policy in any area. Consultation is particularly important in the area of education. The Minister and I have laid special emphasis on consulting the partners on every educational policy development since the Government entered office and we propose to continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Members who contributed to the debate. I look forward to a further constructive debate on this matter as it proceeds through other Stages.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This consolidation Bill has been referred to the draftsman's office and certified by the Attorney General's office as not involving a change in law.

Issues of a policy nature do not arise from this Bill and, consequently, I do not intend to spend too long on it.</P>
      <P>In his speech last night the Minister kindly gave a full review of the imposition of stamp duty under statute, from the time it was first introduced as a temporary measure in 1774, 225 years ago, when 47 different types of document were subject to stamp duty, right up to the introduction of this Bill to consolidate extant stamp duty law.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that it was introduced as a temporary measure 225 years ago. In the early days of this century, income tax was also introduced as a temporary measure. It seems many taxes are introduced as a temporary expedient and then become a permanent fixture in financial legislation. I presume it was a coincidence that it was introduced the year before the American War of Independence. Perhaps it had something to do with funding the imperial war against the rebels in the United States which everyone knew was going to occur by mid-1774.</P>
      <P>The main legislation in Ireland dates from two key Acts of 1891. It is curious that while there have been modifications in the law affecting stamp duty since then, many of the amendments have been introduced by way of individual Finance Acts, rather than through amendments to stamp duty. The main extension took place in 1981 when the Finance Act imposed a levy on credit cards and charge cards. Around that time stamp duty on transactions was introduced for the first time.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that information technology obliges the Revenue Commissioners to adapt themselves. I welcome the modernisation of the stamps themselves, in their design and through the use of holograms, as signalled in the Minister's speech. I welcome the fact that in the process which led to the drafting of this Act, great pains were taken to consult all expert interested parties, from the Institute of Taxation to the Incorporated Law Society. Two referees were appointed to ensure nothing extraneous was included in the legislation by mistake. The procedures adopted in the Tax Consolidation Bill were appropriate and effective and I am glad to see them being adopted here also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only one policy related item to raise &ndash; the incidence of stamp duty as it applies to residential property. It is set out clearly in the Schedule. This is not an appropriate vehicle for introd<Col N="132" /> ucing change but the Minister might have a look at the incidence of stamp duty on residential property in his budget.</P>
    <P>Many people are under the illusion that the first £60,000 of value of a residence is exempt from stamp duty. That is not the position. A residence, including its contents up to £60,000, is exempt from stamp duty, but once the value of a residence and its contents exceeds £60,000, like a number of other taxes and levies, the stamp duty applies from the first pound. In any residence worth up to £100,000, stamp duty applies at 3% from the first pound. Even in my city it is difficult to find a residence which would be valued at less than £60,000. One would search long and hard in Dublin before one could avail of the stamp duty exemption on a residence of less than £60,000.</P>
    <P>As in inheritance tax, and capital acquisitions tax as a whole, this exemption limit has been made redundant by the huge increases in property prices, including residential property prices. I call on the Minister for Finance to review this exemption limit. As a first step, he might change it to say that the first £60,000 of any residential property will be exempt from stamp duty. That would be a welcome step. It would give the boost that many young people buying second hand homes need. Then, if a starter home cost in the region of £140,000, they would be satisfied that the first £60,000 would be exempt from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made now that the whole schedule of percentages applying to residential properties should be reviewed. The Minister for Finance should consider this when he introduces his budget on 1 December and put such a review into effect when the Finance Bill is brought before the House in the spring.</P>
    <P>I compliment all those involved in the Bill. There are other items of a technical or policy nature which I intend to raise on Committee Stage but the Fine Gael Party is happy to agree with the Bill and give it a free run through the House. We will not delay it on Committee Stage either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the effort of the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary draftsmen in putting this Bill together in such a simple and accessible format. I congratulate the Revenue Commissioners on the extensive work they have done in tidying up the whole area of stamp duty. They did the same in the Taxes Consolidation Act two years ago. It shows that we have experts working in that area and I applaud them.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have stated that they will provide extensive guidance notes on this Bill. The Revenue Commissioners have the best of all Government websites and I am sure those notes and the Bill will form part of that informative website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consolidation of stamp duty legislation is a boon for the tax practitioners and solicitors who use it. It is great that the archaic language which has been part of stamp duty Acts in the past has <Col N="133" /> been modernised. The Institute of Taxation has nothing but praise for the work which has been done by the Revenue Commissioners on this matter.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan said, this is not the time to change stamp duty, but it is time to flag changes which might be welcome in future. I would like to see the question of stamp duty on the incorporation of a business addressed so an interest in a business could succeed from parent to child and the child could be given a degree of ownership. If that could be done without a levy of 1% on the assets, it would be very valuable.</P>
    <P>In Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Finland and Spain there is 0% stamp duty on the transfer of shares. In Britain the rate is only 0.5% and that may be abolished. By doing away with the 1% charge on share transfers, it would allow for a better rate of transfer and would open up the market for shares.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Carers for People with Disability: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on Tuesday, November 16 1999:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;noting that there are an estimated 100,000 carers who provide the bulk of care for people with severe disabilities, those who are mentally ill, those suffering from chronic illnesses or those who are in need of care through age or infirmity, most of whom are in receipt of no financial assistance and whose role is not recognised, acknowledged or supported by the State;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;conscious of the fact that an estimated 140,000 people with physical and sensory disability have yet to achieve full, social,economic and educational integration as equal, independent and participative members within the general community;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;aware from Government-commissioned reports that more than 1,000 people with intellectual disability live in completely inappropriate surroundings and that thousands more are on waiting lists for essential services, such as residential and respite care;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;believing that there is an urgent need to address the legitimate demands of people with a disability, their families, carers and advocates for a range of appropriate services and supports;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;knowing that the present healthy state of the economy provides an unpre<Col N="134" /> cedented opportunity to vindicate the rights of and radically improve the quality of life for people with disabilities, the elderly, the chronically ill and for their carers and families; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;recognising the justifiable anger and disappointment of carers, people with disabilities, their families and advocates because of the failure of the Government to comprehensively provide for their documented needs and entitlements which has led, for the second successive year, to their public protest at the gates of Leinster House,</P>
    <P Just="Center">calls on the Government to put in place a comprehensive financial package in the millennium budget to fund the necessary expansion of both community-based and residential care facilities, services and requirements and, in particular, to provide for:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;full implementation, by the end of 2000, of the recommendations contained in the report &lsquo;Towards an Independent Future';</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the elimination of waiting lists for respite, residential and day care and for essential aids and appliances;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the expansion of the personal assistance service to allow for a substantial increase in the number of adequately paid and trained personal assistants;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;a radical overhaul of financial supports to carers and people with disabilities, including an increase in the carer's allowance to not less than £100 per week and a relaxation of the present stringent means test requirements, which addresses the need for a non-means-tested cost-of-care allowance and cost-of-disability allowance;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the extension of the incapacitated persons' tax allowance;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the payment of domiciliary care allowance from date of definite diagnosis rather than from two years of age, as at present;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the establishment of home-help services as a core health service provided as a statutory entitlement with an increased number of adequately paid and trained personnel;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;a substantial increase in the number of public health nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers and other paramedical services,</P>
    <P Just="Center">and demands that the Government produce a fully-costed programme to achieve these objectives and to undertake to fulfil the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the <Col N="135" /> Status of People with Disabilities within a specified timeframe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services to people with disabilities, their families and carers and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in meeting these commitments, which include the provision of additional funding of £91.662 million, the putting in place of arrangements to meet the educational needs of children with special needs and the enhancement of the Carers' Allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Minister for Health and Children)</P>
    <P>Ms O'Sullivan: I wish to share my time with Deputy Penrose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appalling that people with disabilities must campaign outside this House to obtain the basic rights and facilities they need to fully participate in society. In this era of the Celtic tiger it should not be accepted that such people must protest outside here. All citizens should have basic rights for which funding is automatically provided. People who seek basic rights such as getting up in the morning, having appropriate aids and appliances and going to work should not have to jockey with other lobby groups prior to the budget.</P>
      <P>People with disabilities should have the necessary resources to take part in the life of their communities and that should be the basis for any decent society. Our economy is such that services of the highest standard should be provided to these people. Ireland no longer has a developing economy and this should be recognised by fulfilling the basic needs of people with disabilities, those suffering from long-term illness and those who provide back up services to them. My colleague, Deputy Penrose, will deal with the carer's issue while I will concentrate on people with disabilities. However, the two issues are interwoven and it is important that both are addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funds and information on what exactly was needed to solve the problem for this group of people may have been in short supply in the past but that is no longer the case. We are aware of what is required to bring these, our fellow citizens, a quality of life which is their entitlement. They should not have to lobby year after year and become part of the loudest voice syndrome to get the attention of the Minister for Finance. A fundamental change of approach is needed which <Col N="136" /> separates what is essential in an egalitarian society and provides for it without any need for people to apply pressure. It is our duty, as legislators, to make sure that happens.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists for respite, residential and day care, essential aids and appliances, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, home helps and other support services need to be eliminated. No person should be left in a position whereby he or she cannot get out of bed, have breakfast, wash, go to school, training or work because he or she does not have the appropriate personal assistance that is required and those who supply these services should not be paid less than the proposed minimum wage. Recently I was in the Irish Wheelchair Association centre in Limerick and I met a woman who is paid £3 per hour to provide essential personal assistance to people who are wheelchair-bound. She not only accepts this abysmal wage but puts in extra hours because she is so outraged. We should share that outrage and use it to bring about fundamental changes in the provision of resources to meet basic needs.</P>
    <P>The demands in the pre-budget submissions of the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Centre for Independent Living, the Carers Association, the National Association of Mental Handicap in Ireland and various other groups representing people with disabilities do not come from a wish list to which no rationale has been applied. Their demands are based on the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and from the experience of such people. Their basic needs must be satisfied. In particular, I call on the Minister to provide personal assistance for those who need it.</P>
    <P>This week the Limerick Centre for Independent Living closed because its funds ran out. I am calling for an urgent response to this crisis, which is an example of the need to provide a secure independent living fund, which has been proposed in the pre-budget submissions of a number of organisations. Disabled citizens should have basic rights similar to the rest of us in society and they must be provided for in the budget given that money is available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate and I unequivocally support the thrust of the motion. I strongly call for a fair deal for the carers who save the State hundreds of millions of pounds annually in nursing home fees and subvention. Every Member is aware of the extent of the sacrifice which many carers make in terms of their own careers and ambitions in order to attend to the needs of sick or dependent loved ones. However, it cannot be taken for granted anymore. The State must recognise and take account of the huge savings that accrue to the health budget because family members are prepared to provide full-time care for their elders. These savings should be calculated and channelled back into resources and support for carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything that carers seek appears to the Carers Association to be eventually, if at all, grudgingly conceded. The Government often must be dragged screaming to agree to reasonable sugges<Col N="137" /> tions that would improve the lot of carers but most concessions in the recent past were meagre in anybody's objective view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was much more than the Labour Party provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not worry about that. I ask the Minister to ensure that he obtains a reasonable share of the forthcoming budget. The maximum level of the carer's allowance is only £76.50 and it is rigorously means tested. There are approximately 100,000 carers in Ireland who do an important job for society, yet only 15,000 of those who look after elderly family members at home qualify for the allowance and one seventh do not even qualify for the full measly allowance.</P>
      <P>It costs between £400 and £500 per week to care for an elderly person in a nursing home. It would be better to ensure that people care for their parents or other relatives in their own home environment, which would be preferable from all points of view, but the only way to ensure that this happens is to remove the means test which was introduced with the sole motive of reducing the number eligible to receive the carer's allowance. I am delighted that our party finance spokesperson, Deputy McDowell, called for the abolition of the means test last week. In this time of plenty, it is the least that can be done because then those who do the important job of caring for an elderly relative suffering from Alzheimer's disease or senile dementia will qualify for the allowance without being subject to a niggardly, begrudging means test.</P>
      <P>Approximately 80% of carers are women, many of whom are married. They are treated as dependants of their husbands when they are means tested. This is an outdated concept and is insulting to women. It treats them as non-persons. They are treated as dependants in many aspects of the social welfare code. It is time to stop this nonsense. They should be treated as individuals in their own right and not be subject to their husband's status in terms of income. Why is a social assistance payment classified as income and, therefore, subject to income tax? A carer must virtually work around the clock every day in order to receive £76.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad the Minister made a positive change in regard to disregarding the allowance in medical card reviews and I hope that all health boards take note. However, very often if one is in receipt of the allowance, one's rent allowance or supplementary welfare allowance for special diets and eating is stopped because they are considered as income by the health board. These anomalies should be rectified immediately given the money that is available. The Carers Association recently raised an issue, in which I am sure the Minister of State, who is a medical doctor, would be interested, regarding medical assessors in the Department who appear to insist that carers must be available 24 hours a day every day. They require something which is virtually impossible to provide. Why do they often decide to cut off the carer's allowance despite the provision of the cer<Col N="138" /> tification of physician by the family doctor? Imagine saying to the carers who work hard for so little that they are not entitled to this allowance. The method of assessment should be reformed immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. In recent weeks I have had the opportunity, like my constituency colleagues, to hear the case being made by people from the Centre for Independent Living in Laois and Offaly and from the Carers' Association. Each year many groups make representations and submissions to Government and particularly in the lead up to the budget. This year, our best year of economic growth, many voluntary groups have come together to promote the need for increased State funding for people with disabilities and for those who care for them on a daily basis. In the present economic climate there is a belief that we must do more to improve the lot of people with disabilities and their carers.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, also believes this. Last night in the House he confirmed that the Government fully supports the principle that people with disabilities are entitled to all the rights and privileges which go with citizenship and that all obstacles that prevent their enjoyment of such rights should be removed. The Government's commitment to developing services for people with disabilities has been demonstrated by the investment of more than £91 million over the past two and half years. Some £21.5 million has already been identified for the services in the Estimates for 2000 with further additional funding in the forthcoming budget. We all recognise that more must be done.</P>
      <P>One practical way to ensure people with disabilities enjoy all rights and privileges is to provide adequate funding to health boards to support the case made by the Centre for Independent Living. The centre seeks to enable people with disabilities to enhance their quality of life, to achieve independent living and participate in social and economic life.  Adequate State support for independent living would go a long way towards helping those with disabilities to participate fully in all of life's appointments. Also the case made on behalf of carers is a practical one. In recent weeks I have listened to the case made by them. I recognise their commitment and the growing feeling that the work of the carer is not fully recognised. I urge the Minister, before the budget, to relax the means test. The main issue discussed at the meeting in Laois was the need to relax that test. That only 1,400 out of 14,000 carers are in receipt of the full allowance shows the need for an immediate review. We should be mindful that carers save the State by keeping people out of institutional care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the move towards a partnership between the voluntary and the statutory sectors, <Col N="139" /> a point made by the Minister last night. For too long we left the provision of services for people with disabilities in the hands of voluntary groups. The 1990s saw some change in this regard by way of a gradual involvement by the State in providing services. I welcome the recommendation in the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities for the establishment in each health board of a co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. The functions of the committees include the planning and co-ordination of the services and advising the health boards on priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services. As a member of the health board I am pleased to note that such committees are in place.</P>
    <P>In his contribution last night, the Minister showed his understanding of the problems in this area and his commitment and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, has been demonstrated over the past year. It is important to realise that dealing with the area of disabilities is not just about throwing money at it. It is important to identify the real needs. This is being taken on board with the establishment of the National Disability Authority. Relatively small amounts can make a huge difference. I support the Minister's commitment, and that of the Government, in recognising the need to provide funding to ensure people with disabilities have all the facilities to enable them become involved in ordinary life. I hope that in the next two weeks the case made by Government backbenchers and Opposition Deputies will be taken on board to recognise that the Celtic tiger has reason to roam in the area of people with disabilities. I support the Minister's position on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak in support of the Minister's approach to this motion. I cannot overstate the importance of the carer in the Ireland of today. We are all basking in the glow of a boom economy with its attendant social welfare and health improvements. One of the spin-offs from these benefits is that more people are living longer and they will need to be cared for as they age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, has established certain priorities regarding the care of older people and those with disabilities. It encourages the care of elderly and disabled people within their own communities. It aims to provide the best of hospital and residential care for those who cannot eventually be cared for in their own homes. It wishes to ensure that all health and social services are responsive to the particular needs of those people. It is committed to ensuring, when at all possible, that the elderly and disabled are assisted to achieve the concept of independent living. It intends to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and to overhaul the relevant income support systems. The Government will provide adequate resources for national respite care. We have already laid down the following specific key priorities for carers: an increase <Col N="140" /> in the value of the carer's allowance in real terms, a new tax allowance for those who care for older and disabled people and a relaxation in the qualifying criteria. Only last week we spoke about that again at the parliamentary party meeting and, it is to be hoped, something will be done about it in the budget.</P>
    <P>Those being cared for should be enabled to maintain their personal dignity and their living standards in their own homes. There have been many improvements in the field of caring in the short time since the Government took office. Almost £39 million has been provided since 1997. A package worth £16 million was allocated to improving the lot of carers in the 1998 budget and the means test was amended to allow carers an additional £75 in their income allowance. Certain carers can avail of free travel passes; the free telephone allowance is extended to all in receipt of the carer's allowance; a payment of £200 per annum to carers as a contribution towards respite care has also been awarded and residency conditions have been relaxed as have the full time care and attention stipulations. This will allow carers to work part time for up to ten hours per week. Another aspect of caring that is formally protected under new regulations guarantees the preservation of carers' social insurance records when they move directly to caring from insurable employment. This, and the measures already listed, compare more than favourably with the legislative performance of some of the signatories of the motion while they were in office. They enacted little that would show they cared for the carers.</P>
    <P>The State's role in community care is one of support and encouragement. This is public policy since 1968 when it was outlined in a policy document entitled, Care of the Aged. The objective of this report embodied the concept of keeping older people in their own homes. It addressed the need for adequate support for those requiring institutional care and laid strong emphasis on the need for supporting carers in the area of the great emotional and physical stress caused by long-term caring.</P>
    <P>There are family carers who undertake the responsibility of caring for children with physical and serious disabilities. They are sometimes newly married couples who can handle the physical care and needs of a young disabled child. A decade down the line the carers face a different scenario. Their cares are ten years older and they themselves have aged. They face an increasingly difficult situation as their children grow older, bigger and heavier. I know an elderly lady in my constituency who cares for a disabled son in his late forties who is over 15 stone in weight. She has to tend to his every need. When there is no one else to help, she has to lift him in and out of the bath. This scene is repeated on a wide scale throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The work of a carer is one of selfless dedication. It deserves to be recognised. This view is shared by all Members of the House. Evidence of concern on this side of the Chamber can be seen in the review of the carer's allowance issued in October 1998. It recognises the central role <Col N="141" /> played by carers in &ldquo;creating a community of caring&rdquo;. It emphasises the need to provide practical help to the carer in the many facets of the carer's duties, such as domestic help, home adaptation appliances, incontinence services and transport. It outlines their rights to a back-up service from public health nurses, day care centres and home helpers.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that carers have an input into planning and care policies as they are the ones with the practical knowledge and the on-the-job experience. Let it be understood that the Government is committed to ensuring that carers will continue to be given every possible recognition and to be shown our deep appreciation. The current improvements in the field of care speak for themselves. I ask the House to fully support the Minister and the amendment to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I acknowledge the increased funding directed over the past two and a half years to the overall area of disability. It must be accepted as a move in the right direction. However, much more needs to be done and much more finance from the Government is needed to make things happen.</P>
      <P>In the forthcoming budget I hope all spending in this area will be substantially increased, but I also hope the Government will ensure we get value for money from every health board and that it insists each board is more open and works with the various agencies representing the disability sector to achieve a much more customer focused response. The clearing house concept would help to deal with many of these issues and should be adopted by every board.</P>
      <P>Supporting the personal development of each disabled person and ensuring they are given every opportunity to take their place in society, play a full role and improve their quality of life to the best possible level must be the goal of any caring society. Indeed, the measure of a mature society is how well it looks after its most vulnerable members. We have some way to make up in this regard and I do not believe we can overspend in trying to achieve this.</P>
      <P>The bureaucracy of the health boards also needs to be examined as too much money is spent on its way down to county and local community levels. Projects need to be carefully monitored and health boards need to be much more open in terms of consultation and proactive in how they interact with local groups, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association. In some cases the boards behave in a protective and defensive manner when discussing funding projects, which are mainly driven by the sector representing the disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Co-ordinating committees are in place in some areas, but in some cases there is no real partnership approach from the health boards. A ministerial review of the operation of co-ordinating committees needs to be undertaken as a matter of urgency. There is an argument in favour of handing the service provided by some community care activities to the county councils, in a similar manner to the model operating in the UK, because the councils deal with social gains and <Col N="142" /> people's lives on a daily basis and are much closer to the problems.</P>
    <P>Community employment schemes have been good to services such as personal assistants, home help and home care attendants. They could play a far more significant role in the pure personal assistant scheme. I understand that, at a national level, over 400 CE workers participate in these schemes. There is a need to bring more permanency into their positions and to extend the schemes to more disabled people so that they can enjoy a fuller life and a quality of life hitherto denied to them.</P>
    <P>Given the review of the CE schemes and the cost of training these workers, I suggest a permanent squad of skilled personal assistants, supported through the CE schemes but ring-fenced. It should be established and expanded as soon as possible. The positive impact these schemes are having on the lives of people is too great to ignore.</P>
    <P>Resource and respite centres have proven to be a huge success but need to be expanded. A clear indication needs to be given them on the question of how their future funding will apply. They are now part and parcel of local community life and a lifeline to the disabled and many other sectors. The figures from the Irish Wheelchair Association show that to resource these services the following extra finance is needed: day resources, £4 million; intensive respite, £3.7 million and care attendant and personal assistants, £8.1 million.</P>
    <P>I am appalled to learn that the South-Eastern Health Board has not put in place the home care attendance scheme for which it received funding in the middle of this year. This inaction would appear to be typical of many health boards who, in fairness to them, are snowed under with new work, new concepts and new ways but have inadequate staff. I appeal to the board to deliver this scheme at the earliest possible date and to take account of the huge demand that exists in the local and regional community for such a scheme.</P>
    <P>The area of taxation for those with disablement lucky enough to be employed should be reviewed to ensure that they are not penalised to such an extent that they lose their benefits. The passport for life concept would get over this. We should encourage rather than take from these people.</P>
    <P>VAT is also an issue. The Irish Wheelchair Association residential, respite and resource centre in Kilkenny city cost £960,000. The Department gave a grant of £520,000 and the South-Eastern Health Board grant was £220,000. This left a shortfall of £220,000 to be collected by the association. The VAT content of the project was £106,666, an enormous sum. To give £520,000 and take back £106,666 is surely not the proper way to deal with such a project, which is driven at local community level. There must be a way around this problem. I appeal to the Minister to examine the finer points of the questions I have raised.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in this issue and am delighted Members have been given this brief opportunity to contribute to what is happening and what should be happening. I congratulate the Minster for Health and Children, <Col N="143" /> the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, and other Ministers for their interest in addressing the needs of what is a very vulnerable and often neglected and ignored section of our community. While acknowledging the needs that exist, in these Ministers especially we have people whose goal is to improve the lot of carers or those with a disability.</P>
      <P>In Inishowen and in County Donegal generally many groups are working to a common objective across a wide range of disability. Given the size of the geographical area concerned, I made the point to the health board covering my area that, despite this range of activity, there is a lack of co-ordination with the result that some people are falling between two stools. I am glad to say that further to this representation, it was decided that there would be a co-ordinator appointed to Inishowen and this has proven to be very satisfactory for those whom I have subsequently contacted.</P>
      <P>Often in rural areas such as mine it is the feeling of isolation that can be the biggest difficulty, especially for the carers. As groups have developed this feeling has declined only slightly. Nevertheless, as facilities have also developed, the concept of the integration of the able bodied and disabled has simultaneously advanced. The work of the Moville mental health group has, with the support of various agencies and Departments, been in a position to develop what is now called Serenity House. This facility is a resource for the town for many different functions and it runs programmes that will assist those who, in the terminology in use, would be labelled as &ldquo;socially excluded&rdquo; but whom I prefer to see as assisting the general community in their social development. I trust the future plans of Serenity House will gain the support they so badly need as the input of the voluntary sector, in its backing of this and many other similar programmes, could not be evaluated in monetary terms.</P>
      <P>Many challenges face those who care for young children with disabilities. In the past information as to what a parent was entitled to was not as forthcoming as it should have been and even in my rather recent political career I have been surprised to find that parents are only now being told if they had applied for a domicillary care allowance they would have been entitled to it. However, as they were not aware of it, the rest of the family had endured much hardship to survive without what would have been an essential boost to a low income. This should not happen in the information age and people should not have to battle to secure their just entitlements.</P>
      <P>In terms of access to schools, a tremendous effort is rightly being made to give young disabled people the opportunity to participate in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a basic human right. However, there are still terrible problems for people who live in rural Ireland. This week I came across a person who had transport made available to them by the Department only for it to be withdrawn within a <Col N="144" /> week. The alternative offered to them was a £750 grant to be paid at the end of the year to contribute to their transport. Without giving away details of the case, the person came from a remote area and the family income is small. When they inquired how much a taxi would cost they were informed it would be £35 a day. Even if the grant were extended on hardship grounds, which would be 50p a mile and for which the family would qualify, two issues remain. The circumstances of the person involved would not lend themselves to paying the balancing cost and there is no way they would be able to take out a loan to pay the taxi until such time as the retrospective grant was paid. This is only one example of an issue that should be addressed.</P>
    <P>Many positive advancements have been flagged by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin. There are those who see the current situation as insufficient, and I agree. However, a meaningful effort is being made and this is reflected throughout schools whether they cater for individual disabilities or on a larger scale, such as Scoil Íosagáin in Buncrana. There was an appalling lack of recognition on the part of the previous Government of the needs of these schools. For those people with disabilities above school age, there has been a lack of imagination and creativity at a high level. This is changing due in large part to the challenge from the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children was recently in a position to give a most welcome helping hand to the Cashel na Cor development in Buncrana. For months this group has worked quietly and tirelessly to buy a property it wishes to convert into a training unit for those beyond school age. Its vision for what Cashel na Cor will become is progressive and a pilot project for the Inishowen region. I am glad to say that all partners in the community, be they carers, parents, friends or funding agency representatives, are collaborating on this programme which will be a true challenge to deliver and maintain. However, all those involved have already proven their mettle and endurance and I wish them well in completing the project.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the staff of the James Connolly Hospital in Carndonagh and the friends of the hospital continually progress the lot of those who enter the establishment. Hospitals of this type were in the past synonymous with the old attitude to those with challenging behaviour. As the Minister for Health and Children saw on his recent visit to the area, this hospital is a true example of a caring environment with a staff that is extremely forward looking. The move towards giving each person as much of a sense of individuality and independence as possible is contrary to the type of approach that would have been adopted a number of years ago. This establishment has many plans to improve the quality of life for those in its care. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, was impressed with that work and I am confident this is the type of project that should <Col N="145" /> and will be given support within the life of the new plan.</P>
    <P>For many adults who live in their own community, their independence is vital. It is no reflection on FÁS, which does great work, to say that it is not the answer for people who need personal care assistants. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, has not only spent much time on the matter but also understands the issues involved, and I trust she will be in a position to advance the case being made. Neither is FÁS the answer for the elderly, and I look forward to the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, advancing the Alzheimer's unit for Carndonagh in County Donegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Ministers of State at the Department of Health and Children for their work. The recently published National Development Plan displays their commitment to the issue under discussion. There is a welcome capital investment of £2 billion in the health services.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that, in 1999, I should be debating the issue of facilities in public buildings, especially modern ones. I would have hoped that we would have learned from past mistakes. There should be a designated officer in every public building to deal with these issues. Complaints have been made about facilities. I am amazed that those who build public buildings do not provide enough space in toilets provided for the disabled. This is a complaint I have heard from the disabled about the new county hall in Galway.</P>
      <P>The most important point made to me by the disabled is about the independent living fund. If we could achieve this, we would be in line with many European countries and would avoid institutional care for many people. Given the role of FÁS in this area, a change in community employment schemes would be helpful. At present, an applicant for a FÁS scheme must wait six to 12 months, depending on the type of benefit or assistance they receive, before being allowed onto a community employment scheme. I favour a change in that regulation to allow people on to these schemes once they sign on for unemployment assistance. Another suggestion is to allow people to work on community employment projects where they have reared their families and they are not on the live register but are available to work as care assistants.</P>
      <P>People who work as personal assistants to the disabled often have to work unsocial hours so it does not usually attract a great percentage of participants. We should use our imagination to find ways to ensure more people participate. One disabled person told me that, to leave his home at 9 a.m., he would need a personal assistant to be at his house at 7 a.m. and this would have to be done five mornings per week. Additional training money should be provided in those situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the many changes he has made to the <Col N="146" /> carer's allowance. Some 21 improvements have been made since he took office. As the Government has effectively abolished the means test for private nursing homes, it should move towards removing the means test for the carer's allowance and have a level playing field between the two schemes. For many years I have thought that the carer's scheme should be in the Department of Health and Children. Many more carers of the disabled should receive the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>One of the major issues for carers, especially for parents of disabled children, is providing housing in local communities for young disabled people. Parents are concerned for the care of their disabled children and there is a fear as to what will happen to the children after the parents die. They are anxious that their children will not be put into institutional care. I hope local housing is one of the areas the Minister and the Ministers of State would examine.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are providing more money for respite, residential and day care. We must ensure those services are provided as near as possible to families. It has been acknowledged by voluntary groups that progress has been made. For example, many of the services for east Galway are provided in Galway city whereas, in the past, they were provided in Swinford, County Mayo. Many disabled people have spoken to me about the cost of transport to various centres. For wheelchairs, taxis might be the only option and those are very costly.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Western Health Board, the Brothers of Charity, the Galway County Association, the Irish Wheelchair Association and all the voluntary bodies who deal and work with people with disabilities. The co-ordinating committee has been very useful. County Galway VEC has provided courses for people with special needs and I hope this will continue in future. I also hope the Government will address the need for physiotherapists and speech therapists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case which has been ably made for the introduction of an independent living fund to deal with some of these issues. There has been a well argued case for a long time in that regard and it is important that it be established.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that there is provision in the capital programme for new initiatives. I welcome the one on training because one way people can become independent is by providing employment for them. Over 80% of people with disabilities are unemployed. Some £175 million is provided for training to equip people who can take up employment to find it. This is a welcome move in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I support the case made for an independent living fund and urge the Minister to take into account the views expressed by the disabled people of Clare and other organisations which have been to the forefront of this campaign, such as the soroptimists.</P>

      <P>Carers deserve greater recognition for their round the clock contribution to the health services and to society. The carer's allowance should be increased to at least £100 per week. Alongside this, the means test is a source of great annoyance and should at least be relaxed to allow for a higher disregard, thus increasing the numbers by at least 10,000. The neglect of family carers is scandalous when one considers the contribution they make in the Celtic tiger economy and the burden lifted from the State by its not having to commit tens of millions of pounds per year to additional institutionalised care. There is something rotten about an economy experiencing record growth, spending, revenue receipts, investment and performance when carers and the people they care for are being forced to protest, some in wheelchairs, at the gates of Parliament. It is a throwback to the Dickens era of &ldquo;please sir, can we have some more?&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Carers and the disabled quietly waited their turn for years and years. To quote the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment earlier this week &ldquo;there is nothing now that we cannot afford&rdquo;. The hour of the carer must have come at last and the Dickensian door can now be unlocked by the key of the millennium budget. I compliment the Carers' Association, the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Centre for Independent Living which operate to very good effect throughout Laoighis-Offaly. However, these groups are far too dependent on the support of FÁS for their survival. This support is not guaranteed as the Government proposes to cut FÁS numbers, thereby threatening the most vulnerable in our society. The relationship between FÁS and the disabled is haphazard and uncertain and, in effect, is not going anywhere. This is not surprising as the focus of FÁS in regard to the community employment schemes is totally different from that of the carers and the Irish Wheelchair Association. FÁS is centred around training and, once trained, people leave the schemes to take up full-time employment in various areas of the economy. This is not the fault of either FÁS or the people it trains; it is the fault of the Government which refuses to contemplate core full-time staffing. It is an example of crisis management at its worst. A complement of core staffing is required on a permanent basis. That is essential if those who are cared for are to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody is advocating that people with disabilities should be placed in a position of luxury or privilege of a special nature. The aim should be to allow those with disabilities as much freedom and independence as possible. Their physical needs should be met but so, too, should their emotional and psychological needs. Personal assistants allow for such development and free<Col N="148" /> dom and allow people to maximise their potential. The expansion of this scheme is a matter of urgency and importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Government to avail of the opportunity offered by the forthcoming budget to address the needs of those with physical and mental disabilities, the elderly and their carers. The word &ldquo;integration&rdquo; is being used increasingly. Let us see how serious the Minister's rhetoric is. He must provide funding to allow people with disabilities to participate fully and equally in society.</P>
      <P>It behoves all of us to address the needs which have been outlined by various groups here today. Representatives from the Centre for Independent Living outlined the difficulties they experience with the personal assistant scheme. They submitted a pre-budget proposal to the Minister for Finance outlining a package which, if implemented, would secure personal assistants for them at the required level. The provision of personal assistants is dependent on FÁS. Currently, personal assistants move on and do not have a permanent commitment to their positions. We must continue to invest in the training of personal assistants and the relationships they build up with those they assist. It is the personal assistant service which must be addressed, not the personal assistants themselves. The Irish Wheelchair Association has outlined many possible schemes to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Many elderly parents care for their children who suffer from mental disabilities and are concerned about what will happen to them when they die. The State has not made any provision for that. This week, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced a plan to build 5,000 houses per year over the coming seven years. Will any of those houses be adapted for people with disabilities? There is an urgent need for such housing in all local authority areas and I wonder whether the Minister has addressed the issue in any way.</P>
      <P>There is a need for occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and psychologists. The list has been well documented by many associations involved with people with disabilities. Now that we have the money to do so, we must address the needs of people with disabilities. There are long waiting lists for respite, residential and day care and essential aids and appliances are limited. The Government must realise it is time for the citizens of this State to be granted the equality they deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the limited time at my disposal, I wish to focus exclusively on the plight of carers in the home who are the real forgotten people in society. They are forgotten because it suits us to forget them. We do not want to be reminded that we ask members of our prosperous society to serve as nurses, friends, personal assistants, home helps, physiotherapists and occupational therapists 24 hours a day without offering them any respite, financial or physical support or recognition. We are assisted in this <Col N="149" /> self-induced amnesia by the fact that, for the most part, carers are unknown to State or health agencies because they do not appear on any lists. In order to appear on a list, it is necessary to qualify for something and because of the insultingly stringent means testing for the carer's allowance, very few people qualify for any assistance. Respite and support services simply do not exist for most carers and eventually they stop asking for them out of sheer frustration.</P>
      <P>Carers work silently, quietly and alone caring for their loved ones, some of whom are mentally disabled, some of whom are physically disabled and some of whom are both. Others care for elderly relatives who suffer from dementia and require round the clock care. Some carers are elderly people who have devoted their entire lives to the care of their sons and daughters. Many have given up work, careers and opportunities to care for relatives and others have never had the opportunity to work. Many carers live lives of quiet desperation. On duty 168 hours a week, they are physically and mentally exhausted, abandoned by society, ignored by the Celtic tiger, driven to ill health and often, regrettably, to an early death. At weekends, when the rest of us are out in pubs, clubs and restaurants worrying about how many holidays we will fit in in the year, the carers are on duty at home, alone for the most part. Most cannot remember when they last had a holiday and have little expectation of having one in the future. The only outing on which they can perhaps depend is a shopping outing at the weekend facilitated by the kindness of a friend or neighbour. We have all collectively allowed this to happen and that is to our shame. If we are not ashamed, we have, in our prosperity, lost our humanity and our sense of what it is to be part of an interdependent and self-supporting society.</P>
      <P>Since we last discussed this issue, a great deal of time has been spent discussing how we will spend the embarrassment of riches flowing into our coffers each day. We should decide tonight to end this institutionalised State abuse and exploitation of carers' sense of duty and devotion to their loved ones. We must provide some of the supports required to meet individual needs and allow carers to have the quality of life to which we all aspire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to focus on what I consider to be the critical issues raised during the debate. The level of disability payment is a critical issue. At the moment, recipients of the payment are treated similarly to other social welfare beneficiaries. Surely the special needs of, and hidden costs incurred by, people with disabilities should be considered. I appeal to the Minister to address this issue in the budget.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to County Kerry in my contribution. There is an urgent need for residential respite to give families and parents of children with disabilities a break. There is an obvious lack of respite care in County Kerry and support for those looking after people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resource centres also need to be improved. There are resource centres in Listowel and Killarney run through community employment <Col N="150" /> schemes. There is not a resource centre in Tralee, the main town in the county, which has a population of about 20,000 people. The employees of these resource centres should be core workers giving people with disabilities a better quality of service and more security. If the Tánaiste had her way there would not be any CE schemes in the future. What would then happen to these resource centres?</P>
    <P>Why are personal assistant services not available in Kerry or in Southern Health Board areas? Personal assistants are available in the Eastern Health Board area so why are they not available in the Southern Health Board area? Personal assistants can be critical to a disabled person depending on the disability. A personal assistant can carry out many tasks which some individuals cannot carry out for themselves, including tasks as simple as dressing or showering the disabled person.</P>
    <P>The rate of unemployment among people with disabilities runs at 70%. Fewer than one in ten has a basic weekly income of more than £100. There is not a centre for independent living in County Kerry. As someone who worked with children with special needs, I have often remarked that in this caring Christian society we cannot provide enough funds for people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely motion. In the National Development Plan 2000-06, in relation to health capital, we are told that the investment priorities among other things will be to address major needs in the provision of modern accommodation for the mentally ill and the physically disabled. However, in the body of the plan, there is little concrete evidence that this Government will address the many and serious needs of the physically disabled.</P>
      <P>I recently attended an open meeting with the Arklow Wheelchair Association and it outlined its priorities as submitted to the Minister for his consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget. Members of the group referred to residential respite, day resource centres, personal assistant services and a cost of disability payment scheme. This scheme would seek to address the fact that it costs more to meet basic economic needs when one suffers from a physical disability than when one does not. I felt embarrassed at that meeting as members of the group questioned members of the panel on aspects of their requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the points raised in the submission so I will dwell briefly on a few other areas. We are all familiar with the difficulties disabled drivers experience with insurance loadings and very often these same people cannot avail of a conversion grant. I would like the Minister to address this anomaly. Many people with disabilities feel completely isolated and very often this insecurity could be addressed by the provision of minimal funding. A large number of voluntary workers do excellent work in their capacity as carers but the remuneration is miniscule. I realise the Government in its last budget <Col N="151" /> provided measures in this area which cost £18 million and to exclude the carers allowance from means testing would cost an additional £100 million. While its exclusion would not be equitable, the allowance should be increased to reflect the excellent work done.</P>
    <P>During the Arklow meeting we were given a number of case studies on which to reflect. One of these concerned a person who lived in Wicklow town. Because the person suffered from cerebral palsy, he did not get out that much and, therefore, loved to use his computer. He had the Internet and said it would be a great advantage if a qualified computer instructor came to his home to teach him the different uses of his computer and the Internet. He could not afford a tutor. Can the Minister make some funding available for the education and training of people with physical disabilities?</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to the almost total absence of respite care and request the Minister to address this shameful neglect. I pay tribute to the many people, particularly in the voluntary area, who work with people with physical disabilities and the courage displayed by many people who suffer from physical disability in a world which does not seem to care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have an opportunity to make up for acknowledged underfunding in the past and the consequent hardship and lost opportunities of people with physical disabilities and their families. It is no doubt pay-back time for people who need support, their families and for people in great need. They have been called 'the forgotten people' and I call on Deputies on all sides not to forget anymore.</P>
      <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association has identified four needs which it sees as essential at this time &ndash; residential respite, day care resource centres, personal assistant services and the cost of disability payment scheme. It says it costs money to live whether one is disabled or abled. In areas such as equipment, travel, telephone, fuel, food and clothing, medical care and assistance and so on, it is pay back time.</P>
      <P>I allude also to children with disabilities, children attending special schools who do not have speech therapists or physiotherapists and whose parents &ndash; their carers &ndash; are extremely worried. I ask the Minister and the Government to ensure that enough speech therapists and physiotherapists are available to special schools so that children with disabilities can get a head start. I ask the Minister of State to investigate this matter and to report to the House on what is happening in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Politics is about choices. Every day we meet in this House, we make a choice as to whether we, as a Parliament, will support particular groups who are suffering. As Deputies on all sides have said, this Celtic tiger economy provides our country with a phenomenal opportunity to tackle disadvantage once and for all and to create a society in which those who have suffered for generations are given an opportunity to partici<Col N="152" /> pate in our society. The greatest example of that is people with disabilities, their families and carers. They have suffered for far too long.</P>
      <P>When I listened to Deputy McGuinness speak in support of the Government amendment, the words of Norman Tebbit echoed in my ears. He lectured us on this financial auditing of the Eastern Health Board and said it is not just a question of money. It is fundamentally a question of finance and of ensuring people are given a far greater opportunity in the allowances which are provided by our State.  Politics is about choices so where will the Independent Deputies be tonight when the substantive motion in the name of my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and my party is put to the House? The Independents have no difficulty voting against the Government when it is abundantly clear that a majority of Members are in favour of a position, as with PfP and other issues. Where will they be tonight? They cannot hide from their responsibilities tonight, they must own up to them and ensure carers and families looking after the disabled enjoy a fair and equitable standard of living once and for all.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health and Children made a lengthy speech last night heavy in detail about the programmes and initiatives in his Department for carers and people with disabilities, but obviously lacking in a real understanding of the issues confronting many of those who day in, day out must try to exist &ndash; I use the word &ldquo;exist&rdquo; advisedly &ndash; in a society which is ill-equipped to meet the real needs of the elderly, their carers and, especially, the needs of the disabled.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me, I will deal briefly with disability issues and, in particular, the need for an independent living fund. On numerous occasions, we have played political games with disability issues, and I use the word &ldquo;we&rdquo; because all politicians have. We have packed the Visitor's Gallery with the disabled and their representatives raising expectations only to repeatedly fail them by our actions and policies. By our collective failure, not only do we discredit politics but we diminish our own humanity and that of the society and electorate we represent. The Minister is in an unprecedented position given the amount of money available to the Exchequer. Notwithstanding the inevitable division on tonight's motion, to judge from Members' contributions the Minister has virtually unanimous support in the House for solving this problem once and for all.</P>
      <P>The first sentence of the Government amendment reads: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services to people with disabilities, their families and carers&rdquo;. That is one step along the road we need to travel, but regrettably the rest of the amendment goes into self-justification and an automatic defensive mode. If we really recognised the need for further development and for initiatives for carers and those with disabilities, we would not be satisfied with the <i>status quo</i> or the Minister's contribution last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> A paraphrase of contributions to this debate would be that we know what has been done and we know that our starting point was inadequate; we recognise the plans from the Department of Health and Children but they are not enough and we need to accelerate those proposals; and we need further funding to develop more services. After all, what service does a successful economy serve if it does not provide funding for those on the margins of society? To put it bluntly, the disabled have waited long enough.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to speak on this motion and that the Minister of State from Mayo is here because I have a simple request for him that he and his officials can deal with in the next couple of weeks. The Minister of State and I know that the people of Belmullet have been disadvantaged since the foundation of the State. They do not have public transport &ndash; CIE does not go to Belmullet so they must depend on private operators for transport. The people of Belmullet have acquired a two acre site and want to build 13 specially adapted units for people with disabilities and all they want is £1 million. I am pleading with the Minister of State as a Mayoman to make sure that the necessary funding is provided for the people of north Mayo. They have a site but what they need now are pounds, shillings and pence. We are being told about billions of pounds but we are only looking for £1 million. I ask the Minister of State to ensure his officials are taking notes on this so that he can announce that funding after the budget.</P>
      <P>This has not been a very caring Government. Its first two budgets looked after the rich. Members will know the song, &ldquo;Now is the hour&rdquo; and now is the hour to look after people with disabilities such as those in the Public Gallery. In my constituency and in others, for too long people with disabilities were hidden. They were hidden away in back rooms and one was told not to let friends or neighbours see them. Those days are gone and these people now deserve a piece of the national cake. In the past we did not have the money, but now we do. Not one person would disagree with the Government allocating the necessary funds to the disabled on a once-off basis in the December budget. I am telling the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that now is the hour. The time has come to look after people with disabilities now that we have the money. I ask the Government to look after them because we have forgotten them for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a person in my clinic last week who was in Dublin recently. He wanted to go into a lovely restaurant in the new facility in Heuston Station but he could not bring his wheelchair into it. When he wanted to go to the toilet he had to look for a key. This is 1999 and we must look after people. According to the Constitution we are all equal, but in the real world we are not. The rich are getting richer, the sick are getting sicker, the poor are getting poorer and those with disabilities <Col N="154" /> are getting no assistance from the State. It is time they got that assistance and now we have the opportunity to do so. We support that and so does the general public. It is their hour and I repeat to the Government that now is the hour.</P>

      <P>The party leader coming up the tracks. I support the motion and I acknowledge the role of carers in our society, some of whom are in the Public Gallery. I also acknowledge the courage of those with handicaps in overcoming their disabilities and getting on with life. Their courage has been a source of inspiration to many people. It is also time the Government acknowledged the role of the elderly who have come through hard times and who, in their retirement, might at least expect some comfort.</P>
      <P>The Government recently announced not a spending programme but a spending spree. However, no funds have been allocated to the care of the elderly or the handicapped; this is regrettable. I acknowledge that public and private nursing homes have a contribution to make and I welcome their development, but they provide a fallback. If one talks to people with a handicap or the elderly they will tell one they would rather be in their own homes where, as an elderly person might say, they are in their own corner where they are lord and master. That is not much to ask and it is the least they should expect.</P>
      <P>Many elderly people are lonely, given that the fast pace of modern life means neighbours and friends seldom call. They are on their own and the postman's knock is welcome. Carers have a role to play in calling, chatting and making the difference that makes life more comfortable. The handicapped are in a similar position and need people to call to them. The role of the carer cannot be overstated.</P>
      <P>Regarding mobility, a car can take elderly or handicapped people to their local town or village or a place of entertainment. Electronic wheelchairs are not much to ask for those with a disability, but they are costly for a person of limited means. The State has announced a £40 billion spending spree which includes goodies for everyone but nothing for those who worked for this country and handed it on to us or for those with disabilities through no fault of their own. Those little provisions would make all the difference for them.</P>
      <P>Accessibility to their own homes and to places of public importance is also important, as Deputy Ring said. Local authorities have a role to play in ensuring that the homes of the elderly and those with disabilities are accessible. Those are small items but are often overlooked. Special grants are needed but we are not talking about vast amounts of money. Small amounts of money will make all the difference to the quality of people's lives and we will have failed if we do not acknowledge that and if we do not make that contribution to those people.</P>

      <P>Now that we have a wheelchair bus <Col N="155" /> in Longford there an allowance should be provided. The Outreach centre in Aughnacliffe should also receive an allowance. As my colleagues have said, the role of the personal assistant is vital. I have met people involved in this area and they have spelt out how important those assistants are. Some Ministers have one personal assistant, while others have up to five and they were not on FÁS schemes either. I ask the Minister of State to put a scheme in place for personal assistants in order that people can have dignity in their lives. The disabled person's grant should also be raised to 100%; although it is now two-thirds, the applicant often cannot find the extra third. There should be a mechanism ensuring that the grant is raised to 100% in certain cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to the motion, the Government requested that the Opposition recognise the record of the Government to date in responding to the needs of people with disabilities, older persons, those with mental illness and their carers. However, the need for the ongoing development of support services is stated upfront and this Government is committed to further enhancing the level of support services available to those who require them.</P>
      <P>Last night my colleague, Deputy Cowen, Minister for Health and Children, outlined the framework within which services to persons with disabilities are being developed. This encompasses not just the health sector, but initiatives across many Departments. The legislative framework is being put in place to support the right to services, facilities and employment opportunities. There has been a major enhancement in the support available to children with special educational needs over the past two years. Training and employment support opportunities are being mainstreamed, with the Department of Health and Children retaining responsibility for the rehabilitation services.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Ring, the CIE bus goes through Belmullet and on to Blacksod. However, I will take up the challenge from the Deputy and we will see what we can do about the situation in Belmullet. For the past two and a half years it has done quite well as regards health services.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, spoke of a number of initiatives which have been put in place including the extension of the carers allowance, respite care grants and changes in the regulations governing the payment of the disability allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding amounting to £42.357 million has been provided for services to people with physical or sensory disabilities in the period 1997<Col N="156" /> 99 &ndash; £38.662 million of this funding was provided by this Government. The pre-budget submissions made by the various national representative groups set out a requirement for a broad range of support services, including residential, respite, personal assistants and the need for increased access to multi-disciplinary support. The Government is committed to the ongoing enhancement of these services.</P>
    <P>The Government has already made significant additional funding available for the provision of aids and appliances, having allocated a total of £9.325 million over the past two and a half years. Consideration is currently being given to the allocation of further additional funding for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Additional funding amounting to almost £113 million has been invested in services to persons with an intellectual disability in the period 1993 to 1999 &ndash; £53 million of this funding has been allocated by this Government since it came into office in mid-1997. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, reiterated his commitment to the further development of these services when he recently met representatives of the various national organisations involved in this area and informed them that it was his intention, subject to Government agreement, to have significantly reduced the waiting lists, in addition to having enhanced the level of respite care available, over the next two years.</P>
      <P>The additional revenue funding provided to services for older people in 1997 amounted to £3 million. In 1999 it had increased to £25 million and next year will be £35.4 million. Funding for the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, has risen from £17 million in 1997 to £33 million in 1999. The commitment to the further enhancement of the support available to carers is obvious. The Government will continue to build on the progress made in recent years in these areas. Between 1998 and 1999, additional funding amounting to £19.4 million was allocated by this Government for developments in the mental health services. It is our intention to continue the development of the support services available to both patients and their families.</P>
      <P>Significant additional funding has been made available in the Estimates for services to persons with disabilities, older people and people with mental health problems &ndash; £10.7 million is being made available to services to persons with an intellectual disability. This funding will be used to meet the full year cost of the 1999 developments and to meet identified needs in existing services. An additional £10.8 million is being made available to services for people with physical or sensory disabilities. As in the case of services to persons with an intellectual disability, this funding will be used to meet the full year cost of the 1999 developments and identified needs in existing services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> In all, the level of investment made by this Government in developing and enhancing support services for people with disabilities, older people, those with mental health problems and their carers is the concrete evidence of their ongoing commitment to provide as much assistance as possible to those who require it from the various agencies of the State. This is not just words alone.</P>

      <P>I would much prefer if Fine Gael did not have to table this motion &ndash; in fact, it should be redundant. I would be far happier if my task tonight was to congratulate the Government and to feel proud of the support this State gives to carers and those for whom they care. Unfortunately, this is not the case. On the threshold of a bright and new 21st century and in the midst of an unprecedented economic boom, this Government is still in the Dark Ages when it comes to carers and care requirements for the elderly, the mentally ill and people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>This motion is not only timely, it is necessary. The evidence required to support this motion and to illustrate that patience is running out and we need to make serious investment in State supports and the provision of care for people with disabilities and their families, is around us in abundance. It is clear from the number of people in the Gallery this evening who came here to hear this debate; it is clear from the large advertisements in the newspapers, the enormous billboards and posters on buses; it is clear from the number of demonstrations outside this House in the past two years; and it is clear to every public representative who has heard at first hand from his constituents the anger and frustration at the slow pace of change in State service provision and support for carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite commitments given by successive Governments, the priorities afforded to the needs and rights of people in disabilities in Partnership 2000, the recommendations in reports such as Towards an Independent Future and A Strategy for Equality, and the raising in public consciousness about people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates, change, if any is painfully slow. There is no dispute in this House about what needs to be done. What is in dispute is when <Col N="158" /> it should be done. The promises in the newly published national plan, the fine words of the Government's relaunched An Action Programme for the Millennium and the aspirational messages delivered by the Minister for Health and Children are all very well but words alone make no real difference to the lives of people with disabilities or to those who care for them, unless they are backed by capital and Revenue resources.</P>
    <P>People need to see the colour of the Government's money and the quick and efficient delivery of services. The submission of the Irish Wheelchair Association sums up the case of their members eloquently and cogently and also applies to those in the intellectual and sensory disability sectors, those with mental illness and especially those who care for them. The submission states:</P>
    <P>Recognising the daily evidence of the spending power which is now around us, how long and how much do you expect us to keep faith with the political process? Given the present booming state of our economy, how much longer are we expected to wait for delivery on the commitments made almost a decade ago. Let us have no more false promises. Let budget day be the real start &ndash; the start of honest and sustained action to deliver on an long overdue commitment.</P>
    <P>I ask this Government to ensure this budget delivers for people in need of care and to those who care for them. The tabling of this motion should not become an annual event in this House.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party wish we had the Government's resources and its opportunities to deliver what is needed to people with disabilities and to provide real support for carers. There is no reason the budget should not change the lives of carers forever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Disabled people are still getting a raw deal despite the fact that the economy is awash with money. I wish to outline the plight of two people I met two days ago in County Galway. What happened to them is shameful and it appears that the State is hell bent on making a difficult situation worse for them. Over the past few years, serious illness has visited both spouses; one spouse had major surgery because of advancing cancer and has a permanent disability as a result. Her husband had serious brain surgery at the same time in addition to a major stomach problem and several minor illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As both spouses were employed outside the State and the European Union in previous years, they found on their return to Ireland a year ago that they had to satisfy a means assessment to obtain social welfare. Eventually both qualified for disability allowance at the rate of £73.50 each a week. The husband was encouraged on medical grounds to take up a light job outside the home and, after a long time, he secured a place on the local FÁS scheme. He only had the job for a week when the Department of Social, Com<Col N="159" /> munity and Family Affairs wrote to him and told him that because he was working, his benefit would be reduced by £50 a week. However, worse news was on the way.</P>
    <P>Three days later his wife received a letter from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs stating that her income would be reduced by £31 because her husband was working on a FÁS scheme. One would think that should be the end of their bad news, but worse followed when they applied to the Western Health Board for a mobility allowance. The movements of the woman are seriously impaired because of her disability, but she could not get the allowance. She was told that her disability was not bad enough although she had lost one of her limbs. These people have a ten year old car and they were advised for therapeutic reasons to take some short spins into the countryside. However, they could not get the mobility allowance.</P>
    <P>This is happening at a time of remarkable progress in the economy. The Government's National Development Plan mentions spending money that we never thought we would have. Surely no Minister or Government could stand over what happened the couple I mentioned. I ask the Minister to do something about this immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the wonderful work of carers and personal assistants in my county and elsewhere. In common with Deputy Connaughton, I wish to highlight a number of anomalies which have come to my attention in my work as a public representative.</P>
      <P>I have been making representations for the past three years for changes to a ministerial regulation. This concerns the case of a woman who is caring for a bed ridden, doubly incontinent person in her home. Unfortunately, the woman became a widow after her husband was killed in an accident. She qualified for the carer's allowance when her husband was alive because he was a small farmer with an income of less than £150 a week. After he died, she applied for the widow's pension and was awarded it. However, one day later, her carer's allowance of £73.50 was revoked because she was in receipt of the widow's pension. She is still caring full-time for her husband's relative in the home and wishes to continue doing so. However, she cannot get the carer's allowance although she only received the widow's pension to compensate for the loss of her husband's income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have continually asked the Minister to address this anomaly. I made submissions to the review board which discussed this matter for over two years, but no progress has been made. I want this anomaly corrected because it is hugely discriminatory that such a person should be denied the carer's allowance because she became a widow and qualified for the widow's pension. I have begged the Minister to address this issue but I have not received a response. I was told changes <Col N="160" /> in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs would cost £15 million. However, following a recent parliamentary question, I discovered that only 16 widows applied for the carer's allowance in one year. That would not cost £15 million to administer and I again appeal to the Minister to address this matter. I intend to take every opportunity available to me to highlight this anomaly.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly arises where a person is in receipt of social welfare. If a wife is a carer, she effectively loses £43.50 a week from her allowance if her husband is in receipt of social welfare. He cannot claim for her because she in receipt of the carer's allowance. A further anomaly arises where the spouse of a carer is working outside the home. The carer's allowance is added to the husband's income for tax purposes. The Minister should deal with these three major anomalies but if the first one I mentioned was addressed, I would be satisfied with my contribution as a Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The plight of carers and the reforms which are needed have been set out by my colleagues in relation to the means test for the 100,000 carers. It costs £75 a week to pay a carer but it costs £250 a week to keep a person in a nursing home and £350 a week to keep a person in a geriatric long stay bed. The cheapest thing the Government could ever do is radically reform the terms and allowances of carers.</P>
      <P>The quality of life for disabled persons is critically related to mobility and transport. The Government has only paid lip service to accessibility and I wish to make an appeal on behalf of the Vantastic group in Dublin which provides a client based, door to door service for 400 people from Baldoyle to Bray. This service could be franchised across the country and the group has met the Taoiseach and four Ministers about this matter. It has been shuffled like a deck of cards but the group needs £350,000 a year. I appeal to the Government to make this allocation because the group can provide the transport service disabled people need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Members of the House to remember the mentally ill. I visited somebody who is ill in a mental hospital and I was appalled by the gloomy, smoke filled conditions. There is little for mentally ill people to do in hospitals and if they smoke, they do so all the time. This smoke is blown in the face of other patients who do not smoke.</P>
      <P>It is important to try to understand the reasons people become mentally ill. It is not understood internationally. For example, it is not well understood why some people become depressed and others do not or why some people can survive certain shocks but others cannot. Mental illness is probably the one form of disability which is least discussed. As a result, the suffering is greater because a suffering shared is a suffering diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> I hope Members will bear in mind that there is child abuse but there is also abuse of the elderly. The elderly are frequently beaten by their carers. It is a pity that there is no system of inspection which is comprehensive of all homes, including State homes, in which the elderly are looked after. Any system of inspection should be universal. In addition, the standards of care and defence of the rights of the elderly should be universal and not only confined to the inspection of private homes. I compliment Deputy Ring for raising this matter on a previous occasion.</P>
    <P>I also compliment Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and Deputy Theresa Ahearn, our spokesperson on disabilities, who are the authors of the motion and who brought forward this important issue for debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> This is one of the last Private Members' motions that will be debated in the House this millennium. We should not forget that this millennium commemorates an event two thousand years ago, the birth of Christ. The measure of the Christianity and civilisation of this country is in the way it treats those who can speak least on their own behalf. Carers, those who are cared for, those who are vulnerable, those who are ill, mentally or physically, are the people who make the greatest call on our civilisation and Christianity. Now that we have the opportunity to do something about it in this House I hope something will be done as a result of this motion.</P>

      <P>Over the past four months, north eastern Turkey has been devastated by two major earthquakes. The severity of these quakes has left more than 40,000 people dead, scores have been injured and many thousands are now homeless, trying to fight off the extreme winter temperatures under plastic sheeting.</P>
      <P>In the face of all this devastation, the only offering from the Irish Government to date was £200,000 &ndash; a pitiful amount of money that would only purchase a few ministerial cars or go half way towards covering the projected telephone and postal bills of the Taoiseach for the coming year.</P>
      <P>This morning, the Taoiseach went on the national airwaves pledging to the Irish people that he would make contact with the Turkish Prime Minister in an attempt to secure transmission rights to broadcast tonight's soccer encounter. I have no doubt that many Irish people would view the Taoiseach's phone call as a good move. However, I am sure the Turkish Prime Minister has more important issues on his mind than football. This week, hundreds of families are burying their dead following Friday's shocking earthquake. Many more families are wondering if they will ever retrieve the bodies of their relatives from the rubble.</P>
      <P>During this time of tremendous grief for the Turkish people, the best phone call which the Taoiseach could have made to their Prime Minister would be one which pledged a substantial donation to their on-going relief programme for victims of the recent earthquakes. Such a phone call may not secure front page headlines for the Taoiseach in Irish newspapers, but it would go a long way in helping the displaced people to rebuild some kind of a life for themselves.</P>
      <P>The search for survivors of Friday's earthquake is winding up. Anyone trapped under rubble would be dead by now so the rescue teams from Britain, Slovenia and Italy have decided to begin their journey home, but this does not mean that the work has been done. It will take many years before the families who have been displaced are housed again. In the interim, their basic needs of clothing, temporary accommodation and food must to be provided for.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago the Government was gung-ho about the impact which Ireland's troops could make on the international stage if they were part of Partnership for Peace. Turkey needs help now. The RAF and other EU army personnel are on the ground in north-east Turkey. Does the Government have any plans to deploy Army personnel for the purpose of the relief operation?</P>
      <P>The £200,000 contribution which the Irish Government made to the Red Cross relief fund for the Turkish earthquake in August is grossly inadequate. In fact, it belittled the extent of the disaster which has taken place in that country.</P>
      <P>We have an obligation to increase the ODA contribution. Yet again, in the pre-budget estimates for this year the allocation for ODA barely hovers above 0.3%. In the last year, despite our growing wealth, Ireland still drew down the high proportion of EU receipts. As a nation, we must learn to give as well as take. An announcement of additional aid to help with the Turkish relief project would be a start.</P>
      <P>Since the weekend, most mentions of Turkey in the national media have concentrated on the match, the Turkish baths which Irish fans are enjoying and the row over the televising of the match. It is time that the plight of the devastated people of Turkey had their story told lest they be forgotten and, indeed, this Administration could conveniently forget about them too.</P>

      <P>The Government welcomes this opportunity to update the House on the current situation in Turkey. Once again the people of Turkey have been faced with the trauma of a major earthquake which has devastated lives and homes. I share the Deputy's sense of irony that so much of today's public debate was on the match in Turkey and its transmission when most of my considerations, like those of the Deputy, related to the humanitarian disaster in Turkey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> On 17 August a massive earthquake hit the densely populated Marmara region in the north-west of Turkey. This was followed by hundreds of subsequent aftershocks, which continue to occur in the area. The Turkish Government declared a state of emergency and requested international assistance. The official death toll from that earthquake now stands at over 17,000 and the number of reported injured stands at almost 44,000. Currently 130,000 people are living in tent cities and a further 80,000 are living in <i>ad hoc</i> settlements.</P>
    <P>The international response in the aftermath of the earthquake was both quick and generous. Search and rescue teams were despatched to the site of the disaster within hours. The initial emphasis was on searching for and rescuing those trapped in the rubble of destroyed buildings. As in any disaster, the overwhelming majority of all rescues, 95%, were carried out locally before the arrival of international assistance. The search and rescue teams were responsible for about 5% of the rescues in Turkey and were geared, in line with their mission, towards the most difficult recoveries. Aid flooded in from around the world from both government organisations and public donations, with over 46 countries providing assistance.</P>
    <P>On 12 November a second major earthquake struck Duzce, a populated area of the Marmara region. Its epicentre was just 100 kilometres from Izmit, the centre of the earthquake in August. Building on their experience in August, the Turkish Government response was quick. Once again international search and rescue teams arrived at the site within hours.</P>
    <P>Latest figures put the death toll from this most recent quake at 549, with over 3,000 injured. Duzce had already been severely affected by the August quake. This most recent quake resulted in 80 to 90% of the remaining buildings being damaged. Currently, in Duzce, all of the survivors in the town are camping out, either unable or unwilling to return to their homes due to damage because of the fear of aftershocks.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has been to the forefront in providing humanitarian aid to the victims of these disasters. We co-ordinated our response with the aid flowing in from other countries and concentrated on meeting the priority needs of the thousands of injured and homeless. Since the first earthquake in August, Ireland has provided £700,000 in humanitarian assistance. The following specific grants have been provided. An initial grant of £200,000 was made in the immediate aftermath of the disaster to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent to enable them to purchase essential supplies such as food, water and any medicines available locally. This was the most effective way of ensuring appropriate assistance quickly. It is quicker and also helps the local economy which is suffering badly. The sum of £50,000 was then allocated to the United <Col N="166" /> Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which assists the Turkish Government in co-ordinating the relief effort. The sum of £150,000 was granted to UNICEF for the provision of water and sanitation and also to supply humanitarian goods such as bedding, fuel and medicines. At the request of the Turkish Government, £190,000 was used to purchase in Ireland medical supplies and water purification tablets which were unavailable in Turkey. Over four tonnes of these goods were transported to Istanbul at no cost by Aer Lingus and Turkish Airlines. The sum of £75,000 has been made available this week to the United Nations Development Programme which has a shelter programme addressing the needs of those left homeless by both earthquakes. A further £75,000 has been given to UNICEF this week for its recent appeal which will address the nutritional needs of children and pregnant mothers living in shelters and provide materials for tent schools. Both UNICEF and the United Nations Development Programme are also providing tents, sleeping bags, generators and stoves in response to those left homeless by the most recent earthquake. In terms of the provision of human resources, while Ireland has considerable search and rescue capability, we do not possess the specialised training that is required in earthquake situations.</P>
    <P>The European Union, on behalf of the member states, has also responded generously. The European Commission <i>via</i> the European Community Humanitarian Office announced an initial grant of 2 million euros in emergency humanitarian assistance just hours after the earthquake. A further grant of 2 million euros was made available as needs became clearer. This is part of a planned 30 million euro package of assistance. ECHO is focusing on addressing the needs of the persons made homeless by the disaster, providing weather resistant shelter and ensuring basic medical care. An ECHO field expert has been posted to Istanbul in order to facilitate further assessments.</P>
    <P>While the emergency response to the needs of the survivors of both quakes was quick and comprehensive, the Turkish Government now faces the formidable task of rebuilding the Marmara region. It is being supported in this by the international community. The immediate and long-term reconstruction effort in Turkey is being funded on a multilateral basis. The European Commission is proceeding with plans for new and substantial assistance for rehabilitation and reconstruction to come from European Investment Bank lending as well as macro-financial assistance and Mediterranean Assistance Development Programme funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. It is proposed that loans of up to 600 million euros be provided to Turkey to assist in the reconstruction process. In addition, 150 million euros, earmarked as regional aid for Turkey, will be allocated to assist in the reconstruction effort. Substantial assistance is also being provided by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>While the scale of these disasters has stretched available resources to their limits, Turkey is a developed country which has considerable resources with which to respond to the earthquakes. Turkey's large modern armed forces can be mobilised to assist relief efforts. The economy can support much of the relief and reconstruction efforts. Therefore, the role of the international community is to assist and facilitate the Turkish Government and people in their efforts to deal with their current problems.</P>
      <P>In allocating funding I have taken into account not only the very clear needs in Turkey but also those elsewhere. Unfortunately, this is just one of a number of disasters, natural and man made, in recent months. Ongoing emergencies in East Timor, Central Africa, India and Chechnya, to name just a few, also require Ireland's attention. Ireland has given generously to these and will continue to do so as it becomes necessary.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Gas Pipeline Extension.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I am glad to see here the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, who has responsibility for this matter.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the recent proposal by Bord Gáis Éireann to seek approval under section 8 of the Gas Act, 1976, and the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1998, to extend the national gas grid from Dublin to Galway and onwards to Limerick without taking into account points west and north-west of that line. Bord Gáis made a proposal to the Government of which I was a member to run a pipeline, I believe, from Dundalk to Sligo and then southwards to serve all the major towns such as Ballina, Castlebar, Tuam, Galway and points further south. It may be that there is a simple explanation for this. Yesterday, the Minister and Minister of State, who have responsibility for bringing gas ashore and for distributing it on the mainland, answered a series of questions about Enterprise Oil's find in the Corrib field off Achill Head. This reputedly contains 1.3 trillion cubic metres of gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the Bord Gáis proposal to extend the pipeline from Dundalk through <Col N="168" /> Athlone, where the Minister for Public Enterprise resides, to Galway and on to Limerick does not cater for the region to the west and north-west. It may be that Enterprise Oil may have informed the Department that it will build its own pipeline if the find is deemed to be commercial. That may be the reason that Bord Gáis has not included this in its proposal. The Minister may be able to confirm that. Given that in the national development plan which was published earlier this week £40 billion will be spent over the next seven years, that Objective One status was granted to the Border, midlands and western region following a long struggle and that the Western Development Commission has been established with the specific task of attempting to raise the economic and industrial base in the west to a level similar to that in other areas, this major proposal by Bord Gáis should not leave that vast tract of territory without a pipeline.</P>
    <P>The ESB recently reported that there is a major power shortage in the loop west and north-west and that no heavy industry of serious consequence can be placed there because of lack of power. Natural gas is a major source of power and Bord Gáis, while proposing to extend its pipeline, intends to build a second interconnector to Scotland. This would mean that if Enterprise Oil was to declare its find commercial and bring the gas ashore, and if it followed through with further appraisal wells on the Shannon prospect south of the Corrib field, that the second interconnector could be used as an export conduit on to the British mainland and the European grid.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister of State can reply to my questions. Has Enterprise Oil confirmed that it would be prepared to build its own gas pipeline in the western region to serve the west and north-west? Has it confirmed that, in preparing to declare the field to be commercial, it is going to land the gas in County Mayo, specifically, either in Ballyglass or Killala? This is critical, both for the establishment of a power base, perhaps at Bellacorick, for the generation of electricity and as a strong incentive for major industry to locate in the region.</P>
    <P>Given Government statements, and the fact that the part of the country to which I refer has been neglected and is recognised as being disadvantaged both nationally and in Brussels, it is strange that Bord Gáis' major proposal to extend the gas pipeline ignores that entire region. An explanation is required in this regard. If Bord Gáis has not provided such an explanation or if Enterprise Oil has not confirmed that it intends to build its own gas pipeline, the Minister of State should give the necessary instruction to Bord Gáis that the proposal be altered to include a provision for the pipeline to run to Sligo and the north-west and to run south from Sligo to Ballina Castlebar, Tuam and Galway.</P>
    <P>If and when this gas is brought ashore from the Corrib field, the area in question will be able to avail of it or, if necessary, new gas can be imported through the existing interconnector or <Col N="169" /> the second interconnector, if it proceeds. It is necessary for an area, even the one in which the Leas Cheann-Comhairle lives, to have a strong power base to use as a marketing instrument to attract industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a base helps one deal with the questions and queries raised by investors regarding the supply of power in an area.</P>
      <P>I understand that there will be a number of underwater templates in the case in question. The landing point is critical. On another occasion we will deal with the benefits that can be derived for the local economy in the western region if and when this find is deemed to be commercial and brought ashore.</P>
      <P>Why was the region ignored in the Bord Gáis proposal? Is it because Enterprise Oil intends to build its own pipeline? Will the Minister of State instruct Bord Gáis to change the proposal&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to clarify the situation in relation to a proposal by Bord Gáis Éireann to construct a pipeline, which has been widely reported on in the past week.</P>
      <P>BGE submitted an application to me recently seeking approval under the Gas Acts, 1976 to 1998, to construct a natural gas transmission pipe between Dublin &ndash; not Dundalk &ndash; Galway and Limerick. The effect of this would be to complete a national gas ring main that would bring gas west, facilitate the transmission of additional gas to the south and obviate the need to strengthen the Dublin/Cork pipeline which is reaching full capacity. The application is being examined in my Department in the light of my obligations under the Gas Acts. I have not yet given my consent to it. The application will also be examined in the context of the emerging regulatory environment for the liberalised gas market, the outcome of recent studies into gas demand and infrastructure requirements to the year 2025 and the possibility of gas being developed commercially off the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996, Bord Gáis carried out a detailed study of a number of network extensions to the west. None of the scenarios studied by Bord Gáis at that time showed a positive return on the investment involved and the company was not in a position to undertake the project in the absence of Exchequer or EU funds of the order of £60 mill<Col N="170" /> ion. From a shareholder perspective, I will need to be satisfied that this latest proposal satisfies normal commercial criteria for the construction of gas pipelines. BGE's balance sheet would have to be able to support such a project, taking account of BGE's current business plan and opportunities for its future development as a best practise gas utility. A project of this magnitude would have to be examined in detail before approval could be given.</P>
    <P>The proposed pipeline will also have to be examined in the context of the changing regulatory environment for the natural gas industry. The industry in Ireland, and in other member states of the EU, is in a state of change following the entry into force of the EU Gas Directive. All member states, including Ireland, are currently in the process of making the relevant changes to the domestic legislation governing their national gas industries in order to comply with the provisions of this directive.</P>
    <P>Liberalisation of the market offers possibilities for new players to become involved. We have been to the fore in opening our natural gas market to competition. Already, players other than BGE are entitled to become involved in the supply of natural gas to the competitive section of the market and to build their own pipelines. Some have already expressed an interest in doing so. In the newly liberalised gas market, BGE will be treated in the same manner as any other player.</P>
    <P>Another potentially influential development is the gas find in the Corrib field off the Mayo coast. While the prospects for the field look promising, the consortium involved in the exploration of the field has indicated that further appraisals will have to be carried out before a decision can be taken on whether the field is to be developed commercially. When the board of Enterprise Oil visited Ireland recently, I urged its members to clarify their intentions in this regard as quickly as possible. If the field is developed commercially, it will have a significant impact on the natural gas industry here. It is prudent that we await developments in relation to the Corrib field but we cannot wait indefinitely.</P>
    <P>It is in this wider context that the application by BGE will be considered. In the meantime I will be asking BGE to clarify the details of its pipeline proposal. I must be convinced that it is commercially viable and that it will benefit the Irish natural gas industry and gas consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter. I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter yesterday but, unfortunately, because of time constraints, I could not respond to the points raised in the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State cannot intervene in individual housing cases, nor do I expect that he would do so. I also want to answer <Col N="171" /> a point he made yesterday. The Minister said that I should contact Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in respect of the issues I have raised. I assure the Minister that I would not bring them to the floor of this House unless I had made numerous representations, written and by telephone, without much success. The Minister can ensure that the local authority applies the letting priorities scheme in accordance with the scheme approved by him and his Department. This is what I am asking.</P>
    <P>I will highlight the manner in which gross overcrowding points are applied. I will repeat the examples I gave yesterday. A widow with a 14 year old son and a 19 year old daughter living in a one bedroom flat does not get any points for gross overcrowding or for her daughter because she is now over 18. What that has to do with housing conditions is beyond me. I raised this matter with the local authority with no success.</P>
    <P>The next case I mentioned was that of a mother and daughter in her early 20s. The mother was evicted from the house she had rented for a number of years because her rent, as is common in my area, was increased from £400 per month to £800. She fought the case in both the District Court and the Circuit Court. She then had to move in with her son and daughter in law and their baby, who live in a two bedroom house. Points are not given for the daughter because she is now in her early 20s, despite the fact that this lady has been on the housing list for eight to ten years. When she went on the housing list, her daughter was in her early teens. Neither are gross overcrowding points being given despite the fact that they are sleeping the same bedroom as the grandchild and her daughter shares the bed with the grandchild. The answer I got to my query was that it was not the proper use of accommodation. In a two bedroom house? Simple overcrowding points but no gross overcrowding points were given. In that case, if the person had been given the correct points, she would be at the top of the list.</P>
    <P>In the third case a divorced mother and her daughter, aged 17, are sleeping on a mattress in the sitting room because the bedrooms are full. The local authority refuses to give gross overcrowding points because it says the sleeping area is adequate given the measurements of the room. Since when are people expected to live in the sitting room on a mattress on the floor? By the same logic, if a person lives in the back yard, they will not get gross overcrowding points because the yard is too big.</P>
    <P>These are matters which are subject to a letting priority scheme which should be the business of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister in his reply say if he thinks it is reasonable that there should be a cessation of points when a child reaches 18 because that then reduces the number of points a person has, despite the fact that the child is still living with <Col N="172" /> the applicant? It has nothing to do with housing conditions.</P>
    <P>In his reply yesterday, the Minister stated that it is ten years since the explanatory notes and guidelines were issued by his Department for housing authorities. I respectfully suggest that after ten years it is time those guidelines were updated and that the Department pays attention to how the letting priority schemes are being worked by the local authorities, particularly by the environmental health officers who carry out the inspections.</P>
    <P>I recognise that it is a matter for the local authority members to draw up a letting priority scheme but my understanding, confirmed by the Minister's reply, is that each time it is altered, it requires his and the Department's approval. I have been a public representative for 25 years and never in that time have I witnessed worse housing conditions in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area. It is extraordinary that in a local authority area where there is no programme to deal with a list of 1,800 people, there is no land available and people are left on the housing list while stricter application of the scheme is applied by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to respond to the points I have made rather than give an overall statement from the Department. I do not expect him to intervene in any particular case, I am only asking for fair play so that people who are living in appalling conditions are given the points they should get and that we cut out this nonsense. Will he give me an assurance, given that / am highlighting these cases, that he will examine the housing situation in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown housing authority?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asked by the Deputy was as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the way in which he ensures that housing authorities adhere to the letting priorities schemes approved by this Department, and his views on whether it is appropriate that housing authority does not allocate gross overcrowding points to a family who have to sleep on the living room floor due to the fact that there is no space available in the bedrooms.</P>
      <P>In the reply to the Question, I informed the Deputy that each housing authority is responsible for making a scheme of letting priorities to govern the letting of tenancies in its houses. Not all local authorities use the points system, although it is the one that is used by this authority. I am not familiar with its operation &ndash; it has never been used by any of the housing authorities of which I have been a member or which are in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The making or amendment of a scheme is a reserved function of the elected members of the authority under section 11 of the Housing Act, 1988, and is subject to the approval of the Minister to ensure the scheme is in accordance with statutory requirements and that all categories of need are covered by the scheme. This scheme was adopted by the elected members of the authority.</P>
      <P>Explanatory notes and guidelines were issued to housing authorities in 1989 on the making of such schemes. These advised housing authorities that it should be the aim of a scheme to promote equality of opportunity in getting access to local authority housing based on relative housing needs. Subject to compliance with section 11 and regard being had to the guidelines, it is a matter for each housing authority to determine the detailed criteria to be included in its scheme.</P>
      <P>The determination of priority in the allocation of a local authority house is a matter for the local authority in accordance with its scheme of letting priorities and I am precluded by statute from intervening in a way that might be construed as directing the letting of a house to a particular individual.</P>
      <P>My Department does not monitor or police how local authorities allocate tenancies in individual cases, nor would it be appropriate to do so as it would undermine the statutory responsibility of the local authority in this important regard. Moreover, I am statutorily barred from intervening to secure the allocation of local authority accommodation in any particular case.</P>
      <P>It is not, therefore, appropriate for me to intervene in any of the individual cases raised by the Deputy. Such instances should be taken up with the local authority&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann-Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue. I also thank the Minister for Education and Science for taking it. St. Mary's national school, Donnybrook, is a single stream co-educational school with a current enrolment of 274. The main school building was constructed in 1965 as a seven classroom school. An eighth classroom and a general purpose room were added in 1987. The original plan for the building did not envisage the demands of a modern school curriculum. The current implementation of an information communication technology plan is frustrated by the limitations of space available for installing technology and equipment in classrooms with large numbers of pupils.</P>
      <P>Serious circulation problems are posed by a lack of corridor provision. The school has eight mainstream teachers, one remedial teacher and one administrative principal. Arising from the lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio in 1999 the school is entitled to the appointment of a tenth assistant teacher. Unfortunately, it does not have the accommodation for this appointment. Previously, the school had to adapt a cloakroom to provide accommodation for a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>There is great demand for places in the school, but the site is restricted and, therefore, the school population cannot increase. Over the past number of years the school has had an excess of applicants for its junior infant class. In 1998 there were 63 applicants from the parish and 55 from outside. In 1999 the school received 60 applications from the parish and 56 from outside. Applications already received for 2000, 2001 and 2002 demonstrate a continuity in high numbers of parishioners applying for places.</P>
      <P>Ranelagh and Milltown parishes also expect the school to provide places because there are no Catholic schools in those areas. A chronic shortage of school places is a feature of life in Dublin south-east and, as a parent, I am familiar with this problem. The new specifications for primary schools include the provision of the following auxiliary accommodation &ndash; a resource library 70 square metres in area; a small multi-purpose room for conferences/medical examination and a remedial room for an administrative area of 30 square metres. St. Mary's national school lacks these amenities. It is also vital that a corridor is built. Currently pupils must in some cases pass through classrooms to move within the school structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An architect, Mr. Mark Cunningham, visited the school site yesterday to gain familiarity with and report on the site to the Department. The improvement plans have already been discussed with the school inspectors, Mr. Eamon Murtagh and Mr. Padraig Burns. The outline proposal has already been sent to the building unit in Tullamore. The school is seeking approval to move forward with its proposals and it is eager to work with architects approved by the Department, but to date it has not received a satisfactory response or had an opportunity to meet officials within the Department. It had expected a site visit or an <Col N="176" /> appointment to meet relevant officers in Tullamore.</P>
    <P>The staff of the school and the parents are eager to move ahead and cannot understand the long delay at this stage of the process. I ask the Minister to give this matter his full attention. In the past he has been amenable and my colleagues and I in Dublin South East have very much appreciated his co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding additional accommodation for St. Mary's national school. The school has a staffing level of a principal teacher, ten assistant teachers and a remedial teacher. The original seven classroom school was built in 1965 and one further classroom and a general purpose room were added in 1987. The school management has applied to my Department for additional classroom accommodation and a library/medical room. My Department's planning and building unit is currently assessing the future accommodation requirements of the school and an architectural assessment of the school building was carried out yesterday by a member of my Department's technical staff.</P>
      <P>On completion of a full assessment of the school's requirements, my Department will be in a position to progress the matter as quickly as possible. I fully appreciate the concerns of the school authorities in this matter and I assure the Deputy that it is the intention of my Department to provide adequate accommodation for the present and future needs of the school. The Deputy will appreciate that a large number of school building projects are on hand within my Department. Because of the priority which the Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools evident previously, the spending Estimates, which were recently published, show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, the burden of fund raising faced by schools and communities has been significantly reduced throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Consequently, more applications have been received and more projects have been dealt with than previously and that has created certain logjams in the process. However, I assure the Deputy that the application by St. Mary's will be dealt with as speedily as possible. He will appreciate that, at this early stage, it is not possible to outline the extent of the accommodation to be provided or when construction will commence. I will undertake to give the matter my personal attention so that progress can be maintained on this urgent need for accommodation given the circumstances outlined by the Deputy. We are aware that there are pressures on the school because of population growth and so on.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 November 1999.</P>

    <P>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern): I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 55 together.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to carry out an independent appraisal of the concept of, and the full implications of introducing a basic income payment to all citizens. The agreement provides that this will be overseen by a broadly-based steering group. The steering group is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, and comprises representatives of relevant Government Departments and the social partners. My Department is represented on the steering group. The Conference of Religious of Ireland, CORI, who have advocated basic income for some time, are also represented on the group.</P>
    <P>The steering group has decided to commission the necessary research in two phases. The first phase, which is now almost completed, examines the tax rate needed to fund basic income, and the distributional implications of introducing basic income with this tax rate. I also understand that the report from the second phase is expected within the next few months. This will cover the dynamic effects of the proposal, including its effects on employment, effects on economic growth, short and long-term budgetary implications and the gender dimensions of all of these. This research will inform any future developments, including the proposed Green Paper on Basic Income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy, was launched in April 1997 with the overall objective of significantly reducing the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>proportion of people in consistent poverty over a ten-year period. Much of the early work following the launch of NAPS was involved with setting up the structures necessary to support and oversee its implementation. There is now a set of struc<Col N="178" /> tures in place to ensure that the issue of social inclusion is central to policy formulation and implementation &ndash; from the high level strategic view to the ongoing co-ordination and executive functions necessary to ensure its ongoing implementation.</P>
    <P>In line with the principles of the Civil Service strategic management initiative, SMI, NAPS recognises the multi-faceted nature of the problem of social exclusion and, as such, the focus at all times is on a cross-departmental and integrated approach to tackling disadvantage. Each Department retains the lead role in progressing policies under its own areas. This cross-departmental approach is reflected in the mechanisms put in place to oversee the NAPS.</P>
    <P>Immediately on taking office, the Government established a Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach and including Ministers and Ministers of State from nine relevant Departments, which meets on a monthly basis. It provides an integrated basis for the Government's activities in the social inclusion area in general, ensuring that the strategic priorities are being pursued and that effective co-ordination takes place. As such it provides the essential political leadership necessary to advance the goals of NAPS. A senior officials group comprising high level civil servants from relevant Departments has also been set up to prepare the agenda and recommendations for the Cabinet committee. It is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental policy committee, originally established to develop the strategy, continues to meet four to five times per year and provides the principal strategic focus for the NAPS. It comprises senior civil servants as well as representatives of FÁS, Area Development Management Limited and the Combat Poverty Agency. It considers the ongoing progress on implementation of the strategy as well as progress towards achieving the NAPS targets. This committee remains the key agent for addressing central NAPS issues and agreeing future plans and programmes of activities. The IDPC is co-chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department.</P>
    <P>Each relevant Department has appointed a NAPS liaison officer who fulfils an important communication and co-ordination role within Departments. They act as a first point of contact in relation to NAPS issues within Departments and are supported by each Department's IDPC representatives as well as the senior officials group representative, where applicable. The Combat Poverty Agency is assigned a specific role in monitoring and evaluating the strategy as well as providing ongoing support and advice to the NAPS unit and Departments.</P>
    <P>A dedicated NAPS unit exists in my Department with responsibility for co-ordinating and developing cross-Departmental action in support of social inclusion initiatives. The unit also acts as a secretariat to the IDPC and liaises with all Government Departments, other agencies, both <Col N="179" /> national and international, and the social partners in promoting and progressing the strategy.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment to tackling social exclusion is clearly demonstrated in the wide range of institutional structures which have been established. The NAPS unit has a pivotal role to play in progressing the overall strategy and resourcing of the unit, including its staffing position, is kept under constant review by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 42 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country. Income adequacy is a concept which must be viewed in the context of the prevailing living standards enjoyed by the population as a whole. Accordingly, Government action is geared to ensuring that all relevant policy areas covering taxation, employment, social welfare, occupational pensions and others help those concerned to move out of poverty and live in a manner compatible with human dignity. This Government's commitment to social inclusion in the broad sense is evident in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within this framework, the social welfare system has a central role to play. This Government is committed to at least maintaining the value of social welfare payments in real terms and, indeed, <Col N="180" /> recent years have seen significant increases in excess of inflation. For example, between 1995 and 1998, social welfare payments increased by some 13% to 14% compared to a total rise in the consumer price index of less than 6% and an increase in gross average industrial earnings of about 11%. Furthermore, all social welfare rates are now at or above the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare meeting a key target of both Partnership 2000 and NAPS. We have recently reaffirmed our commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week and further undertaken to also increase the non-contributory pension to this level by 2002. In addition, we have committed ourselves to increasing all social welfare pensions for older people in line with average earnings over the lifetime of this Government. These actions have led to a tangible increase in the real incomes of those dependent on social welfare and have been a key contributory factor in reductions in deprivation and consistent poverty.</P>
    <P>Now that the Commission on Social Welfare recommendations have been achieved, it is timely that the future direction of social welfare rates is examined and various organisations have furnished their views on this issue. However, this is not a simple matter and each of the methods proposed carry their own particular implications, including potential employment and budgetary implications, which need to be carefully considered before any final decisions can be made. There may also be some methodological issues which would need to be addressed such as the availability of a readily accessible data for measurement purposes and the incorporation of secondary benefits into calculations of adequacy.</P>
    <P>The future direction of social welfare rates generally is under continuing review within my Department and all relevant research from the ESRI, Combat Poverty Agency and others such as the national pensions policy initiative will be taken into account in this regard. As indicated, this must also take account of the wider economic and financial implications as well as complementary developments in other areas of Government policy such as a national minimum wage and the employment action plan. This issue is also addressed by the NESC in its strategy document, Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice, which will be an important input into the discussions on a possible successor to Partnership 2000. No doubt, the outcome of these discussions will also be a significant contribution to considerations on social welfare policy and income adequacy in general.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 52 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April. In order to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme, the person must satisfy a means test. A substantial improvement in the means test was introduced by me in the 1999 budget. A person may now have a combined household income of up to £30 per week or savings/investments of up to £22,400 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20% in the last six years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £44.9 million in 1998. This year a sum of £46.4 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme. To increase the £5 fuel allowance to £15 per week would cost an estimated additional £75 million in the present fuel season. While the last increase in the fuel allowance was in October 1985, fuel price inflation has been much lower than general price inflation. The fuel and light component of the consumer price index, rose by 9.6% between August 1985 and August 1999.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation. In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £6 per week were paid from June 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs. There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by con<Col N="182" /> tacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre. Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment, ENP. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Any changes in the rate of payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I have examined with interest the budget proposals advanced by the Childcare 2000 campaign. The Government will take careful account of these proposals in developing the range of measures required to tackle the complex issues associated with childcare and child income support generally.</P>
      <P>While the list of measures advanced by the campaign includes, amongst other things, proposals for substantial investment in the provision of childcare facilities, the most significant measure they propose is the introduction of a new parent's childcare payment at an estimated net cost of £402 million.</P>
      <P>The campaign proposes that this new payment, which would be liable to taxation, would be payable to all parents regardless of labour force status. The campaign recommends that the payment should be payable at the rate of £20 per week per child aged up to five years of age and at the rate of £10 per week per child aged from six to 14 years of age.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the intention behind this proposal is to provide for an equitable means of meeting the childcare needs of all families. I am bound to say, however, that I have some misgivings about the impact, in particular on those families on the lowest incomes and who are dependent on welfare support, of the reduction in the rate of payment proposed when the child reaches the age of six and the complete withdrawal of the payment once the child reaches the age of 14.</P>
      <P>The need for a comprehensive approach to the issues of childcare and child income support is recognised on all sides of the House and the Government is examining all of the options available in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>In early 1998 my Department accepted an invitation from the Gardaí to participate in multi-agency vehicle checkpoints. These checkpoints involve staff from my Department participating with the Gardaí and officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in checking for compliance with the law in each of the areas concerned. The checkpoints proved to be effective in identifying areas of potential abuse which could be subsequently followed up. To copperfasten the legal basis of these operations provision was included in this year's Social Welfare Act to provide specific legal cover for officers of my Department participating in these checkpoints.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue, as circumstances allow, to participate in vehicle checkpoints as one element of its wide-ranging programme of control of fraud and abuse of social welfare payments. Clearly, because of the necessity of a Garda presence in these exercises the scheduling of checkpoints depends on the availability of gardaí having regard to their other commitments and other activities in which they are engaged. A number of issues in relation to the operation of the checkpoints have been raised on behalf of the staff involved in them and these are at present under discussion with the trade union concerned.</P>
      <P>From my Department's perspective participation in these checkpoints is just one measure in a wide range of activities designed to tackle abuse of the social welfare system. The activities include claim reviews, employer visitation for the purpose of inspecting PRSI records, data matching and other computer trawling exercises, liaison and transfer of information with other agencies in accordance with the law and special intensive team review activities on a local basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which was published in October 1998, a range of measures was introduced in the 1999 budget at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop <Col N="184" /> the position of carers. These measures were implemented between April and August this year. The provision in the Estimates for expenditure on carer's allowance in 1999 is almost £60 million which represents a 33% increase on expenditure in 1998. At the end of October 1999, there were 13,853 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance compared with 11,234 carers in receipt of the allowance at the same time last year.</P>
    <P>As pointed out in the review, it is difficult to estimate the number of full-time carers in the country. While care groups have estimated this figure to be around 100,000 carers it is not clear that all of these are time carers.</P>
    <P>Based on work in the review, the current figure is estimated to be around 50,000 covering carers of older people and adults and children with disabilities This figure is projected to increase considerably over time.</P>
    <P>Assuming that there are 50,000 full-time carers and taking account of the current numbers in receipt of the allowance, it is estimated that the complete abolition of the means test would cost over £150 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance noted that the allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need. The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget introduced some changes in the means test for carer's allowance. A disregard of £75 per week is applied to the income of a single carer and a disregard of £150 per week is applied to the joint means of a married couple.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme, published recently.</P>

      <Quest>the savings in unemployment assistance and benefit for each of the years from 1997 to date as a result of the progress to full employment; if these savings were returned to the Exchequer or re-deployed for other necessary measures by his Department; and his projections for the levels of unemployment supports needed in 2000 and 2001.</Quest>

      <P>The savings in unemployment assistance and benefit in each of the years 1997 to 1999 are contained in the tabular statement which I am making available to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment assistance is financed by the Exchequer and therefore the savings that arise on this scheme are available to finance improvements in other Exchequer funded schemes and <Col N="185" /> services. Unemployment benefit, on the other hand, is financed by PRSI contributions through the social insurance fund and the savings that arise on this scheme are available to finance improvements in other PRSI funded schemes.</P>
    <P>Over the 34 months period, from the beginning of January 1997 to the end of October 1999, the numbers on the live register decreased by 92,211. This was a very significant decrease, representing as it did, 34% of the total live register at the beginning of the period. Its achievement was due to the ongoing strong growth in the economy, improvements in my Department's employment support services and a programme of measures designed to reduce the level of fraudulent claiming of unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>Much of the decrease in the live register over the period in question was anticipated when the estimates for 1997, 1998 and 1999 were being framed. For example, the average live register on which the 1999 estimates were framed was 204,000. This compared with an actual average live register of 227,100 for 1998. This substantial decrease, amounting to 23,100, resulted in a reduction of around £85 million in the amount required for unemployment payments in 1999. In this way, it was possible in the 1999 budget to direct extra funding towards the less well off in society, through substantial increases in social welfare rates, including the £6 increase in personal rates for pensioners at age 66 and over, through significant improvements in carers allowance and through the introduction of the new schemes of farm assist, bereavement grant and the special 50% pensions for the self-employed.</P>
    <P>The actual performance of the live register this year has been even better than had been expected when the estimates were being framed and it is now forecast that the figure for the year will outturn at an average of around 195,000. It is this further decrease of 9,000 that is generating the bulk of the unemployment assistance and benefit savings which are emerging this year.</P>
    <P>The projected levels of unemployment supports needed in 2000 and 2001 are £653.3 million and £648.3 million, respectively, at present rates of payments. These figures break down between unemployment assistance and benefit as to £420.5 million and £232.8 million, respectively, in 2000 and as to £419.5 million and £228.8 million, respectively, in 2001. The live register estimates underlying these projections are 172,000 for 2000 and 169,000 for 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme people in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment can qualify for weekly supplements to meet certain needs such as the cost of rent or mortgage interest payments. This is generally intended as a short-term measure which is designed to provide immediate assistance for those in need. It is not intended as a general housing benefit and I have no plans to extend the SWA scheme in that regard.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full time employment. However, special arrangements were introduced some years ago to enable people making the</P>
      <P>transition from welfare to work to retain rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware that these arrangements are no longer fully adequate for some households, particularly for families with dependant children, given the large increases in housing costs in recent years.</P>
      <P>The conditions for retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements, including the income limits and the ceilings on the amounts payable, are currently being reviewed in consultation with the social partners under Partnership 2000. These discussions are aimed at developing cost-effective solutions to the employment trap to which the Deputy refers. Arising from these discussions, this matter will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible per<Col N="187" /> sons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources or to assist eligible home owners with the interest portion of their mortgage where an income need arises, for example through unemployment.</P>
    <P>Rent and mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent or the interest portion of the mortgage has an income equal to the SWA basic weekly payment rate, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent and mortgage interest levels for various household types as a basis for calculating the maximum amount of supplement payable in each area under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The maximum mortgage interest levels are the same as the rent levels in each health board. A supplement is payable on the interest portion of the mortgage only. Families can be paid up to £650 per month in a mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>The limits differ in each health board area as the rents charged for accommodation varies across each health board to reflect market forces and local conditions. These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of the actual fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. Health boards must satisfy themselves that accommodation is generally available within the limits which they set. As housing costs rise, levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement. For example, the Eastern Health Board is currently reviewing the maximum rent and mortgage interest limits which apply in its region and I expect that new limits will apply with effect from 1 January 2000.</P>
    <P>The health board has the discretion to award a supplement based on an amount of rent which exceeds the maximum level set where there are extenuating medical or social circumstances having regard to the applicant's means and all the other requirements of the legislation.</P>

      <P>There is no uncertainty regarding future funding of projects funded by my Department under the CDP. CDP projects are funded on the basis of three year, renewable contracts.</P>
      <P>The national development plan was published on Monday and contains a substantial commitment to social inclusion measures.</P>
      <P>The package reflects my own input, both in respect of issues relevant to my Department and in respect of wider issues as a member of the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion. In so far as the community development programme is concerned the plan contains, as I have already announced, an allocation of £100 million for the community development programmes operated by my Department. This is some £2 million initially and rises to some £4 million more per annum than the 1999 provision. The allocation will provide enhanced funding over the lifetime of the plan for the three programmes of core-funding for community development operated by my Department as follows: community development programme, family and community services resource centre programme, core funded community and family support groups programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Support for community development continues to be an integral part of the Government's overall social and economic development strategy.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent families under the tax and social welfare code was published in August of this year. The working group was chaired by my Department and comprised representatives from the Department of Finance, Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Revenue Commissioners, the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Social Services Board.</P>
      <P>The group examined a wide range of issues relating to the tax system and the social welfare system. While it failed to agree on the direction policy in these areas should take the group did undertake research and put forward a number of very radical suggestions for reform which have already given rise to much discussion and debate. I consider that the report of the working group makes a very useful contribution to the debate on the structure and objectives of our tax and social welfare systems and how these are adapting to meet the changes which are occurring in our society.</P>
      <P>The working group did put forward a number of proposals for examination which are relevant to my Department. These include increasing the rate at which the qualified adult allowance is paid to 70% of the personal rate, a restructuring of child benefit to give additional support during a child's early years, payments to lone parents and individualisation of the social welfare system. The suggestions relating to the qualified adult allowance and child benefit will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget. The issues raised by the working group in relation to payments to lone parents will be considered further in the context of a review of the one-parent family payment which has commenced under my Department's expenditure review programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> With regard to individualisation the working group recommended that that the existing administrative arrangements for separate payments should be made available on a more general basis subject to addressing the administrative and IT issues associated with this proposal. On a more general note the working group saw the expansion of the social insurance system as the vehicle for the establishment of direct rights which is in line with my own view. Much has already been accomplished in this area over the last ten years with the social insurance system expanded to include new groups of workers and measures also introduced to protect the records of people such as homemakers who take time out from the paid workforce for caring duties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under special arrangements which I introduced in 1998, the first £2,000 of payments under the rural environment protection scheme is disregarded, with the balance being assessed at 50% for means tested social assistance purposes. In <Col N="192" /> addition, any costs incurred by farmers in implementing the agri-environmental plan, as provided for under REPS, are also offset against other income from farming activities. These arrangements, which apply to farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and the old age non-contributory pension, were extended to the new farm assist scheme earlier this year. The above disregards also apply to payments arising under the scheme of compensation for compliance with special areas of conservation conditions, which is operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. These revised arrangements provide low income farmers with a significant financial incentive to participate in the REPS and SACs schemes, thereby benefiting the environment by the improvement of the sustainability of agriculture through the preservation and enhancement of the rural environment.</P>
    <P>The forest premium scheme is designed to replace farm income which is foregone through the change in the use of the land from ordinary farming activities to forestry. Unlike REPS and compensation payments under SACs, which compensate farmers for the material and work involved in complying with the agri-environmental plans or SAC conditions, payments under the farm forest premium scheme would equate to other forms of farm income. Accordingly, payments under the forest premium scheme are treated in the same way as other forms of farm income and are assessable for means tested social welfare purposes, that is, income from ordinary farm activities, headage payments, etc.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of the new farm assist scheme earlier this year, farm income, including payments under the forest premium scheme, are now assessed on a more favourable basis, that is, they are assessed at 80% rather than on a pound for pound basis. In the case of married old age non-contributory pensioners, all means, including forest premium payments, are assessed at 50%.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, there are no plans to extend the current disregards applying to REPS payments to payments under the forest premium scheme for means tested social welfare purposes.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is essentially a social welfare replacement income which is paid at a standard weekly <Col N="193" /> rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment. It is available to unemployed people, lone parents and people with a disability who have been in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months and who wish to pursue an approved second or third level course of education.</P>
      <P>The allowance has a number of unique features attaching to it. It is payable for the full duration of the course of study, including holiday periods. It is not a means tested scheme and, consequently, participants may take up part-time work without affecting their payment. In addition, participants receive a cost of education allowance of £200 which is payable at the beginning of each academic year and they also retain entitlement to any secondary benefits they had while in receipt of their relevant social welfare payment. Child care support has not been a feature of the back to education allowance scheme to date. The question of such support would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of other supports available to people in similar situations. In this regard the Department of Education and Science provides child care supports for people participating in certain educational programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was launched in April 1997 with the overall target of reducing the proportion of households in consistent poverty from 9% &ndash; 15% to less than 5% &ndash; 10% by 2007. Targets and objectives were also set in relation to each of the five key themes of unemployment, educational disadvantage, income adequacy, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first annual report of the NAPS Interdepartmental Policy Committee was launched in June of 1999 and contained a comprehensive overview of developments and progress in the social inclusion area. This report also detailed the substantial progress made to date towards achieving many of the original NAPS targets. In particular, the number of people in consistent poverty has been reduced from 9% &ndash; 15% to 7% &ndash; 10%, with the NAPS target of 5% &ndash; 10% by 2007 almost achieved; all social welfare payments are now at or above the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare; the level of unemployment has been reduced <Col N="194" /> from 11.9% in April 1996 to 5.7% for the period March to May 1999, already below the NAPS target of 6%; and the level of long-term unemployment has been reduced from 7% in April 1996 to less than 2.5% by March to May 1999, again below the NAPS target of 3.5%.</P>
    <P>In light of these developments, and as part of this Government's social inclusion strategy, I announced a revised target to reduce the numbers in consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004. In addition, the employment action plan contains a target to reduce unemployment to 5% and long-term unemployment to 2% by the end of the year 2000.</P>
    <P>I have also asked the NAPS IDPC to examine possibilities for new targets to reflect the changed environment &ndash;  for example in relation to education and adult literacy &ndash; and to consider setting targets in relation to particular groups such as children in poverty. I expect that the IDPC will consider a wide range of possible areas, including those referred to by the Deputy. It must be borne in mind that work on this complex matter is at a very early stage and it will be necessary to find a balance between the desirability of a wide range of targets to cover the complexity of social exclusion and the danger of losing focus if the net is cast too wide. No doubt, the national development plan and the outcome of the ongoing partnership negotiations will also inform this process.</P>
    <P>As regards an appropriate poverty line, the overall NAPS target is framed in terms of consistent poverty which is defined as being below 50% to 60% of average household income and experiencing enforced basic deprivation. The ESRI have stated that they consider this combined definition to be a better measure of poverty at any given point in time than using either element in isolation. However, it is common practice, to capture the complexity of the issue, to also examine the numbers falling below relative income poverty lines &ndash; without reference to deprivation &ndash; set at 40%, 50% and 60% of average household income.</P>
    <P>The future direction of social welfare rates generally is a matter which is under continuing consideration within my Department, particularly now that the minimum rates as recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare have been achieved. Various research presented by the ESRI, including monitoring poverty trends and review of the Commission on Social Welfare's minimum adequate income, as well as other work such as the national pension policy initiative's securing retirement income, various publications from the Combat Poverty Agency and a forthcoming strategy document from the National Economic and Social Council will all have an important role to play in the formulation of a future policy direction in this regard.</P>
    <P>Social exclusion is a broader issue than purely income levels, incorporating issues surrounding <Col N="195" /> ability to participate in the wider aspects of society. In this regard, issues such as education, healthcare, drugs, crime, sporting and cultural facilities are also of the utmost importance in ensuring that everyone has the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> The bonus payment was first introduced in December 1980 as a double payment, 100% bonus, and continued at that level until 1984. This was reduced to 75% in 1985 by the Labour-Fine Gael coalition and further reduced by them to 65% in 1986. The Fiánna Fail-Progressive Democrat coalition increased this to 70% from 1989.  </P>
    <P>An amount of £42 million is provided in my Department's 1999 estimates to provide for payment of a Christmas bonus for approximately 705,000 recipients of long-term social welfare payments including the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>This estimate is based on the payment of a bonus in 1999 similar to the bonus paid in 1998 and earlier years i.e. 70% of the person's normal weekly payment subject to a minimum payment of £20.</P>
    <P>The bonus will be paid to recipients of the following payments: disablement pension, death benefit, by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory, pension, pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one parent family payment, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, disability allowance, farm assist and payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>Entitlement conditions remain unchanged from last year and comprehensive instructions for staff are in the course of preparation and will issue shortly.</P>
    <P>I assume that the confusion referred to by the Deputy relates to difficulties concerning health boards making standardised payments in respect of the additional needs people have at Christmas time. Health boards are empowered, and indeed are obliged, to make once-off payments to people who are faced with an exceptional need, including the additional costs which arise at Christmas time. Clarification issued at that time to ensure that all supplementary welfare allowance recipients received their full entitlements at Christmas time in a fair, equal, consistent and timely manner. This positive policy will also apply this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to a millennium benefit to enhance the lives of social welfare claimants, as indicated in the Government's review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, social inclusion remains the primary economic goal of this Government going forward into the millennium. In particular, the Government are committed to achieving full employment with unemployment well below 5% by 2002; increasing all pensions for older people &ndash; including widow's and non-contributory old age pensions &ndash; to £100 per week by 2002; increasing all pensions in line with average industrial earnings over the lifetime of the Government; achieving a co-ordinated approach to addressing the needs of carers; addressing the child support needs of all families and child poverty.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement issued expeditiously having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply to the different schemes.</P>
      <P>In the Social Welfare Act, 1999, I introduced a number of very significant improvements to the carer's allowance scheme and also introduced the new farm assist scheme which is aimed at providing income support to farm families. In the case of disability allowance provided for the retention of entitlement to the allowance by recipients who enter full-time institutional care or who are hospitalised.</P>
      <P>The numbers of people being catered for by these schemes have increased significantly. The numbers in receipt of disability allowance have increased from 34,500 when the scheme transferred to my Department from the health boards in 1996 to approximately 50,000 at present.</P>
      <P>With regard to carer's allowance all the improvements to the scheme have been fully implemented and the necessary arrangements have been put in place to process the additional applications resulting from those improvements. There are now 13,853 persons in receipt of carer's allowance compared to 1,234 in the same period in 1998. With regard to farm assist 9,186 applications have been received, and there are currently 6,872 claims in payment.</P>
      <P>Applications in respect of all these schemes are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible, having regard to the means and, in some cases, medical eligibility criteria that apply.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the addition of a substantial number of new claims affects the time taken to process claims generally, my understanding, however, is that there have not been significant additional delays in the processing of applications for these schemes.</P>

Up to 12 November 1999, 2,478 new applications for farm assist had been received from persons not in receipt of an existing payment. The total number of applications for farm assist received by that date was 9,202.</P>
      <P>Of the claims which have already been processed the majority have had an increase in their level of payment.

In many of these cases the means had not been reviewed for a considerable period prior to the introduction of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme has brought about a significant improvement in the incomes of smallholders, many of whom were not previously in receipt of any social welfare payment.

      <P>Family income supplement is a weekly employment support payment for families who are in employment and on low incomes. To qualify for family income supplement the average weekly income of the household must be below the prescribed income limit which varies with the family size. The rate of family income supplement payable is 60% of the difference between the average family income and the prescribed income limit for that family. These income limits, vary from £220 a week for a one-child family to £359 for a family with eight or more children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To enhance the value of this scheme and in accordance with a commitment given in Partnership 2000, I gave priority attention to reforming the family income supplement scheme. This included raising the relevant income limits and making provision for the assessment of income for family income supplement purposes on a net income basis. This change which was effected in October 1998 has already had a very positive effect on the number of families qualifying for family income supplement. At September 1998 <Col N="199" /> prior to the move to calculation on a net income basis there were 12,973 family income supplement recipients. At 30 September 1999 there were 14,589 in receipt of family income supplement, an increase of 12.5%. I am confident that the numbers availing of family income supplement, will continue to increase in the short to medium term.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce different systems of payment of social welfare which differentiate between people on grounds of their nationality. In my view, the level of support provided and the method through which that support is provided should be determined by the circumstances of the individual case, not by the person's nationality.</P>
      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy has in mind the position of asylum seekers in relation to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. At present, the basic needs of asylum seekers are met through the SWA scheme. The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department and provides entitlement to any persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, regardless of their nationality.</P>
      <P>The Government announced recently that asylum seekers may in future have their needs met by direct provision. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is developing proposals in that regard. The objective is to see if the particular needs of asylum seekers, e.g., education, medical and material needs, can be met in a more efficient, co-ordinated, manner. This approach should reduce the extent to which asylum seekers need to claim supplementary welfare allowance to meet their basic needs.</P>

      <P>Following on the extension of Class A PRSI to community employment workers in 1996, the position is that CE workers are treated in the same way as other Class A workers in so far as social insurance entitlements are concerned. CE workers who revert to the live register after completing a period on a CE scheme may, therefore, by virtue of having paid Class A PRSI contributions, qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance. As a consequence, they are not entitled to the social welfare secondary benefits which are payable only with long-term welfare payments.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit. Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>I have explained to the House on many occasions that I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for CE workers who qualify for unemployment benefit without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients. Any such concessions could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme was introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well-off students who are unable to get summer jobs and who are debarred from claiming unemployment assistance during the summer holiday period. In my reply to Deputy Broughan on 2 June last I referred to the issue of additional work for students availing of the scheme. My intention was to convey the fact that students can undertake additional work after they have completed their period on the student's scheme. Many students do in fact take on summer jobs after they have finished on the scheme.</P>
      <P>The focus of the scheme has always been on students who cannot find summer work. The wider availability of summer jobs in recent years has meant a lower level of recourse to the scheme. This year some 9,200 students participated in the scheme, a 33% reduction on the 1998 figure.</P>

      <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as a vehicle for the delivery of child income support is recognised on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>It is reflected also in the substantial investment the Government makes in the scheme, at a full year cost of around £475 million per annum. The last budget provided for increases in child benefit of £3 per month for each of the first two children in a family and £4 per month for the third and subsequent children. This brought the monthly rates payable from September 1999 up to £34.50 and £46, respectively.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is effective in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families most in need and is of particular importance to families on low incomes. As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits, such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>A blueprint for the development of occupational pensions was set out by the Pensions Board in its report, Securing Retirement Income, on the national pensions policy initiative. At the time of the publication of the report in May 1998, I set out the Government's response in Action on Pensions, a copy of which was furnished to each Deputy. This response welcomed the broad thrust of the proposals in the occupational area and established working groups to examine these further with a view to implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interdepartmental working groups are currently examining: the introduction of a personal retirement account &ndash; this group is chaired by my Department and I expect to receive a report before the end of the year; tax issues in relation to occupational pensions generally &ndash; the group is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives of my Department, issues in relation to this group are, therefore, a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance; and the partial pre-funding of social welfare and public service pensions on foot of the Government's decision in July to adopt this approach. As this group is chaired by the Department of <Col N="203" /> Finance, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department is actively involved in all these working groups.</P>
    <P>On further enhancement of the national pensions environment and in line with the national pensions policy initiative recommendations, in the 1999 Social Welfare Act, I provided for the board's recommendation to prohibit reductions in occupational pensions already in payment, arising from increases in social welfare pensions.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations relating to access, vesting, preservation and revaluation of occupational pensions are also being examined and developed by the Department, in consultation with the Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>I will also be considering reports from the board in relation to the treatment of pension scheme surpluses, equal treatment and the compensation fund. Legislative effect will be given to these and other recommendations contained in the national pensions policy initiative report in a comprehensive occupational pensions Bill which I propose to introduce as soon as possible next year.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme applies to persons in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. To be eligible, a person must be living alone or with persons who come within certain categories and must also satisfy a means test. The means condition currently applied is that any additional household income, over the relevant maximum pension rate, must not exceed £30 per week.</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension recipients may, subject to certain conditions, take up rehabilitative work or training. Where this takes the form of participation on a community employment scheme, they receive the basic weekly community employment rate of payment of £92.75 in addition to their invalidity pension entitlement. They also retain entitlement to free telephone rental allowance, free electricity allowance, free television licence and free travel. Where necessary, unrestricted travel passes are issued to enable invalidity pension recipients to travel to their place of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> The position with regard to the fuel allowance is that the £30 limit on additional income over the basic pension is applied to all income including the community employment payment. In this way pensioners taking up community employment are treated similarly to pensioners who take up any other form of employment. The provisions regard to pensioners taking up rehabilitation employment are, however, being reviewed at present and the provisions in relation to the retention of secondary benefits will be reviewed in that context.</P>

      <P>This change, which was introduced in October 1998, has already had a very positive effect on the number of families qualifying for this supplement.

      <P>Patentable subject matter is already dealt with under Article 27 of the TRIPS agreement. Article 27 (3)(b) permits WTO members to exclude from patentability plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and microbiological processes. This is subject to a requirement that members provide for the protection of plant varieties either by patents or by an effective <i>sui generis</i> system or by a combination of both. I assume that the Deputy is referring to these provisions when referring to biopatents.</P>
      <P>Article 27 (3)(b) contains a review clause and work on this review has already commenced within the WTO TRIPS council. It is expected that the third WTO ministerial conference in Seattle will take the necessary decisions to launch a millennium round of trade negotiations across a broad range of trade issues.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 85, 90 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> I accept that there are a number of deficiencies in the ewe premium system. One of the deficiencies which has been identified is its failure to take account of the fact that prices are much higher in some member states than others. To introduce more equity into the system, I have suggested that a supplementary ewe premium should be introduced in member states where market prices remain consistently below the EU average by a certain percentage. Such an arrangement would provide some assurance to producers that they will be protected from the consequences of difficult market situations. This proposal has not been accepted by the Commission or other member states in the past both because of the cost involved and because of the concern that such a system could be used by Irish processors as an effective export subsidy on the EU market.</P>
    <P>Another deficiency in the ewe premium system is the non-payment of an extensification premium on ewes in spite of the fact that they are included in the calculation of stocking density for the premium. The Commission view on this issue is that the rural world premium takes the place of the extensification premium in the sheep sector and, accordingly, that there is no justification for its introduction.</P>
    <P>I have made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler over the years and most recently earlier this week on the need for the sheepmeat regime to be reformed to address these issues. Apart from the UK, there was no support from other member states. The Commissioner indicated that they intend to review the current regime next year. I intend to press the Commission on these issues.</P>
    <P>Finally, I also wish to point out that payments to sheep farmers including premiums and headage in 1999 and which make an important contribution to sheep farmers incomes are expected to amount to almost £130 million.</P>

      <P>The land in question was re-classified from mountain to lowland in 1996 following a survey of the area. The applicant was therefore not paid sheep headage grants on mountain ewes in 1998 and 1999 because it is a condition of the sheep headage scheme that mountain breeding ewes must be substantially maintained on mountain grazings. However, I am having this particular case re-investigated in view of the fact that the person concerned was not a first time applicant for sheep headage in 1998 and was not notified of the change in the classification of the land in question. I will revert to the Deputy as soon as the investigation is completed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the publication of the spending Estimates for 2000 last week, I announced the allocation of £3 million revenue funding and £3 million capital funding next year for the commencement of a programme for the development of renal dialysis services. This programme, which I hope will be completed over three years at an estimated total cost of £20 million, will be aimed at achieving a structured enhancement of the capacity of the system to meet existing and anticipated growth in demand for renal services over the coming years. It will ensure the equitable availability of treatment choices for dialysis patients thoughout the country. Next year's investment will be primarily directed at addressing immediate requirements that are apparent from my Department's review of services in the area. In tandem with this, my Department will be engaging in further detailed consultations with all relevant interests and further examining the epidemiology of end-stage renal failure with a view to informing the most effective investment of further resources in subsequent years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the waiting list for vascular surgery, I have since coming into office taken an integrated approach to tackling the overall problem that is involved. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies who achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report. I am confident that the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represents the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provide for notification to and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services. Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service, rather than to register. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
      <P>The number of notifications received by the health boards to date is 2,882. The number of inspections including first and second annual inspections carried out to date is as follows:</P>

    <P>Precise information on the number of pre-school providers who have not complied with the notification requirements is difficult to compile. Health boards continue to take steps to pursue non-notifiers and notifications to the health boards are ongoing.</P>
    <P>The requirement to reduce places is mainly related to the availability of adequate space per child in the premises and-or the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times. A reduction in the number of places is not necessarily recommended following inspection.</P>
    <P>Where deficiencies are identified, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner to make specific improvements in a planned way provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. The plan may include a reduction in numbers achieved through natural reduction, that is, not replacing <Col N="219" /> children who leave during the year, reducing numbers on a phased basis, reducing numbers at the beginning of the next school year or the provider moving to a larger premises. The timescale for making improvements varies from a requirement for immediate action to a phased implementation which may extend to six months.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Partnership 2000 Expert Working Group on Child Care under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, examined the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a child care infrastructure. The report of the group was launched on 3 February 1999. Following publication of this report the Government established an interdepartmental committee on child care chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report and the child care proposals in an Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education. The report of the committee has been noted by Government which has referred the report for consideration to a ministerial group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of drugs and medicines (ex-manufacturer) in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Irish Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. The purpose of these agreements with the industry is to ensure that the most modern medicine therapies are available to patients at reasonable prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> The current agreement, which covers the period 1 August 1997 to 31 July 2002 provides that the price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not exceed the currency adjusted United Kingdom wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. The agreement, and indeed the previous agreement for the period 1993-97, also provides for a price freeze on the wholesale cost of drugs and medicines to the Irish market. In effect, therefore, at the end of the current agreement, a price freeze will have been in place for ten years.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to retail costs of general medical services prescriptions and private prescriptions is as follows. Arrangements are negotiated with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union for the supply of medicines to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme. Under the general medical services scheme, pharmacists are reimbursed the trade price, ingredient cost of the drugs, medicines and appliances dispensed by them plus the appropriate dispensing fee and VAT where applicable.</P>
    <P>The cost of private prescriptions to patients covers the ingredient cost of the medicine, the retail mark-up on the ingredient cost, normally 50%, a standard fee and VAT where applicable. One exception is the high tech scheme where a capitation rate applies. My Department has no function in determining the retail mark-up on private dispensing of medicines, which has been established by custom and practice.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, in general, the current IPHA agreement, which is the main control in place with regard to drug prices, is working well.</P>

      <P>The proposal for a national environmental health action plan which I published recently suggests that the setting up of an environmental health <Col N="221" /> directorate within the Environmental Protection Agency be considered.</P>
      <P>The proposed national plan was circulated to Departments and agencies with an involvement in environmental health and to all health boards and local authorities. After comments have been received and reviewed I will submit a formal plan to Government next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Disease surveillance units are long established in many countries and have demonstrated the importance of analysis of national disease patterns for the development of strategies to control communicable diseases.</P>
      <P>The national disease surveillance centre was established in October 1998. Initially, it will be responsible for the surveillance of communicable diseases, such as meningitis, tuberculosis and foodborne diseases such as salmonella and e.coli O157. Its functions include collaboration with and supporting the health boards in the control of infectious disease, the development of guidelines and protocols and undertaking research.</P>
      <P>The centre will also collaborate closely with other units and agencies in the country such as my Department, hospital consultant microbiologists and consultants in infectious diseases, environmental health officers, veterinarians and the Food Safety Authority. It will also establish links with national disease surveillance bodies in other countries to ensure the exchange of latest knowledge and research outcomes.</P>
      <P>The funding allocated to the centre will be increased substantially in the coming year to enable its activities to be expanded. Ten staff have been recruited to date and it is planned that further specialist medical, scientific, IT and clerical staff will be appointed in 2000.</P>
      <P>The centre has been established on a non-statutory basis initially under the auspices of the Eastern Health Board. I anticipate bringing forward proposals in the course of next year for the establishment of the centre on a statutory basis.</P>

      <P>The health boards are statutorily responsible for the control and prevention of infectious disease. They are required to take such steps as are necessary or desirable for investigating the nature and source of any such infection, for preventing its spread and for removing conditions favourable to such infection. These principles would be applicable to the management of any occurrence of tuberculosis in a school setting.</P>
      <P>The report of the working party on tuberculosis, which was published in 1996, contained detailed recommendations in relation to tuberculosis screening, including where the disease is detected in school pupils.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recent outbreak in the Southern Health Board area, I have received a preliminary report from the board and this indicates that screening and treatment is being provided as necessary.</P>

      <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I have made inquiries of the <Col N="225" /> Western Health Board about the matter raised by the Deputy. The board has informed me that the additional information referred to is sought only in cases where the children vaccinated were not originally registered with the GP in question, for example, returned emigrants, families relocating from other areas or families choosing to have a GP other than their nominated GP administer the vaccine. This ensures that where children have come from outside the board's area, vaccinations previously administered to them will be on record. The board has indicated that the collection of additional information in these cases enhances the accuracy of uptake statistics and ensures accurate payment to GP's for vaccinations given.</P>

      <P>For a product to be available to medical card holders on the general medical services scheme, it must satisfy a number of criteria, including that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public. Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that do not satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over-the-counter, and may be advertised directly to the public. Accordingly, they are not included in the list of items reimbursable under the common list.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government recently launched the cardiovascular health strategy Building Healthier Hearts. I have taken particular note of the recommendation in the report that there is a role for nicotine replacement therapy as one part of the overall fight against smoking. I recognise that measures must be strengthened to enable people wanting to kick the habit, to do so. I have asked the advisory forum to the heart health task force to bring forward to me proposals on how we can make available nicotine replacement therapy for medical card users as a matter of urgency as one part of the overall fight against smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's health promotion unit conducts national multi-media anti-smoking campaigns to encourage smokers to give up and non-smokers to refrain from taking up the habit. The most recent anti-smoking campaign Break the Habit for Good was launched in December 1998 and this campaign takes a slightly different approach to previous campaigns. It emphasises the positive effects which quitting smoking can have on the individual and offers support in the form of an Advice Kit which in turn offers the support of the Irish Cancer Society's helpline. The campaign con<Col N="226" /> tinues, by a series of national and local initiatives, to offer help and support for those people wishing to give up smoking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, my predecessor announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two central units located at St. Vincent's Hospital and at the Mater Hospital, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach. In addition, the use of mobile units by BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Board, will ensure that the screening service is accessible to all women in the target age <Col N="229" /> group in these areas. My intention is to provide a top quality service which meets best international standards. I am satisfied that the careful planning and deliberation by the national breast screening committee over the past two years in relation to all aspects of the programme will ensure that we can offer a service which is underpinned by standards of excellence and one which will ultimately pay dividends in terms of reductions in mortality among women in the target population.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and the importance of ensuring that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. I am very aware of the unnecessary trauma and anguish that could be caused to women and their families as a result of mistakes in an organised screening programme. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
    <P>Specifically the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors, the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population, the ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective and the availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    <P>In March 1999, I announced the start up date of the programme as October 1999 and I am pleased to say that this target date has been met. The planning and design of both centres is almost complete and I understand that consent letters have now been issued to women on a batch basis. The essential staff to commence the high quality programme have now been recruited. State of the art equipment and an information technology system have also been purchased. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>My Department is very conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. For this reason, I have requested the National Cancer Forum to undertake a review of symptomatic breast cancer services at national level prior to the commencement of phase I of the national breast screening programme and to report back to the Department as soon as possible in the matter.</P>
    <P>In tandem with this, my Department recently raised the issue of mammography referral practices with the health boards. The key concern is to ensure that all women, irrespective of age or where they live have timely access to symptomatic services. A critical factor in this regard is referral by GPs to local diagnostic mammography services in the first instance. This should result in a reduction in average waiting times at all mam<Col N="230" /> mographic units, thereby improving access for women and at the same time ensuring that expertise levels are maintained and developed in diagnostic units around the country.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy has been approved by the Eastern Health Board for a nursing home subvention of £120 per week to be utilised in the private nursing home of his choice. He is currently a patient in Hampstead Hospital which is a private psychiatric hospital, registered in accordance with the mental treatment Acts. Unfortunately, he cannot avail of the subvention in Hampstead Hospital as it is not registered in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to the Adjournment debate on Wednesday 29 September, the matter has been referred to the Eastern Health Board for investigation. I understand from the board that a possible option would be to transfer the patient to either Elmhurst or the Alzheimer Care Centre, both of which are on the same campus as Hampstead Hospital, and both of which attract nursing home subvention. This would allow the patient to remain in the same location-environment and result in a reduction in the financial burden on the family. This transfer would be subject to the medical care needs of the patient being appropriate to either Elmhurst or the Alzheimer Care Centre.</P>

The administration of the order is a matter for the local authority. The amount of compensation payable by local authorities for land acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed compulsory purchase order is a matter for negotiation between the local authority and the property owners concerned. In the event of dispute either party has recourse to the land values reference committee for the appointment of an official property arbitrator to determine the case.</P>

Works to private houses may be funded only where failure to do so would either prevent the carrying out of necessary work to the rented houses, or would give an unacceptable or incongruous result to the estate as a whole. In such cases the maximum contribution under the scheme is 50% of the cost of eligible works. As 16 of the 18 dwellings at Ballybough Street are private, Kilkenny Corporation's proposals were not eligible for funding under the remedial works scheme.</P>

    <P>Local authorities are responsible for operating this scheme in their own areas, for assessing eligibility, deciding on the works to be carried out and for payment of the cost of the works to the house. Beneficiaries are required to make weekly or monthly repayments to the local authority in respect of the local authority's costs for a <Col N="234" /> maximum of 15 years or when the aggregate of the payments made equals the amount of the loan whichever is the sooner. The charge is set by the local authority and is calculated in much the same way as differential rents for local authority tenants, that is on the basis of income-ability to pay and the cost of the works involved. As the terms of the scheme already take into account ability to pay, I have no plans to revise the terms of the scheme in this regard.</P>

      <P>An amount of £42 million is provided in my Department's 1999 estimates to provide for payment of a Christmas bonus for approximately 705,000 recipients of long-term social welfare payments including old-age pensioners.</P>
      <P>This estimate is based on the payment of a bonus in 1999 similar to the bonus paid in 1998 and earlier years, that is 70% of the person's normal weekly payment subject to a minimum payment of £20.</P>
      <P>The Christmas bonus is applicable to recipients of the following long-term social welfare payments: disablement pension, death benefit, by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pension; retirement pension; invalidity pension; widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory pension; pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance; one parent family payment; unemployment assistance at the long-term rate; disability allowance; payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
      <P>Any change in the Christmas bonus or the provision of special bonus to mark the millennium would have substantial cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of other priorities and commitments.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy is no doubt aware as indicated in the Government's review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, social inclusion remains the primary economic goal of this Government going forward into the millennium. In particular, the Government is committed to increasing all pensions for older people &ndash; including widow's and non-contributory old age pensions &ndash; to £100 per week by 2002; and increasing all pensions in line with average industrial earnings over the lifetime of the Government</P>

      <P>Disability allowance is a weekly payment which is payable to people who satisfy the medical conditions of the scheme, are aged between 16 and 66, and who satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>In common with other means tested payments, the position currently is that any income earned by the spouse of a disability allowance claimant from employment as a home help is not taken into account for the purposes of determining entitlement to a qualified adult allowance.</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension is an insurance-based payment payable to claimants who are regarded as permanently incapable of work and who satisfy the relevant PRSI contribution conditions. In determining whether a qualified adult allowance is payable to claimants of invalidity pension, account is taken of spousal earnings from any source.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the treatment of spousal income as between invalidity pension and disability allowance is not comparable as spousal income impacts on the level of the personal rate payable in respect of the means tested disability allowance payment, while spousal income has no impact on the personal rate of invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>In cases where the earnings of the spouse of a claimant of invalidity pension exceeds the specified limit, currently £60 per week, for payment of a qualified adult allowance, it may be that the claimant would be better off on disability allowance. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, perhaps he would provide me with the relevant details, and my Department can arrange to have this issue investigated.</P>

      <P>The one-parent family payment is a social assistance scheme whose main objective is to provide financial support for lone parents who are bringing up children on their own. In common with other social assistance schemes the OFP features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. The means test associated with the OFP operates broadly along the same lines as other social assistance schemes. However, there are major differences in the treatment of earnings under the OFP means test because of particular policy objectives associated with that scheme.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the most effective route out of poverty for lone parents is through paid employment. Accordingly, the policy is to encourage and facilitate lone parents in moving into the paid labour force so that they may avoid long-term welfare dependency. The earnings disregard of £115.38 per week is the main element of this policy and it is designed to recognise the additional costs which a lone parent may face in moving into employment and to ensure that the financial implications of making such a move are straightforward and easily understood by lone parents. Treating other income in the same way as earnings would not be in keeping with this policy objective.</P>

      <P>The latest number of persons who are on the live register was published by the CSO at the end of October. This <Col N="237" /> showed that there were 177,945 persons on the live register at that time.</P>
      <P>The live register is not, as the CSO states, designed to measure the level of unemployment in that it includes, for example, part-time workers, seasonal and casual workers who are entitled to an unemployment payment. Unemployment is measured by the quarterly national household survey and the latest figure for March-May 1999 is 96,900 unemployed. The CSO estimate that the standardised unemployment rate is 5.2% which is the lowest rate since the current method of measurement was introduced.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that there is considerable tightness in many sectors of the labour market and my Department is actively involved, in co-operation, where appropriate, with FÁS, in helping to direct people to available opportunities. With the introduction of the employment action plan in September 1998, the level of co-ordination between my Department and FÁS, which has primary responsibility for job placement, has been considerably enhanced. Furthermore, my Department, through its locally based jobs facilitators has taken a considerable number of initiatives aimed at matching employers and job-seekers.</P>
      <P>Despite the fall in unemployment in recent years, there are still significant numbers of unemployed people who have yet to benefit from the growth in employment. More than one third of those in receipt of unemployment assistance have been unemployed for three years or more. While a wide range of supports is available, it remains to be seen if the very considerable disadvantages facing those people can be fully met by the current range and level of services provided by State agencies.</P>

    <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board, 1993 stated that the facility for using pre-1953 contributions will end naturally at the end <Col N="246" /> of the contribution year 2002-03. Some 59,000 people receive reduced rate or pro-rata, e.g. EU-Reciprocal Agreement, pensions under the old age contributory and retirement pensions schemes and all may potentially have some contributions in the pre-1953 era. The estimated full-year cost of extending a maximum rate pension to all of this group is £24 million.</P>

Issues relating to a number of other sections of the Bill have also been raised.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the number of site assessments to be carried out by Dúchas in counties Sligo and Leitrim as a planning permission requirement; the reason for the backlog; the steps she has in place to address this matter; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1994 Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, as amended, planning authorities are obliged to notify certain prescribed bodies of planning applications received by them, depending on the nature and effects of the proposed development on the interests of the body concerned. My Department, as the State authority charged with the protection and conservation of the nation's natural and built heritage, is one of the prescribed bodies. Where such applications are referred to my Department they are assessed by Dúchas, the heritage service, whose views are conveyed to the planning authority where they are so warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> The number of planning applications assessed by the national monuments and historic properties division and the national parks and wildlife division of Dúchas each year since 1995 was approximately 2,600, 2,900, 3,800, 5,800 and 5,900 (to mid-November 1999) respectively. This represents a 127% increase over the last five years and is as a result of the growth in the economy over the same period as well as an increased awareness of heritage matters generally. Inevitably in such situations backlogs of work will arise and while every effort is made to clear them as quickly as possible it is not always possible to do so. The staffing needs of the Department are continuously under review to ensure the optimum deployment of staff resources and I am aware the staffing needs of these areas are being reviewed at present. The number of planning applications for counties Leitrim and Sligo assessed by the two divisions in the same period are 190, 280, 330, 390 and 310 (to mid-November 1999) respectively. There are about 140 planning applications for these two counties currently waiting assessment.</P>
    <P>Where a proposed development would impact on an area of heritage importance, Dúchas may have no objection to the proposed development; or recommend to the planning authority the incorporation of conditions in the grant permission that would address their concerns in relation to this site; or, object to the proposed development and recommend to the planning authority the refusal of planning permission.</P>
    <P>It is a matter solely for the planning authority to decide whether or not to accept such recommendations and I would hope that the planning authority in their decision would address any concerns raised with them by Dúchas.</P>
    <P>Where a planning authority, in deciding to grant permission for a proposed development, incorporate conditions recommended by Dúchas, it is a matter for that planning authority to ensure the developer complies with such conditions. As planning permissions are valid for five years Dúchas does not have details of the number of such assessments outstanding at any time and the Deputy may be able to obtain such information from the respective planning authorities.</P>

      <P>A number of staffing issues concerning this section of Dúchas, the heri<Col N="249" /> tage service of my Department including the issue of persons engaged on temporary contracts for service, are currently under discussion within the normal Civil Service industrial relations framework and I would not like to make any statement on the matter that might prejudice the outcome of these discussions. Accordingly, until these outstanding issues are resolved it is not possible to address the question of employing additional staff. As an interim measure many contracts are being renewed on a three-monthly basis. The legal position is that those engaged on a contract for service are not employees and consequently have no claim to permanent status.</P>

This appraisal included an evaluation of the methodology and findings of the case made as well as other considerations such as the optimum size of a cablecar, maintenance, general efficiency, current costs, capital costs, level of income likely to be generated and an effective administrative structure for the operation of the proposed cablecar system.</P>
      <P>The result of this study showed the provision of a cablecar as being feasible and of economic benefit to the island and to the development of the region in general.</P>

      <P>Agreement, in principle, has been reached with the music industry to jointly fund a non-statutory music board to promote and develop the indigenous music industry as recommended in the FORTE report. It is envisaged that the board will be operational in early 2000. The board, when established, will be charged with drawing up a five year strategic plan for the industry, and the provision of infrastructure for the industry including world class recording studios for performing artists, will be among the many issues to be addressed by the board.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the terms of the Registration of Title Act, 1965, which requires county councils to compulsorily register any property valued above a specified figure, is interfering with the application of the shared ownership scheme (details supplied); if he will consider taking steps to revise the threshold figure at which this requirement comes into operation to a figure reflecting current property values; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Section 23 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, provides that regis<Col N="251" /> tration of the ownership of land shall be compulsory where the land is acquired by a local authority. It applies to all such property irrespective of its value.</P>
      <P>Rule 19 of the Land Registration Rules 1972 as amended by the rules of 1972, 1977 and 1981 provides for a simplified ownership registration process by a statutory authority. A county council can, therefore, register ownership on foot of a certificate from their solicitor in lieu of and in modification of the official examination of title by the Land Registry. This simplified process can only apply in cases where the purchase money or compensation does not exceed £50,000. The registration of title rules committee is, I understand, currently reviewing this threshold with a view to revising the figure to a level commensurate with current property values. I expect the results of this review to be available shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to the case mentioned by the Deputy, the Land Registry does not at present have any record of an application for registration of this particular property.</P>

      <P>The proposals in that Bill are wide-ranging and take into account the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee report on liquor licensing, the Competition Authority and submissions which my Department received from the public and relevant interest groups in relation to those recommendations. The Bill will cover licences, hours of trading, the law in relation to registered clubs, additional measures to combat under-age drinking, and offences for breaches of licensing laws generally. My detailed proposals in relation to the Bill were approved by the Government on 12 October, 1999 for formal drafting and I can say that it is my intention to have the Bill published as soon as possible in the early part of 2000.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities who have informed me that the current personnel strength of Carbury Garda station, as of October 1999 is one sergeant and one garda.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the Garda station opens from 4.00 pm &ndash; 6.00 pm on Monday, Thursday and Saturdays and from 10.00 am &ndash; 1.00 pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Fridays. When unmanned, the &ldquo;Greenman&rdquo; facility and telephone call diversion system linked to the district headquarters at Kildare comes into operation. I am further informed that members attached to Carbury and Robertstown Garda stations have joint use of the official vehicle allocated to Robertstown and this is utilised in patrolling the sub-district. The reason that transport is shared between both Garda stations is to maximise Garda resources. This patrolling is also augmented as necessary by other resources from within Carlow-Kildare Garda division.</P>

      <Col N="253" /> There are nine official vehicles allocated to Kildare district and these resources are utilised at the discretion of the district officer, depending on the operational requirements in the district.

      <P>It has been policy of my Department, for some time, not to provide direct financial support for tourist accommodation projects, on the basis of the proven ability of the commercial accommodation sector to respond, without grant assistance, to growth in visitor numbers.</P>
      <P>This approach was incorporated into the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-1993, agreed with the European Commission and, by and large, carried forward into the current operational programme. The current programme did make an exception in the case of a number of specific market segments by providing for limited grant aid for certain specialist accommodation where the quality of existing accommodation was recognised to be deficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas would have qualified for generous tax reliefs under that scheme. In addition, the 1998 budget provided for a special scheme of capital allowances for hotels of at least three star standard in respect of hotels which are located in counties Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and Roscommon and those parts of counties <Col N="254" /> Donegal, Mayo and Sligo which are not designated areas under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas.</P>
    <P>In view of the significant growth in tourism accommodation in recent years, there are no proposals at present to introduce any further new schemes of assistance for the provision of additional tourist accommodation.</P>

      <P>My Department currently has 12 proposals to build new pools, including one in Longford. All proposals are being examined giving consideration to such matters as the need for a swimming pool in an area; suitability of the proposed site; future viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues; construction and operating standards of existing facilities; satisfactory financial plan; and the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds.</P>
      <P>However, it should be noted that funding for new pools in 1999 and 2000 is already committed to pools in Navan, Ennis and Wicklow where work is currently under way and to a pool in Dundalk which is at an advanced stage of planning.</P>
      <P>In August, when I announced the £45 million grant-aid package for local authority swimming pools over the next three years, I indicated my willingness to consider proposals from local authorities incorporating private sector investment. I hope to issue guidelines to local authorities on this approach before the end of the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of the specific research to which the Deputy refers. However, it is recognised that many children involved in juvenile delinquency and coming to the attention of the courts are <Col N="255" /> found to have very low levels of educational attainment.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy in relation to the identification of children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia, is in line with the recommendations of the special education review committee which reported in 1993. The criteria involved include: an assessment by a psychologist on a standardised test of intelligence which places general intellectual ability within the average range or above, and performance in basic literacy skills in relation to objective criteria using standardised tests. It would generally be expected that not more than 2% of the overall pupil population would be found to be in this category.</P>
    <P>The educational needs of children with specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support where necessary of the remedial teacher service.</P>
    <P>All juvenile offenders placed in the custodial facilities operated under my Department undergo detailed assessment of all aspects of their needs, including their educational needs. The educational programmes delivered in these facilities are very broadly based and take account of the wide range of needs and abilities of the children in question. Individualised education and care programmes are developed for each child and any special educational needs are addressed as part of these programmes. The educational progress of all these children is monitored by my Department's inspectorate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's policy in relation to the identification and support of children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia, is in line with the recommendations of the special education review committee which reported in 1993. The criteria involved in the identification of such conditions include: assessment by a psychologist on a standardised test of intelligence which places general intellectual ability within the average range or above; performance in basic literacy <Col N="256" /> skills in relation to objective criteria, such as standardised tests.</P>
    <P>It would be expected that not more than some 2% of the overall pupil population would be found to be in this category. The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability, including children with dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system with the support where appropriate of the remedial teacher service.</P>
    <P>In November 1998, I announced a major new development in special education services under which all children with special educational needs in the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The response may take the form of additional teaching or child care support, or both, depending on the particular needs involved. Children with learning disabilities, including dyslexia, are entitled to avail of this development. Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in special schools or special classes dedicated to such children. These facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
    <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes and may receive additional support through a remedial teacher, guidance counsellor or subject teacher.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing the manner in which my Department operates in all areas concerning special needs, including the commissioning and use of research.</P>

      <Quest>if he will confirm that three children (details supplied) have received their portion of the widow's and orphan's pension; the results of the special commission set up in October 1998 to examine the case; the cost of making the payment; the amount due to the children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The children in question were born some years after their father retired from service as a national teacher.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the payment of children's pension is that the spouses and children's pension scheme in the case of national teachers specifically excludes from benefit children born after a teacher's retirement. A revised scheme, which will provide for benefits in the case of children born after retirement, amongst other matters, is currently being negotiated under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers but, in accordance with the terms of Partnership 2000, the negotiations cannot be concluded until the report of the Commission on public service pensions can be considered. The report is expected to be available in the early part of next year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, in anticipation of the necessary revision being made, the Department of Finance has, at the request of my Department, consented to an amendment being made to the original scheme to cater for the current case and any similar cases that might arise.</P>
      <P>The details regarding payment of the children's pension in the case in question are now being worked on. As all of the children in this case are over 16, documentation has been sought in order to confirm that two of the children are in full-time education and, in the case of one child who is over 22, to confirm the nature of her illness. Payment, including arrears due since the father's death in December 1997, will be made as soon as the necessary documentation has been received.</P>
      <P>Assuming that the three children are eligible, the annual cost of the children's pension will be £8,820.36 at current rates.</P>

      <P>At primary and second level, my Department has allocated additional teaching posts to address the difficulties associated with teaching pupils from varied ethnic backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Where the necessity for personal development is identified for teachers dealing with pupils from varied ethnic backgrounds, the Department responds to this need. In this regard, the refugee language support unit, which has been established under the management of Trinity College earlier this year with support from my Department, has begun to provide specific support for teachers who have students from varied ethnic backgrounds in their classes.</P>
      <P>On a more general basis, the civic social and political education programme also provides the opportunity for teachers to address the issue of ethnic diversity and teachers from a number of schools have received inservice in the areas of interculturalism and understanding refugees.</P>

      <P>I established a working group last year to examine the rights, roles, duties and responsibilities of principals, both administrative principals and teaching principals, in primary schools. The working group, which included representatives from the education partners, has recently completed its report and has made a number of recommendations. I am currently considering the most appropriate response to this report and have arranged to meet with representatives of the INTO to discuss the issues on 30 November next.</P>
      <P>In relation to support for the provision of secretarial and caretaking services, my Department provides funding towards the cost of such services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. Under this scheme, schools either qualified for a full-time post or were included in a sharing arrangement. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Under the PESP scheme, schools with 195 pupils or more and who do not have a service already under the schemes outlined above, receive grants of £30 per pupil, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant.</P>
      <P>I have set out hereunder the statistics in relation to the 239 schools in Galway.</P>

    <P>My officials will be writing to all qualifying schools over the next couple of months confirming their inclusion, and setting out the details of the scheme.

However, there are inputs to the course on the subject as part of a general alertness orientation programme on a variety of learning difficulties that may be present in the case of some pupils. Such lectures assist students in identifying such problems as dyslexia. The issue of dyslexia is covered in much greater depth as part of remedial education courses.</P>
