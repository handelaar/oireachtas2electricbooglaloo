      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of major public importance &ndash; the threatened loss of 125 jobs at the Oxford Health plant in Mullingar, the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to intervene to try to avert the job losses and, in the light of significant job losses in the north midlands during the past 12 months, the need for targeted measures to find work for those who have lost their jobs.</P>

      <P>I am not seeking a detailed discussion. The House will very rapidly empty, Sir, and will be becalmed for the rest of the day. In view of the unprecedented threatened strike, the fact that thousands of people are booked in for different kinds of operations and that some hospitals have decided to close entirely, does the Taoiseach not think that next week will be too late? In advance of such a debate, which will be welcomed, the general public who will not be party to that debate are entitled, over this weekend, to have some communication from the Minister for Health and Children, wherever he happens to be, as to the arrangements that have been put in place? Negotiations are taking place in secret between the health authorities and the Department of Health and Children and the general public are entitled to&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senior people on both sides are trying to work out adequate cover. It is well known in the hospitals and the health service generally what they are trying to do. There are difficulties. The Minister for Health and Children gave two lengthy interviews on two stations yesterday and explained the current position to the public.</P>

      <P>In view of the announcement made outside this House by the Minster of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, will the Taoiseach tell us when legislation to increase fines under the health and safety legislation will be introduced to ensure that safety on building sites is improved and fines which are paltry by today's standards are increased?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention against Torture) Bill, 1998, to the House today. It may seem, at first sight, somewhat strange that we, who are fortunate enough to live in a civilised country, with our Constitution and a body of laws designed to protect the fundamental human rights of our citizens, should today discuss a Bill which creates a statutory offence of torture. Our role in relation to upholding human rights is not limited to what happens in our own back yard, for it is also incumbent on us to play our part in the international effort to ensure that everybody can enjoy these fundamental rights, not least of which is protection against torture. Unfortunately, such protection is not universally enjoyed. The horrific images we see all too often on our television screens and the gruesome stories we read in our newspapers are a sad but compelling testimony to this fact.</P>
      <P>The international community has provided a framework for international protection against torture. That framework is contained in the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. This convention was drawn up to provide an international system under which a person who has committed torture could find no safe haven. The Bill, when enacted, will allow Ireland to play our part more fully in this international effort by enabling us to ratify this important UN convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, the Bill creates a specific statutory offence of torture with a penalty of up to life imprisonment, it allows a person to be tried here in relation to the commission of the new offence anywhere in the world and it prohibits the extradition or expulsion of a person from this State where there are substantial grounds for believing that if the extradition or <Col N="1384" /> expulsion were to take place, the person may be subjected to torture.</P>
    <P>I wish to expand on the background to the Bill. The United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in December 1984 and entered into force in June 1987. In September 1992 the Government authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for the signature on behalf of Ireland of the convention. Ireland signed the convention on 28 September 1992. There is widespread acceptance that Ireland's ratification of the convention is long overdue and it was in that context that, as Minister, I directed that this measure should be included as a priority in the very extensive programme of law reform I have undertaken.</P>
    <P>In order for Ireland to proceed to ratify the convention it is necessary to ensure that acts of torture as defined in the convention are offences under Irish law. The main purpose of this Bill is, therefore, the creation of a statutory offence of torture in line with that contained in the convention, thus facilitating our ratification. There is no statutory offence of torture in Ireland at present. However, the courts have held that the unspecified personal rights guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution include freedom from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment, and it should be borne in mind that in the absence of a specific statutory offence of torture, actions which amount to torture may also amount to other offences under our law such as serious assault offences.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the context of extradition, it has been held that extradition should be refused if the court is satisfied as a matter of probability that a person would, if delivered into another jurisdiction, be subjected to assault, torture or inhuman treatment. Given that these judgments have applied primarily to acts of physical torture, it is not certain that acts or omissions which could amount to mental torture would be covered equally. In all the circumstances, it is therefore desirable to create a specific offence of torture which includes acts and omissions which inflict both physical and mental suffering and to provide appropriate penalties in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill and in line with the convention torture will consist of the intentional infliction of severe pain and suffering, mental or physical, on a person for such purposes as obtaining from that person, or another person, information or a confession, punishing that person for an act which he or she, or another person, has committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or coercing him or her, or another person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind. However, it will not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions. This too is in line with article 1 of the convention.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the Bill is not limited to acts of torture which occur within the <Col N="1385" /> State. Extra territorial jurisdiction will apply to such behaviour which takes place outside the State. In this respect the Bill goes further than the minimum obligation in the convention, which is to establish jurisdiction over offences committed in our own territory or outside the State if committed by or against an Irish citizen. Given that we are dealing with behaviour which is so evidently repugnant to the whole basis of society and democracy, it is only right and proper that we should take this approach.</P>
    <P>In view of the seriousness of the offence, a person found guilty of the offence of torture would be liable to imprisonment for up to life. The Bill also contains provisions dealing with offences such as aiding and abetting or attempting or conspiring to commit acts of torture, as well as acts designed to frustrate efforts to apprehend and prosecute persons for an offence of torture. A person found guilty of such an offence would also be liable to imprisonment for life.</P>
    <P>Proceedings for an offence of torture, which may only be taken by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, may be taken in any place in the State and the Bill will enable persons charged with the new offence committed abroad to be tried anywhere in the State. The creation of the new offence of torture necessitates the amendment of a number of other Acts. Accordingly, the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, is being amended to provide that the new offence of torture will not be considered a political offence and that extradition cannot be denied on that ground. The Defence Act, 1954, is being amended in respect of the jurisdiction of courts martial to deal with the new offence of torture. The Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, is being amended in respect of the procedure in the District Court where a person is charged with torture and to provide that bail may only be granted by the High Court in such cases. To give effect to the convention, the Extradition Act, 1965, is being amended to provide that a person will not be extradited to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she may be subjected to torture. Other provisions in the Bill deal with privileges and immunities for certain bodies which are established under the convention, the commencement of the Act and expenses arising out of its administration.</P>
    <P>The convention imposes a number of further obligations on states parties which do not require to be included in legislation. For example, article 10 provides that states parties will ensure that education and information regarding the prohibition against torture are fully included in the training of police, medical personnel, public officials and others who may be involved in the custody or treatment of any person who is subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment. These are matters that can be dealt with administratively.</P>
    <P>I will deal in detail with the sections of the Bill. Section 1 contains standard provisions providing for certain necessary definitions. It defines the <Col N="1386" /> terms &ldquo;public official&rdquo; and &ldquo;torture&rdquo;. It states that a public official includes a person acting in an official capacity. The definition of torture, which follows closely that contained in the convention itself, contains a number of elements. In the first instance it includes both acts and omissions by which severe pain and suffering is intentionally inflicted on a person. The pain and suffering may be either physical or mental. The definition further provides that the pain may be inflicted for such purposes as obtaining from the person, or a third party, information or a confession, punishing the person for an act which he or she, or a third party, has committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or coercing the person or a third party or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.</P>
    <P>Torture does not include, however, any act arising solely from, inherent in, or incidental to lawful sanctions. There might be varying views as to how precisely to define the offence of torture, but primarily what is at issue here is to enable the State to ratify the UN convention and, in the circumstances, there are advantages in adhering as closely as possible to the definition which the convention contains.</P>
    <P>Section 2 sets out those categories of persons who may be guilty of torture. Under subsection (1), a person who is a public official and carries out an act of torture on a person will be guilty of the offence of torture. This subsection further provides that the nationality of the public official is immaterial, or whether the act of torture was carried out within the State or elsewhere. Subsection (2) provides that a person, other than a public official, who carries out an act of torture on a person at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official, will also be guilty of the offence of torture. It is immaterial what the nationality of the person is or whether the act of torture was carried out within the State or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The practical effect of subsections (1) and (2) is that a public official or person acting at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official, no matter what the nationality of either, who carries out an act of torture on another person, irrespective of where that act was carried out, will be guilty of torture under the Bill. Under subsection (3), a person who commits the offence of torture will be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for up to life. This will make the offence an arrestable one, and will put torture on a par with other very serious offences.</P>
    <P>Section 3 creates a number of offences other than the carrying out of acts of torture, but which contribute in some way to the offence of torture or are designed to frustrate efforts to prosecute others for the offence. Thus, any person, irrespective of nationality, will be guilty of an offence if he or she does any of the following &ndash; directs, instructs, aids, abets, counsels or procures, within the State or elsewhere, the commission of the offence of torture, attempts or conspires to com<Col N="1387" /> mit the offence of torture or tries to obstruct or prevent the arrest or prosecution of a person for the offence of torture.</P>
    <P>As in section 2(3), a person who is found guilty of any of these offences will be liable to imprisonment for up to life. Given the particularly heinous nature of what can be at issue, it is appropriate that those who assist in the commission of an offence should also be subject to the same maximum penalty. However, my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, is currently examining section 3 to ascertain whether some or all the offences in section 3 might be already covered by section 7 of the Criminal Law Act, 1997. Section 7 of that Act deals generally with aiding and abetting and so forth, and among the issues being addressed is whether the 1997 Act would cover such ancillary offences when committed outside the State. Arising from the outcome of these deliberations, I might bring forward suitable amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Article 3.1 of the convention provides that no party shall expel, return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture. This concept is also known as <i>non-refoulement</i>. Section 4, which was drafted on the basis of the wording of the Refugee Act and article 3 of the convention, covers in Irish law the grounds contained in article 3 of the convention, with the exception of extradition which is covered in section 7.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) provides that proceedings for an offence under the Bill can be taken anywhere in the State and may be treated as if the offence had been committed in that place. The effect of this will be that persons charged with the offence of torture or a related offence which has been committed either in the State or abroad may be tried anywhere in the State. Under subsection (2) of this section, a prosecution for an offence under this Bill may only be taken by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is included to avoid multiple provisions in legislation relating to extraterritorial jurisdiction. Under section 38 of the Extradition Act, 1965, an offence committed abroad by an Irish citizen is, in certain circumstances, an offence under Irish law. The effect of subsection (3) is that where an Irish national is accused of the offence of torture committed abroad, any proceedings will be taken under the Bill and not under section 38 of the Extradition Act. By virtue of subsection (4), a person charged with an offence under this Bill will be tried in the Central Criminal Court, where the most serious offences known to the law are usually tried.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the amendment of sections 169 and 192 of the Defence Act, 1954. Section 169 of the Defence Act, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, deals with the trial of certain non-military offences by court martial. Section 169(3) provides that where a person <Col N="1388" /> charged under the section is convicted by court martial of certain offences, for example, manslaughter, rape or genocide, that person will be punished accordingly. Paragraph (a) of section 6 amends section 169(3) by adding that where a person is convicted by court martial of an offence under this Bill, the person will be liable to a penalty of up to life imprisonment in the same way as a person is liable to that penalty if convicted in a non-military court.</P>
    <P>Section 192 of the Defence Act deals with the jurisdiction of courts martial. Subsection (2) provides that a limited court martial will not have jurisdiction to try certain offences, for example, treason and murder, and subsection (3) provides that a court martial shall not have jurisdiction to try any person subject to military law for certain offences, for example, treason, murder, manslaughter, rape and genocide, unless the offence was committed while the person was on active service. Under paragraph (b) of section 6, the offences created by the Bill will also be excluded from the jurisdiction of courts martial in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 7 involves a number of amendments to the Extradition Act, 1965. These arise on account of the requirement in Article 3.1 of the convention that no state shall expel, return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Accordingly, section 7 of this Bill will add a further condition to the relevant sections of the 1965 Act to allow for refusal of a request for extradition where there are substantial grounds for believing that a person may be subjected to torture. Paragraph (a) will include a definition of torture in section 3 of the 1965 Act which will have the same meaning as it has in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11(2) of the 1965 Act includes provision that a person shall not be extradited if there are substantial grounds for believing that, if extradited, the person's position may be prejudiced on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion. Paragraph (b) will insert an additional subsection (2A) the effect of which will be that a person shall not be extradited if there are substantial grounds for believing that the person may be subjected to torture.</P>
    <P>Section 33(3) of the 1965 Act provides that the Minister shall not make an order that a person is to be surrendered if he or she is of the opinion that it would involve transit through any territory where there is reason to believe that the person's life or freedom may be threatened by reason of the person's race, religion, nationality or political opinion. Under paragraph (c) this will be amended to state that the Minister may also refuse to make an order if there is reason to believe that the person may be subjected to torture.</P>
    <P>Section 44(2) of the 1965 Act, as amended by section 8 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, includes provision that a warrant issued in a place to which Part III of that Act applies shall not be <Col N="1389" /> endorsed for execution in the State if there are substantial grounds for believing that the person's position would be prejudiced on account of the person's race, religion, nationality or political opinion. This is amended by paragraph (d) of section 7 to include the belief that the person may be subjected to torture.</P>
    <P>Section 50(2)(bb) of the 1965 Act, inserted by section 9 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, includes provision that a person arrested under Part III of the Act shall be released if there are substantial grounds for believing that the person's position would be prejudiced on account of race, religion, nationality or political opinion. This paragraph is amended, by paragraph (e) of section 7, to include the belief that the person may be subjected to torture as a further ground for release.</P>
    <P>Section 8 amends the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, in two respects. Paragraph (a) of section 8 inserts reference to offences created by the Bill into section 13(1) of the 1967 Act, the effect of which is that the District Court will not have jurisdiction either to deal summarily with offences created by the Bill or to send the accused forward for sentence in relation to those offences. At present, section 13(1) excludes this jurisdiction in the case of offences such as treason, murder or genocide to which will now be added the torture offences created by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, deals with bail in the case of treason, murder, genocide and certain other offences. It provides that bail may only be granted by the High Court in those cases. Paragraph (b) of section 8 inserts a new paragraph into section 29(1) of the 1967 Act to add the new offence of torture to those offences listed. As a result, bail may only be granted by the High Court in the case of a person charged with an offence under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 amends the First Schedule to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, in order to include the offences created by the Bill. The effect of this will be that these offences will not be considered to be political offences and that extradition cannot be denied, therefore, on that ground.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends the Schedule to the Bail Act, 1997, in order to include the offences created by the Bill. The effect of their inclusion will be that the new bail regime, as provided for in the Bail Act, 1997, will apply to offences under this Bill. Under that Act, bail may be refused to a person charged with a serious offence where it is considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence. Serious offences are defined by reference to a Schedule in the Act. It is considered appropriate that the offences created by the present Bill should be regarded as serious offences for bail purposes and this section provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Article 17 of the UN convention establishes a committee against torture to carry out the function of ensuring that states abide by their obli<Col N="1390" /> gations under the convention. Article 21 permits the setting up of an <i>ad hoc </i>conciliation commission in appropriate cases. Article 23 states that members of the committee and of the <i>ad hoc</i> conciliation commission shall be entitled to the facilities, privileges and immunities of experts on mission for the United Nations as laid down in the relevant sections of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations, which is incorporated in the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>Section 11 makes provision in the Bill for the Committee against Torture, and any <i>ad hoc</i> conciliation commission established by the committee, to be accorded the appropriate privileges and immunities as are necessary for them to exercise their functions independently.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is a standard provision, which provides that any expenses incurred by any Minister of the Government in the administration of the Act will, to the extent sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of money provided by the Oireachtas. The Bill may give rise to additional costs, for example, the costs incurred in prosecuting persons accused of offences under the Bill. In addition, the convention imposes obligations on states which have ratified it regarding expenses of the committee established under article 17 as well as expenses incurred in connection with meetings of states and the committee. However, there are no grounds for believing at present that any substantial expenditure will arise. Section 13 is a standard provision setting out the short title of the Bill and providing for the commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this Bill honours an important international obligation. Furthermore, it is a positive indication of the repugnance we feel at unspeakable acts committed most frequently by tyrannical regimes which are sadly still all too prevalent in the world today. It is also a demonstration of our willingness to do all we can to ensure that the perpetrators of those heinous crimes are brought to justice. As recently as last December, we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I am pleased that because of the priority which I accorded the measure, it proved possible to publish the Bill prior to that anniversary.</P>
    <P>As always, I will follow the debate with great care and interest and will take full account of the contributions. I thank the Deputies for their co-operation.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>I welcome the long overdue arrival before the Dáil of the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill, 1998. It is 15 years since the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Ireland signed the convention in 1992. Finally, seven years later, we are about to give legislative effect to the convention. <Col N="1391" /> While I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill forward, it is nevertheless over seven months since the Bill was introduced in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to appreciate the reason for tardiness time and time again in introducing follow-up legislation in respect of the various conventions to which we sign up. Indeed there are quite a lot of conventions to which we have appended our signature and have still not had them ratified by Parliament. This was particularly evident during the course of the debate on the Immigration Bill, 1999, when Deputy Howlin and I sought to strengthen the protection for asylum seekers by inserting amendments to enshrine protections provided by international conventions and agreements to which Ireland is a party, but the provisions of which were never introduced into domestic law. Our amendments were not accepted by the Minister or the Government because of the fact that, while we are a party to the various conventions and we accept the spirit and the principles they contain, we have not put the necessary domestic legislation in force in the Dáil or Seanad to give them legal effect. This was pointed out forcibly to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights by the various organisations which made submissions to the committee on the proposed Human Rights Commission Bill which is part of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties rightly made the point to the joint committee that there are no international human rights instruments which have been given the force of law in the State. Excluded from domestic law, for example, is the International Bill of Rights, namely, the Universal Declaration, the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on Economic and Social Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Declaration of the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, 1993, the various protocols to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom and the European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock. These are but a small sample cross section of the various human rights treaties to which Ireland is party but, while applicable in Ireland, they are not part of Irish domestic law. I think we need to emphasise and underline the fact that when we enter international covenants, we should follow up as quickly as possible with the necessary effecting domestic legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure before the House today is welcome in that it defines for the first time in our law what constitutes torture. It sets torture in its legal context and puts in place the appropriate measures to deal with those who directly perpetrate, assist, aid or abet torture. The inclusion of mental as well as physical torture is particularly welcome. The exclusion of torture as a political <Col N="1392" /> offence for the purposes of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, is also good. The training of front line personnel to deal with torture is a necessary and positive move.</P>
    <P>It is sad, however, that as we leave the 20th century and enter the new millennium, the epilogue of the final few years of the old millennium should be littered with human rights atrocities as barbaric as those committed at any time in the past. One must ask whether, in spite of all the scientific and technological advances, humanity has advanced one iota. One must query why it is that in the dying years of the century we have seen political power struggle after political power struggle displaying a total contempt for human life as mass extermination is indulged in under the newly coined expression of &ldquo;ethnic cleansing&rdquo;. In many instances, this has occurred in areas which have faced it before, where a qualified peace or, at least, an imposed stability was in place for several decades, but when there was a political transition or transfer of power and a spark ignited, there was a reversion to a savagery one had assumed and hoped was a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>One must ask also how effective is the raft of international arrangements and conventions which have come on stream, almost on an annual basis, with a view to protecting human rights and fundamental freedom. Why is it that in spite of the dire warnings of the international community and all the protocols and conventions in relation to what will be done to the perpetrators of such atrocities when brought before the international criminal courts, and in spite of all the sabre-rattling in the direction of those who have carried out these atrocities, these conventions, protocols, warnings and legislation are disregarded time and time again?</P>
    <P>There is a marked lack of consistency and commitment on the part of the big players on the world political stage. It is quite obvious that strategic self-interests of the super powers are of paramount importance. Self-interest is invariably a factor in the degree of interest they show or in their willingness to act as world political policemen. Elements such as geographical location, natural resources and trade issues are all factors in the degree of urgency and importance shown by the militarily strong members of the international community. The sad net result is that the credibility of the United Nations has been at stake for a considerable period. While the most unspeakable atrocities were committed in Algeria in the last two years, where little babies were thrown into cauldrons of boiling water, all the international community could do was watch and wring its hands in helpless anguish.</P>
    <P>In the case of Rwanda, the world community stands indicted for abdicating totally its responsibility. In Rwanda we witnessed an attempt by the United Nations Security Council to create a democracy. Everyone warned there would be trouble and everyone could see it on the horizon. An armed militia was on the loose and a so-called <Col N="1393" /> powerful government army claimed to be powerless against the violence of the pro-democracy supporters. In the end the attempt to create a democracy led to the genocide of over one million people.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said recently: &ldquo;I am haunted by what we did not do in Rwanda&rdquo;. Yet, the Rwandan situation was replicated in the last few weeks in the case of East Timor. The United Nations organised and oversaw elections to enable the people of East Timor to express their political will through the ballot box. There was a massive expression of the popular will reminiscent of South Africa or, indeed, Cambodia where I was an election observer last year. Some 78.5 per cent of the people of East Timor voted for independence and instead of honouring its pledge to the people of East Timor they were totally abandoned. Even the United Nations personnel themselves were abandoned to their fate by their very own mother organisation and were left helplessly and hopelessly trying to shelter the frightened people from the marauding and rampaging militia. These were a people to whom the United Nations had given such categorical assurances that they would underpin whatever arrangement the people democratically voted for. There was no United Nations follow-up plan in place, even though it was patently obvious that the inevitable result would lead to a pro-Indonesian military backlash.</P>
    <P>Thousands of people were trucked away to unknown destinations. Their only crime was that they refused to be intimidated by the warning massacres into voting for staying with Indonesia. It was quite obvious that the intention of these massacres was to fire a shot across the bow of people to frighten them. Yet, they went out and expressed wholeheartedly and almost universally across the board, their support for the break with Indonesia. The Indonesian police and army gave the militia guns and a free hand while Jakarta spoke innocently about the trouble being caused by &ldquo;unruly elements&rdquo;. At least 10,000 innocent people have been slaughtered. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are, as we speak, huddled in the mountains of East Timor, or in West Timor, and have been left without food, sustenance, water or shelter.</P>
    <P>The world is appalled as it watches yet another brutal coup being enacted. East Timor is yet another disaster for the international community and particularly for the United Nations. Having obtained total UN assurances and with the agreement of the Indonesian and Portuguese Governments, the people of East Timor were asked to come out and vote for autonomy and a better future. They were asked to put their faith and trust in the United Nations and the international community to oversee and be the custodians of whatever the people voted for. That did not happen, however, so is it any wonder that the people of East Timor should feel betrayed?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> Unfortunately, the lessons of the past have not been learned. For United Nations operations to be successful they need to be properly planned. They must have clear mandates and trained peacekeepers on the ground and in place in advance. There must also be assured financing, an effective and integrated United Nations command with the full, undivided and unequivocal support of a united and purposeful UN Security Council. None of these requirements was in place either in Rwanda or East Timor.</P>
    <P>To have encouraged the creation of a democracy in East Timor, as in Rwanda, and to have sponsored an independence referendum in East Timor, only then to abandon people who were promised so much, is a stain on the reputation of the United Nations that will never be erased. One must give credit to the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, whose quiet diplomacy eventually succeeded in getting President Habibie and the Indonesian Government to agree to the arrival of an international force. However, for the thousands of people killed &ndash; over 10,000 of them &ndash; it is all much too late. One must ask whether, together with Milosevic, the perpetrators of such brutality will ever end up before the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.</P>
    <P>While the focus of world attention during spring and early summer was very much on the Balkans and latterly on East Timor, news again seeped out of human rights violations and some of the worst crimes ever committed against humanity in the West African state of Sierra Leone. The New York based Human Rights Watch reported that, while the rest of the world concentrated on Kosovo and East Timor, acts of cruelty as savage as anything seen in Kosovo or elsewhere were being inflicted on the innocent people of Sierra Leone. The ten year old civil war there has seen the displacement of one million citizens and the slaughter of over 50,000 people. The Human Rights Watch group gave graphic accounts of systemic murder, mutilation and rape by the rebel forces who stormed the capital Freetown. The 60 page report documents how entire families were gunned down in the street, children had their hands, arms and legs hacked off, girls were taken away by the rebels to be sexually abused, raped and in some cases gang raped and special units carried out executions of children, in some cases as young as eight years. The general view is that the attacks, or their severity, were not spontaneous but were well planned and systematic. There were frenzies of mutilation for several days, followed by a lull and then another frenzy, indicating the existence of a command structure.</P>
    <P>The report also claims that while the rebels carried out much of the slaughter, they were not alone in their savagery. Members of the West African peace-keeping force, ECOMOG, and to a lesser extent the civil defence forces and the Sierra Leone police also carried out atrocities and reprisals, mainly against those believed to be rebels or rebel sympathisers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> While we are often wont to outline the happenings in places as far away as Chad, Kenya, Chile, East Timor and Kosovo, we tend to overlook or fully appreciate the torture and brutality that has gone on in the recent past, and is still going on, in our own country. One recalls the barbaric and degrading treatment meted out to republicans and the republican community by the state authorities in Northern Ireland in the aftermath of internment and, indeed, to those arrested in the post-internment period. In spite of the cease-fire and the peace process, punishment beatings and knee-cappings are still carried out on a weekly basis, yet those responsible have not been brought to book.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's sanctions and other tough measures. Hopefully, it will send out a strong message and have a deterrent effect. However, while one is not optimistic, one must nevertheless continue to hope and to persist. Ireland has a special role and must lead the way in putting human rights at the very top of the international agenda.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned section 10 of the Bill, relating to bail provisions, but when will these provisions actually come into effect? Clover Hill is now open with 400 places on stream. We have additional prison spaces, as well as the women's prison, at Mountjoy. The provisions to restrict bail in certain circumstances, which people overwhelmingly voted for, were passed by the House in 1997. They are part and parcel of section 10, but when will they come into effect?</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe's committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment made its second periodic visit to Ireland in September 1998 and its report was sent to the Government on 8 April this year. The expectation is that it will be published along with the official response within six months. Coincidentally, that deadline expires today. When replying to the debate will the Minister tell the House whether the Government has prepared its response and, if so, when can we expect to see the publication of what is an important document? By virtue of the fact that there is a deadline and also in the context of the Bill, it would be useful if we could know what progress has been made in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill, 1998, in the final months of the 20th century. It is a century in which torture and the denial of human rights have been shameful characteristics. However difficult and daunting the task appears, and is, we must try to establish within the world community international norms of civilised behaviour. That is the fundamental goal of the United Nations and the convention which spawned this important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democracy is largely a creature of this century. It is both imperfect and fragile. For much of mankind, the norm is a form of governance that is <Col N="1396" /> oppressive and cruel. In recent years we have revisited, through the media and in reality, concepts and entities we thought had disappeared. We have revisited concentration camps in the former Yugoslavia, we have seen rape used as an instrument of war and terror and that innocuous sounding phrase &ldquo;ethnic cleansing&rdquo; has been revealed in all its dreadful and awful horror. It has already been stated that for all our technological advances, when we reflect on the state of mankind at the end of this millennium we wonder how much progress we have made in civilising ourselves. The awful reality facing us, particularly in Europe, is that the potential is there in any ethnic or national group to commit the most heinous, barbaric crimes.</P>
    <P>Ireland, no less than any other civilised nation, must play its full part in trying desperately to shape a better world and form an acceptable world order. At a time when we can be depressed or even disheartened by the degree of totalitarianism that is evident when we look across the globe, we must realise that change can only come about through concerted international effort. In a way we have reached a crossroads in world history. The dominant political order since the close of the Second World War, namely, the Cold War between the forces of western capitalism and Soviet dominated communism, has come to an end. The dreadful atrocities that were committed to sustain that conflict may no longer be evident but it has not left in its wake a more enlightened or civilised society.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House will enable Ireland to ratify the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The statutory offence of torture is created in the Bill in accordance with the definition contained in the UN convention. It has already been stated that this Bill has been a long time coming. Ireland was specifically mentioned for its inaction in ratifying a convention that was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1984 and which entered into force in June 1987. Therefore, a long period has passed since the entering into force of the convention and its ratification by Ireland in the form of the Bill we are now debating. As a former member of Government, I share some of the blame for the unacceptable delay in ratifying treaties that are critically important to the struggle to form the moral international order I have described.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the Upper House, the Minister stated further obligations were imposed on Ireland by the convention that were outside the statutory requirements encompassed in the legislation. Article 10 requires states to include education and training in respect of the convention to police officers, medical personnel, public officials and others. I am interested to hear about, and perhaps in his reply the Minister might make specific mention of, the proposals that will be put in place in this regard. What training and focus will be given to the Garda authorities, medical <Col N="1397" /> personnel and others regarding the contents of the legislation and those of the UN convention? I say this in the context of an Ireland which is changing culturally and ethnically. However, I am heartened and glad there is no suggestion that the offences encompassed in the legislation would ever be committed by agents of this State. It is important that specific education and understanding of the fears, background, history and customs are part of the training programme available to all agents of this State. I say this in the broadest possible context.</P>
    <P>People are arriving into this country all the time and we now have a variety of ethnic and cultural minorities. Some of them are fearful, some come from a background where there is endemic fear of authority and where the forces of law and order are actually forces of repression. We must understand that culture and adopt and amend our policing and civic authorities to ensure that people can live, recreate and interface with the civic society in this country without fear or intimidation. That is a large and serious job because this issue goes beyond cultural and ethnic minorities and embraces other minorities such as those with a different sexual orientation. I hope the new training skills to which I refer are being provided and I would welcome the comments of the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>An important and critical part of the Bill is the extra-territorial nature of the offences encompassed within it. What must be clearly established in Irish law and public policy is that no individual of any nationality can shelter in this jurisdiction from the consequences of acts of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment carried out anywhere in the world. The Bill defines the offence of torture, not an easy concept to define. The definition closely follows that outlined in the convention. I am slightly concerned, however, about the opt-out clause included in the Bill, namely, the so-called lawful sanctions opt-out. This clause is contained in the UN convention but there is a requirement that the definition should be without prejudice to any instrument or law of wider application. This clear modification of the opt-out provision should be included in the Bill and I will propose an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage to that end.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides a clear definition of torture. It states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;torture&rdquo; means an act or omission by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)for such purposes as&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)obtaining from that person, or from another person, information or a confession,</P>
    <P>(ii)punishing that person for an act which the person concerned or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> (iii)intimidating or coercing that person or a third person,</P>
    <P>or</P>
    <P>(b)for any reason that is based on any form of discrimination,</P>
    <P>It further states:</P>
    <P>but does not include any such act that arises solely from, or is inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about that and perhaps the Minister, when replying, would allay my fears and obviate the need to amend that section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about another aspect of the Bill, as drafted. The Bill applies to acts of torture and has international application. However, it applies only to acts of torture by or involving the State. The issue of torture perpetrated by an individual on another individual or on another group should be addressed also. It is my understanding that the UN convention allows, under article 1.2, national laws to offer a wider definition than that encompassed in the convention. We should have a broader definition in this legislation and take that base of the convention to be our ceiling because it would be a more acceptable proposal to encompass acts of torture perpetrated by individuals on individuals as well.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments to existing legislation are envisaged in the Bill. I welcome the amendment to the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, to ensure torture could not be considered a political offence to prevent extradition. A torturer seeking refuge in this country could not use our extradition laws which seek to ensure that people are not extradited for political offences as a shield to prevent that individual facing due process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, envisaged in the Bill where bail would only be granted by the High Court, although I echo the concerns expressed by Deputy Jim Higgins about the actual date of enactment of the changes in the bail laws supported by the people in a referendum some time ago. My party has tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for answer next week to seek a fuller explanation of his timeframe on that. I also welcome the amendment to the Extradition Act, 1965, legislating for the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i> where extradition would be prohibited to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that a person so extradited might be subjected to torture or degrading or inhuman treatment. Those measures, and the Bill as a whole, are welcome and my party will support them at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill forms part of a comprehensive policy platform. We are aware of the ongoing proceedings in the United Kingdom where General Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, is finally being called to account. Notwithstanding the hysterical rantings of a former British Prime <Col N="1399" /> Minister, most decent and civilised people would regard that as just and proper. In those proceedings, British law prohibited the extradition of any person for crimes committed prior to the enactment of the United Kingdom's torture Act. In other words, the only crimes or allegations that could be considered under the process of extradition were those committed subsequent to the enactment of the torture legislation in the United Kingdom. The most serious allegations levelled against the dictator Pinochet, that in the immediate aftermath of the coup thousands of people were murdered, could not be taken into account because chronologically they occurred prior to the enactment of the UK legislation.</P>
    <P>My concern is that a Pinochet figure could escape extradition for offences committed before the passing of this particular measure. I would welcome the views of the Minister in this regard. I would have a major concern if it were possible for an individual to come to Ireland, having committed awful crimes in Bosnia or elsewhere, and not face extradition because they were committed prior to this legislation being put on the Statute Book. I hope the Minister will assure me that such an unacceptable vista can be avoided.</P>
    <P>Much is made of Ireland's position in the arena of human rights. I readily acknowledge the work done on Ireland's behalf by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews. He has done Trojan work in the human rights sphere and in putting Ireland's position as a champion of human rights into focus. We all share a degree of pride in that. Too often, however, we take a strong position on issues or countries in respect of which we have no strategic interest or economic vulnerability. We could do more and this debate should spur us on to do more, even where it will do us harm economically. Larger countries often take an economic or business decision rather than a moral decision in the case of pushing for sanctions or taking action against totalitarian regimes or against instances of major injustice.</P>
    <P>The man likely to be East Timor's first democratically elected president, Mr. Xanana Gusmao, was in Ireland this week. His presence here highlights the unanswerable need to hold to account those guilty of heinous offences during the Indonesian occupation of his country. The High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, has already called for accountability and this is one issue on which Ireland has taken a strong moral line and which we should vigorously pursue. We must support the calls for the establishment of a crimes commission to ensure that those who engaged in dreadful acts of murder and barbarity are called to account. Unless it is accepted internationally that those who commit crimes against humanity will be pursued and prosecuted, such offences will continue to be perpetrated.</P>
    <P>This practice is widespread around the globe today. From Africa to South America and from Asia to Europe, instances of brutal crimes are all <Col N="1400" /> too common. Some instances have been outlined already by Deputy Jim Higgins. Besides having a very depressing read, one could certainly occupy this House for many hours, if not days, listing the scale of the problems of genocide, torture, inhumanity, brutality and barbarity. However, we on this island cannot be complacent. We cannot believe all that nastiness and awfulness exists somewhere else and that we are somehow immune from it. We have witnessed terrorist actions of the most dreadful kind and we have witnessed State reactions which trampled on human rights and the rule of law. This is a cause for deep concern.</P>
    <P>There is another issue that causes me grave concern and which should be at the top of the Minister's agenda. In our own communities we are witnessing the unacceptable phenomena of punishment beatings, threats and community expulsions. In some of our most vulnerable and marginalised communities we have seen self-styled local policing operating on the basis of terrorising their own communities. We must be vigilant and we have to confront that sort of lawlessness.</P>
    <P>A colleague of mine gave me an instance of a meeting he was summoned to by a local community group in this city. He arrived at a large community centre where there were several Deputies, including a Minister of State. What transpired was little short of a kangaroo court, where an individual accused of criminal activity was paraded before for judgment of the people &ndash; of the mob. This is a direct challenge to our democracy and to the rule of law. If we do not deal with issues like this, instances of torture, as defined in this Bill and in the United Nations convention, will become a feature of this nation as it has become a feature of countries across the globe. We pride ourselves on having a settled democracy, but in my constituency in the past few days arms caches have been discovered which contained three pounds of Semtex and offensive weapons, including a missile launcher. I congratulate the Garda Síochána on the detection work involved in those discoveries, but these issues cause the deepest concern. I am concerned that within all our communities, no matter how settled, civilised or democratic we feel we are, there are forces that would upset the rule of law and our democratic tradition. It is incumbent on all of us not only to be aware of it but to take direct action against them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of this legislation. As I have said, it has been a long time coming. I know it will have a speedy passage through the House and I look forward to the comments of the Minister at the conclusion of Second Stage on the concerns I have raised. I hope this debate will be an impetus to us to seek an international moral world order in which Ireland can play a prominent part and which will improve the lot of all humankind into the new millennium.</P>

      <P>I too welcome the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill. As other speakers have said, it is overdue. We signed the convention in 1992 and seven years is a long time to wait for a measure as important as this. Members have mentioned other conventions we signed that require legislation which we have not got around to. I am not blaming the Minister as that comes with the job and one could not accuse this Minister of not pushing legislation through. His record shows the long list of Bills he has pushed through the House and there are others on the way. He could probably be accused of torturing his officials for the way he has pushed legislation through. However, the point that there are a number of things it would be simple to push through is a good one. If we did so we would be doing a good day's work for ourselves and for people's perception of us internationally.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, many people may ask why a country like Ireland needs a Bill like this. The very idea of torture seems alien to us, but it is the way of the world. Torture is far too common. More and more we live in the global village and we must send out the message that if people engage in these barbaric acts, they can run but they cannot hide. They will be caught and prosecuted.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies mentioned that people may think torture is a stranger to this country, but in Northern Ireland it is not strange. Increasingly, as Deputy Howlin said, it is not strange in certain communities in this State, where the gardaí and the rule of law are undermined in the public meetings he mentioned. In areas where there are problems with drugs or socially unacceptable behaviour, groups of people have decided to take the law into their own hands and often these people cause distress in communities as they do not have to go through any procedures. They threaten people, punishment beatings take place or people are told to get out of the community and not to come back. I hope this does not happen here or in the North of Ireland, but unfortunately there is an element which would like to see this happen. If they can operate like that in these communities they take control and democratically elected politicians, the gardaí and the rule of law are undermined. We should keep a very close eye on this to ensure it does not spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Torture is a global problem. One of the most important recent examples is the case taken against General Pinochet, which I do not think any Member of the House regrets. He led a military coup against a democratically elected Government which had been re-elected to a second term in office, short as the first term was. There were <Col N="1402" /> problems in Chile at the time, but when he took power, within the first year to 18 months, as Deputy Howlin said, he committed the most appalling crimes. The army there killed and tortured thousands of people. If one talks to people who were there at the time, such as members of churches and trade unionists, the systematic torture that took place was absolutely appalling. Everyone except Baroness Thatcher was delighted at the action taken. I cannot understand how an intelligent woman can argue against this man being charged with crimes he committed against his people over a long period; it seems extraordinary. Deputy Howlin pointed out that he cannot be charged for crimes committed prior to the Act being implemented in England, and perhaps the Minister could outline how our law stands on that point. Could we charge people who committed crimes prior to the implementation of this Bill? People from Kosovo and Yugoslavia may try to come to this country or others in western Europe.</P>
    <P>The other topical issue is East Timor and the Amnesty International report on Indonesia and East Timor contains some interesting information. In the Santa Cruz massacre of 1992, 270 people were killed and, in some cases, before their deaths they were tortured by various methods, including beatings on the head, shins and torso with fists, lengths of wood, iron bars, bottles, rocks and electrical cables, being burnt with lighted cigarettes, electrocution, slashing with razor blades and knives, death threats, mock executions, deliberate wounding with firearms, immersion for long periods in water, suspension upside down by the ankles, isolation, sleep and food deprivation, mutilation, sexual assault and rape. This was horrific. The military set up an honorary council to investigate these charges; ten officers were removed from their posts and moved elsewhere and only one man was charged with assault. This is incredible to us, living in a civilised country. Whereas Pinochet has been caught, what can the UN do about crimes such as this? This is only one of many examples in this report of people being tortured and killed, and it makes appalling reading.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Bill is the important thing and, as previous speakers said, the UN record is that it promises certain measures but it does not follow through, which is sad. We in the international community should look at this. I welcome the Bill and ask the Minister to respond to my point about Pinochet. I congratulate him for bringing the Bill to the House and I wish it a speedy and successful passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Ryan, for sharing his time and I welcome the publication and introduction of this Bill. While it has been a long time coming, as speakers have said, it is here at long last and the delay was no fault of the Minister. The UN agreed the convention in 1984, it was adopted as a policy in 1987 and we are now debating the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> Over the last few years, particularly in Europe, we have seen horrific and heinous crimes perpetrated against massive numbers of people. As a young parliamentarian I was concerned about the inactivity of Europe and its inability to decide how to deal with problems on our doorsteps. In Bosnia and Croatia the EU was unable to make a single policy decision on dealing with these appalling atrocities. It is only now that we are discovering some of what happened in those dark days. We must examine this issue urgently because, no matter what legislation we pass and what action is taken by countries with huge resources like the US, the EU must have a proper foreign policy so that it can issue a statement and indicate clearly what it wants the UN to do and what action it will take. Thus far we have been unable to do that and we must address this seriously.</P>
    <P>While the EU is a single financial bloc in many ways, some countries within it have a foreign policy which is driven by financial interests. We must acknowledge and deal with this quickly. No one thought the events in Bosnia could happen again, people thought it was the final barbaric act of the 20th century as we move into the third millennium, but we now find the same people persecuting the Kosovans. We have difficulties on our doorstep but are singularly unable to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Many people slate American imperialistic thinking. I would question some aspects of American foreign policy, particularly in South America, but in Europe the US has had to lead the way in resolving problems. People may ask whether there was a financial factor or why the Americans became involved. I believe the US is a democratic state and in general it tries to uphold what is sees as a democratic society, with freedom of expression, capitalism, etc. Some people in this House and this country are quick to jump on the anti-American bandwagon but that nation has often had to take the lead in resolving problems in Europe which we were singularly unable to deal with.</P>
    <P>On the Bill, Deputy Ryan outlined incidents of torture. Perhaps the Minister could respond to my concern that, as Argentina was a haven for the Nazis, so Ireland could become a haven for people who committed crimes in Bosnia, Croatia and elsewhere, should we find that this Bill does not apply retrospectively to the passing of the UN convention in 1984.</P>
    <P>It is positive legislation but the difficulty is that resources are often not made available. For example, the UN promised an independence plebiscite to the people of East Timor. The people answered that call and voted in vast numbers, but they were tortured, driven from their homes, watched their houses being destroyed, and were forced into the mountains while the UN failed to act. People in non-governmental organisations forewarned about huge problems in this area if the UN did not have a military presence <Col N="1404" /> to ensure the elections took place in a fair and free manner, without hindrance, and maintained that presence afterwards in case the Indonesian militias did not accept a result in favour of independence. Everyone on the ground thought this would happen, yet after promising the independence plebiscite and providing some personnel, the UN failed to provide military protection to ensure that those who exercised their democratic right would not be forced from their homes and their country or would not be tortured and killed. Documentary evidence of genocide is still being uncovered.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about ensuring this legislation is implemented and sending a strong message to those who commit war crimes and atrocities we must do so in an aggressive manner so that they will be brought to justice. There is not much point in saying Slobodan Milosevic perpetrated crimes against humanity, forgetting it in a few years and allowing him return to civilised society. Those who commit war crimes must be made accountable. The only way to do this is to ensure no safe havens are available to them.</P>
    <P>I have serious reservations about financial sanctions. Financial sanctions were imposed on Iraq yet I am confident that none of Saddam Hussein's revolutionary guard ever lacked food or antibiotics. Millions of Iraqis are suffering because of severe sanctions. The regime will never suffer because if it oppresses its people it does not mind if they go hungry. We need to examine how we try to undermine regimes perpetrating torture. Is it beneficial to enforce sanctions? Perhaps it would be more enlightened to use the media to expose such regimes and to encourage people by pointing out what is happening in the free world. Financial sanctions are a form of torture. They have not worked in most cases and lead to greater suffering.</P>
    <P>In this country we are no strangers to punishment beatings and torture. For a number of years so-called punishment beatings have been carried out by republican and loyalist paramilitaries in the six counties. These actions are beginning to creep into large cities here. Deputy Howlin who spoke about his constituency and there have been incidents in Cork city where a group of people claiming to be community activists marched on people's houses and intimidated them. Although some of those people have been or will be prosecuted for dealing drugs etc., such actions are still a challenge to the State and the law. This must be looked at. The State has neglected large urban housing estates. We are now acknowledging this and trying to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The most important message is that the law is there to be enforced by the Garda or the State, not by individuals who use baseball bats to punish those dealing drugs. This is unacceptable and is a serious matter. It must be dealt with in a forthright manner. While I deviate from the thrust of the Bill, this is an issue of torture. Individuals are setting themselves up as self-styled community policing groups and acting outside the law by <Col N="1405" /> punishing and torturing people. I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this legislation. I hope it has a speedy passage and that its provisions will ensure Ireland is seen by the international community as a place where human rights are upheld for everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. This issue is being focused on because of recent developments in East Timor which has been oppressed by Indonesia for many years. I concur with the speaker who complimented the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, on his initiative as regards East Timor. I also compliment Mr. Hyland who has awakened the interest of most politicians in the problems there. I hope East Timor will progress from its elections. Its people has experienced great trauma. It is interesting that the worldwide focus on Indonesia which is a powerful country probably precipitated its decision to withdraw from East Timor and allow a democracy to be established.</P>
      <P>This Bill amends the Extradition Act, 1965, which prevents the extradition of anyone who may face torture on returning to his or her country. This is important as due to the strength of our economy and our respected international record on human rights many people who could be tortured in their countries have come here to obtain citizenship. If there is a fear that someone will be tortured on returning to his or her country, his or her request for asylum should be treated favourably. There is a significant number of refugees here from countries such as Somalia and Nigeria and this concern should be uppermost in our minds. I would like to think that given our proud record we would respect their rights and privileges and if they or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform feel there is a possibility they may be tortured when they return home they should not be allowed return to their countries. It would be hypocritical in the extreme for us to pass this laudable Bill and allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is desirable. However, it is interesting to note that, as has been said, up to one third of the countries in the United Nations have records of torture. I wonder when people sit on such an august body and speak on behalf of their countries while allowing torture to take place whether there is an element of hypocrisy in introducing legislation such as this which implements a United Nations convention against torture. It is important that there is recognition of this by the United Nations. It is recognised that torture takes place in over 114 countries &ndash; a massive number. One could probably investigate a great number of countries throughout the world and discover torture taking place, for example, in <Col N="1406" /> Latin American countries and Brazil, one of the most powerful countries in the world and the eighth largest nation with a population of about 700 million. Ireland has good trade links with Brazil and a prominent Irish company recently opened a factory there, which is important. However, it is recognised that death squads operate there. If an action is not benign to the political regime of Brazil, people are taken out of circulation, so to speak. This also happens in Colombia, although the focus there is usually on drugs.</P>
    <P>Many people go each year to places such as Turkey, which has lovely holiday destinations, although the recent earthquake has focused negative attention on it. Turkey is a full member of NATO and it respects Partnership for Peace to which we will sign up in the near future. However, if people have political leanings which do not gravitate towards the centre of power, they are often tortured. It is important for such countries to clean up their act. That is why it is not too late, seven years later, to ratify the declaration and I compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation. This is important in the context of what has happened recently in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We get a lot of literature from Amnesty International. Were it not for Amnesty International, politicians and people would not know that human rights do not exist in many countries. That organisation must be respected. The annual reports published by Amnesty International make interesting reading.</P>
    <P>We have a good human rights record. That is why the punishment beatings and acts of torture which have taken place in the North since the peace process are not desirable. When elements in society become guardians of the peace, they drive people, particularly young people, from their homes because they have become involved in criminal activity. It would be wrong if this House did not condemn what is happening there. It is a contradiction to say we have a peace process when such acts are taking place.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of political prisoners in India, which is a powerful country, and European countries seem to be helpless in the face of what is happening in the former Yugoslavia. This Bill is timely because we now know that political activities lead to people being tortured in many countries throughout the world. Much work must be done to improve this unsatisfactory situation in many countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. It is unfortunate we have waited so long to deal with something so important. We always seem to be behind the door in committing ourselves to UN conventions we have signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Torture is a global problem of great magnitude. It is carried out systematically in more than 40 United Nations member states and is practised sporadically in many more. Many of the countries which have ratified the UN Convention Against Torture still practise or tolerate the use of torture. Consequently, every day new victims of tor<Col N="1407" /> ture are added to the already huge population of torture victims around the world. It is difficult to assess the exact number of victims. However, in January 1997 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that there were 13.2 million external refugees and 4.9 million internal refugees in the world. Many of these, who belong to the opposition or national minority groups, are torture victims. Prior to leaving their homes, they are persecuted and often tortured in police stations, prisons or detention camps. Studies indicate that 20 to 30 per cent of refugees are torture victims.</P>
    <P>We should also look at reducing world debt. A number of people have campaigned for the banks to write off Third World debt. Campaigners for urgent debt relief say that huge sums of money are going back to wealthy countries instead of feeding and educating children in the world's poorest nations. The money was originally borrowed in the 1970s and 1980s and was often badly invested or squandered. In many cases, the loan repayments are far beyond the nations' abilities to repay. In its 1997 report the United Nations Development Programme stated that governments in Africa alone, if relieved of their debt obligations, could use the funds to save the lives of millions of children by 2000. Countries cannot borrow additional funds for major investments until they repay the interest or debt outstanding. The banks should write off this debt so that countries can invest in infrastructure and basic services, such as water.</P>
    <P>While every country in the world, including the USA and Japan, owes money to someone, 41 countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia have been identified as being heavily indebted. Many have struggled for years to repay only the interest on loans that are in some cases decades old. The sums involved are vast. The main pressure group advocating dropping the debt wants $160 billion and $300 billion in unpayable debts wiped out by the end of the year 2000. We should support this call at the start of the new millennium. People in countries with a chequered history and with different Governments have no life. Some of them earn $1 a day. Their hope for the new millennium is for a new start and we should help to promote this.</P>
    <P>The debts are mainly owed to three groups &ndash; western Governments, global financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and private lenders. The world's wealthiest countries exert great influence over the decisions of the institutions because voting power is set according to financial contributions. At the IMF, for example, the USA has 18 per cent of the votes, while Mozambique has just 0.06 per cent. As a country which has campaigned for human rights and sent people across the world on charitable missions, we should fight to write off world debt.</P>
    <P>At the forefront of the campaign to drop the debt is Jubilee 2000, a coalition of non-govern<Col N="1408" /> mental organisations and religious groups. We must listen attentively to what they are saying because they are giving their time voluntarily to this cause. They see the inequalities and unfairness people are forced to live with. We are talking about human rights. Half of the nations still practise torture.</P>
    <P>At a human rights ceremony to mark the declaration's 50th anniversary, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson &ndash; she is doing an outstanding job and we should be immensely proud of her contribution during difficult times this year &ndash; noted that institutionally, much has been achieved. The concept of universal and indivisible human rights has attained legitimacy, officially at least. She wanted to know who could fail to be dismayed when we compare the reality of the human rights situation around the world with the idealistic aims of the universal declaration? She stated that &ldquo;the duty, under Article 14, to respect the rights of asylum-seekers is made subject to financial considerations&rdquo;. This is all about money.</P>
    <P>She also said: </P>
    <P>We dispense humanitarian aid to the victims of famine and conflict rather than addressing the human rights issues at the heart of their problems. A billion and a half people earn less than a dollar a day and the same number have no access to clean water. We are in danger of reaching a point where the world is divided, not between developing and developed states, but between overdeveloped and never-to-be-developed states.</P>
    <P>This is an important statement. Mrs. Robinson blamed &ldquo;a failure of will on the part of Governments&rdquo; that spend $800 billion a year on weapons. She said:</P>
    <P>We can, and must, do better. The credibility of our institutions of governance is at issue.</P>
    <P>The people asking for debt relief include Bono, who met the Pope recently, others in the artistic world and church leaders. Since 1996 international financial institutions have implemented a programme of debt relief. The initiative for heavily indebted poor countries is most important. The aim of the scheme is to cut, to sustainable levels, the debt of countries which show a sound economic record over a six year period. This is most important because it is not a case of writing off debt for its own sake. Some countries have massive debts which the banks are calling in and the question is, who is against debt relief? The big global lenders, including the IMF and the World Bank, are not against it; indeed, they are pursuing more debt relief. However, they argue that cancelling debt altogether would encourage wealthy countries to stop lending and to cut aid budgets still further. They also insist that they should not be blamed for the debt problem.</P>
    <P>The issue in not about apportioning blame, but the problem is that countries cannot pay the <Col N="1409" /> money which is outstanding at present. There are ongoing inquiries involving the banks in Ireland which show that when they realise they cannot get money, they write off amounts. The programme includes an assessment period of six years involving new reforming measures being implemented by Governments. This money would be wisely invested for the future and regardless of what financial punters might say, banks have no choice but to write off the debts.</P>
    <P>Some conservative opinion has been sceptical about the campaign. The London newspaper, <i>The Times, </i>denounced it as &ldquo;a senselessly impulsive gesture&rdquo;, saying that &ldquo;it could only ever provide a short-term sense of progress&rdquo;. However, debt cancellation is a solution to the problems of many countries which are in such huge difficulties. In Africa and Russia people live on a dollar a day, but Ireland has a massive economy at present and people are talking about a minimum wage of £4.40 an hour. People all over the world have no standard of living, no sanitary services and no water supplies. Ireland must encourage debt relief because indebtedness is torture. People are tortured by the fact that they do not have a way of life and no prospects of development. Ireland should promote the cancellation of debt by the major world banks.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to contribute to the debate. Many Irish people and charitable organisations have readily made themselves available to help people in times of need. However, we constantly hear about atrocities all over the world. Ireland's voice is important and I am delighted the Bill has been introduced. Ireland is recognised abroad as a country which speaks out on principled ideas and our ideals and opinions are respected worldwide. We have much to offer and there is a case for the abolition of debt by financial institutions, which are making astronomical amounts from interest alone, for the new millennium. They must make a statement, they should wipe the slate clean with regard to outstanding debt for the year 2000 and give these nations a new lease of life and new opportunities to develop. New procedures can be implemented and observed by the important institutions involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
      <P>I suspect we have been conditioned recently by television images of East Timor and Bosnia and previously by images from Vietnam regarding our understanding and perception of torture and the deprivation of human rights throughout the world. I commend the Government on introducing the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Copenhagen Appeal on 28 June 1994 stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to re-emphasise there can be no exception to the prohibition on the use of torture. No exceptional circumstance, be it a state of war, the threat of war or internal conflicts, can justify such an act which violates the most basic rights of the victim and which <Col N="1410" /> debases the person who performs it. The impunity enjoyed by the perpetrator all too often merely adds to the moral suffering of the victim.</P>
    <P>This is the context in which I wish to deal with the issues addressed in the Bill and our responses as a community. I pay tribute to organisations such as the Irish Refugee Council which has been active in promoting an understanding human rights and the issues surrounding torture. When I spoke to the Irish Refugee Council, I was surprised to learn that, by and large, refugees who come to Ireland tell stories which are difficult to understand. They try to block out their experiences as much as possible, but they still talk about the level of man's inhumanity to man. I understand the torture is generally against males although in East Timor and Serbia recently there was extensive use of rape as a torture weapon. It appeared to escalate beyond all proportion. I compliment the Government on sanctioning a grant of £300,000 to the Rape Crisis Centre in Dublin to promote programmes on understanding the problems of torture victims.</P>
    <P>Torture is rarely applied to extract information. In Bosnia and Serbia recently the torture was mainly pursued to deprive communities of leaders who were likely to provide a barrier against the inhuman regime that was trying to overcome the ethnic population. The victims of torture are usually highly educated. In African countries, Romania, Iran, Iraq and Russia, and in Nigeria and Somalia, where I understand it is particularly prevalent, torture victims usually have a third level education and considerable leadership potential. Ireland has dealt with programme refugees. In 1956 we took in Hungarian refugees while in 1979 we took in Vietnamese refugees. Recently, we took in Bosnian refugees. In each case, we did ourselves proud in providing education, health and general support services to these people who left their countries against their will.</P>
    <P>Regarding the rights of prisoners, the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders in 1955 stated:</P>
    <P>No prisoner shall be punished except in accordance with the terms of such law or regulation, and never twice for the same offence. No prisoner shall be punished unless he has been informed of the offence alleged against him and given a proper opportunity of presenting his defence. The competent authority shall conduct a thorough examination of the case. Where necessary and practicable the prisoner shall be allowed to make his defence through an interpreter.</P>
    <P>There is recent evidence that this provision is regularly flouted by repressive regimes in Eastern Europe, Africa and South East Asia.</P>
    <P>The rules also state:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> Corporal punishment, punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments shall be completely prohibited as punishment for disciplinary offences.</P>
    <P>There are no circumstances in which we can allow the use of such methods to continue. In 1998, the UN office in Geneva urged all parties to the convention on torture who had not yet accepted its optional provisions to do so as soon as possible, &ldquo;to ensure that torture is a crime in their domestic law and to rigorously pursue perpetrators whenever the act was committed and to bring them to justice&rdquo;. I am glad that we are doing so by adopting this Bill.</P>
    <P>The congress also urged all states &ldquo;to provide for compensation and rehabilitation of the victims of torture in their domestic law&rdquo;. We are beginning to take on board some of these measures. Dr. Chris Neilson at the Irish Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims and the Irish Refugee Council are beginning to do so and I am pleased they are liaising closely with the Eastern Health Board to provide proper medical and psychological services, a pool of translators and so on.</P>
    <P>The UN also called on all states &ldquo;to contribute to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture as fully and as often as they can&rdquo;. Countries which are better off than Ireland have not been doing so. Now that Ireland is relatively wealthy we must play our part in ensuring that UN and other funds are properly supported. The congress further urged that all states &ldquo;co-operate with the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture in fulfilling its mandate when requested to do so&rdquo;. One would wonder whether much progress has been made on this issue.</P>
    <P>The report presented by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on 28 June 1994 to the Copenhagen appeal stated:</P>
    <P>The Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims of Copenhagen has played a pioneering role in these endeavours and has inspired the creation of a network of such Centres throughout the world. [We are beginning to make a start here.] </P>
    <P>I therefore appeal to those Governments that are able to do so to contribute or increase their contributions to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture or to contribute directly to the Centre for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture in Copenhagen and elsewhere in the world. As far as the United Nations Fund is concerned, with some $2.5 million per year, it cannot at present respond to the many requests for assistance that it receives. A doubling of contributions, to $5 million by next year and $10 million by 2000, would make it possible to multiply activities aimed at effacing the physical and psychological effects of torture. It is also important that <Col N="1412" /> the work of physicians, psychologists and lawyers assisting torture victims be facilitated.</P>
    <P>This morning I received 70 pages of resolutions adopted by the medical profession at various congresses throughout the world. They make interesting reading. We need to go through these resolutions painstakingly to see how we conform and whether we are enabling the medical, legal and other professions to support the victims of torture.</P>
    <P>The UN report continues:</P>
    <P>I am firmly convinced that, in order to deal effectively with the scourge of torture, the best remedy is prevention. It is therefore essential to strengthen assistance and technical co-operation activities in this area. The training on international human rights standards of the police and armed forces, judges, lawyers and health workers is of crucial importance in that regard.</P>
    <P>We are taking much of the report's contents on board, but I am not certain that all of it has been fully understood. The report also states:</P>
    <P>The international community is about to enter its third millennium; a complete cessation of the practice of torture would affirm the moral conscience of humanity and would uphold the most fundamental principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Ending torture is the beginning of true respect for the most basic of all rights: the intrinsic dignity and value of each individual. I therefore call on Governments and those in a position of power and authority to do their utmost to put an end forever to this inhuman practice and truly affirm their respect for human rights everywhere on earth.</P>
    <P>The sentiments in this report are substantially reflected in the Bill. However, I wish to express concern at a practice recently brought to my attention by Amnesty International, namely, the introduction of chain gangs in Bristol County, Massachusetts, USA. This practice is regarded throughout the world as a humiliating and degrading way of treating prisoners and shocks us all. Massachusetts is one of the 12 US states which does not have the death penalty and it is extraordinary that it should introduce chain gangs while waiving the death penalty. I humbly call on the US Administration to look at this inhuman and degrading practice which should not be tolerated in a civilised society. I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I call the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell. The Minister of State is not replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not replying, Sir, I am making my contribution to the debate. As Minister of State with special responsibility for <Col N="1413" /> human rights I am pleased to see this Bill before the House. We in Ireland often congratulate ourselves on our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. Our responses to crises involving massive and systemic violations of human rights, such as those in East Timor and Kosovo, along with our long-term commitment to African development, are cause for justifiable pride. However, we must be vigilant in ensuring that our own house is in order.</P>
      <P>Our delays in passing legislation to enable us to ratify such core international human rights instruments as the convention against torture have led to some questioning of our right to criticise the actions of others when we have not made ourselves amenable to the standards and obligations imposed on us by the convention. I listened carefully to the Minister's opening statement and I join him in urging Deputies to bear in mind that 15 years have passed since we signed the convention. Therefore, the most important issue is to focus our minds on putting this situation right rather than dwelling on the reasons for the delay.</P>
      <P>Our legislative record on human rights is under close scrutiny on a number of fronts and for a variety of reasons. It is therefore crucial that we move in a determined and consistent fashion on this and other legislation which will soon come before the House.</P>
      <P>Ireland has not ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. Deputies are aware of the tremendous changes which have taken place in Ireland in recent years. The development of a multi-cultural society has been one of the most striking of these changes. The emergence of such a society presents challenges and great opportunities. We have seen positive and, sadly, some negative reactions to the arrival of people whose culture differs significantly from that in which most of us grew up. In order to equip ourselves to meet these challenges Ireland, in common with other modern states, must set itself certain standards and be prepared to justify its progress in meeting those standards before international bodies which can bring an objective, searching analysis to our actions or, sometimes, our omissions. That opportunity is provided by the international human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. To appear before the monitoring committees of the conventions against torture and racial discrimination is to participate in a procedure which, through dialogue, should lead to a better understanding of what we need to do to ensure that the provisions of these instruments are scrupulously honoured. Having appeared before the Committee on the Rights of the Child, I can vouch that these exercises in examination do not always lead to a pat on the back for governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in freely acknowledging the shortcomings which may be evident to detached observers such as the monitoring committees but which, for whatever reason, we ourselves have not dealt with, we enter into an engagement of <Col N="1414" /> integrity with the international community to rectify the faults, errors and omissions identified during the process of examination.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;international community&rdquo; has come in for some criticism and even derision in recent times because of the difficulties encountered in securing rapid, effective and co-ordinated action in responding to cases like East Timor and Kosovo. However, I am glad a debate has begun at the UN under the direction of the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, on the need for more efficiency and a more concerted effort by the international community in responding to such humanitarian crises. The dilemma of reconciling the need to protect human rights and uphold the principle of sovereignty and non-intervention is being teased out because of the great international disappointment at the failure of the international community to move more swiftly to prevent horrific loss of life in East Timor. However, the human rights monitoring mechanisms of the United Nations give those countries which have signed up to the core covenants and conventions the chance to stand back from the day to day business of reacting to events and to look at their track records with some degree of detachment.</P>
    <P>Human rights also form an essential part of the Good Friday Agreement. In this context, I know the Minister is preparing, with his officials, to bring legislation before the House which will give effect to the commitments we entered into when the Good Friday Agreement was signed. The Bill establishing a human rights commission in this jurisdiction and the introduction of proposals on the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law are now overdue.</P>
    <P>We must be mindful that we are under scrutiny also in regard to the progress we have made in fulfilling our human rights obligations under the Agreement. We can sometimes be complacent about our human rights record but in the past two years we have set ourselves some formidable tasks in establishing a level of protection of human rights which will be second to none. The setting up of a human rights commission and the possible incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights will not make life easier for the Government and its many agencies. However, that was not our intention. Rather, we are now embarked upon the enactment of a comprehensive body of legislation which will transform the human rights landscape in this country and place the vindication of citizens' rights in their own hands.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced by the Minister today is an important step on that journey. We must take that step and continue along that journey until we have accomplished the goals we have set ourselves in the protection of human rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could roll our cameras and sound systems forward to the end of the next millennium we might see people in these Houses <Col N="1415" /> debating issues and referring to times past. For many years, when we have discussed torture, we have spoken about it in the past tense. We were shocked at the exposure of the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. Many of us have read books about the Spanish Inquisition when exquisite &ndash; in the most painful meaning of that word &ndash; torture was inflicted on people in an effort to make them believe in the one true faith. We who live in this century stand indicted of allowing torture to take place despite our knowledge of what human beings can do to each other. These instances will, perhaps, be spoken of by people in this House in 500 or 1,000 years time and future Members will wonder how such things could have been allowed to happen at the end of the 20th century. It is painful for all of us to realise that, despite our knowledge of what can happen, people are being tortured even as we speak. People are have electrodes attached to them and are tortured because of their political beliefs, their religious beliefs, their ethnicity or because someone in the government of a particular country does not like their actions or their beliefs.</P>
      <P>This legislation, welcome though it is, is too narrow in its definition of torture. The Bill declares that &ldquo;a public official who carries out an act of torture on a person will be guilty of an offence&rdquo; and goes on to define torture as &ldquo;an act or omission by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person&rdquo;. I hope the Minister will clarify whether or not a public official who does not himself carry out the act of torture but has it carried out on his orders can be found guilty of an offence. I doubt if Hitler ever attached an electrode to someone's genitals or took a scalpel, cut open a woman's body and removed a living child from her womb without the use of anaesthetic. I doubt if Hitler would ever have been found guilty of such an act but he had many thousands of people carry out horrendous acts of torture on his behalf. I hope this legislation allows for the prosecution of such people.</P>
      <P>I travelled to Rwanda within a couple of months of the massive genocide which took place there. Many people who stimulated acts of genocide and torture will never be caught, found guilty of crimes or brought before the tribunal which is sitting in Arusha in Tanzania. These people will escape. Many of them now live comfortably in other countries. Many members of the clergy are living comfortably and are being protected by their orders in other countries. These are people who stimulated or coerced ordinary citizens in Rwanda to take large sharp machetes and hack people to death where they stood. They are acts of torture and genocide. People do not like to speak of these matters because they think acts of genocide and torture are only carried out behind closed doors and do not happen often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw the effects of torture. I remember standing in a food distribution line in Kigali, in <Col N="1416" /> Rwanda, when 20 young Rwandans helped me to distribute food, water and blankets to people who were returning from the camps in Goma. As people came to the front of the queue, the evidence of the torture they had undergone was visible on their faces and on their bodies. They had large slash wounds on their foreheads and their heads. One little ten year old boy stretched out one hand, and as I handed him something I said to him, in French, to use both his hands. To my shock, the little fellow took his other hand from under this T-shirt and showed me that he had only one hand. This ten year old had done nothing to anybody and yet a fellow-Rwandan had taken a machete and cut off his hand. The chances are this was someone who knew him. It may even have been a relative, but somebody who knew him had cut that little boy's hand off. I felt appalled by what I had done, the simplicity with which I had almost, in a frustrated way, said to that little boy, &ldquo;give me both your hands and you can carry what I am giving you.&rdquo;  We must face up to the reality that human beings are still doing this type of thing to each other and we must always be vigilant.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, we must be vigilant within our own State. I was once in the position the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in now and he will be aware, as I am, at first hand, of the sense that people sometimes get that any punishment is not too much for somebody who has committed a crime against them, that literally all bets are off, if somebody has been robbed or a member of his or her family murdered &ndash; it must be the most painful thing to have a member of one's family murdered. I can understand at a human level that one would want the most awful things to happen to the person who did that, but we are a democracy and a civilised people and we must be careful that we live by the rule of law and that whatever punishments we include in our law are punishments that are humane and appropriate to the crime that has been committed. That is why I and many others in this House wanted an end to the death penalty. I do not believe it is right that a state &ndash; public officials &ndash; should take a person's life. A person who has committed a heinous crime should be locked away for life, but we must also guard against mob rule and a reaction as a result of pain where somebody has suffered terribly.</P>
    <P>The definition of torture needs to be expanded in the legislation &ndash; maybe the Minister will tell me it has been expanded. Torture is not what we think of as the stereotype torture where electricity and clubs with nails are used or people are hung by their toe nails or their toe nails are pulled out. The term &ldquo;torture&rdquo; can also be expanded to include the rape of women prisoners and rape used as a war weapon. Female circumcision is torture. It is an appalling travesty against a woman's body and it is still inflicted on women in parts of the world. It may well be that in some religious practices it is considered right and proper, but I <Col N="1417" /> do not see it like that and we must speak out against it.</P>
    <P>The placing of mines indiscriminately all over countries is a form of torture. The pilot who flies a plane that drops newfangled mines, which can be showered down as if you were setting seeds, is committing a form of torture because the man or woman who walks into his or her one hectare tiny farm to plant food for his or her family may lose a leg or an arm or his or her life. The dropping of such mines is a form of torture inflicted not only on the person who is maimed or killed by the mine, who is probably the main keeper of a family of eight to ten children, but on the human rights of the people for whom he or she was caring. The destruction of whole areas of land in countries such as Angola, Namibia and Mozambique is a form of torture, mental and physical, to the people of those countries. I hope the UN will realise that because unless we realise what constitutes torture we will continue to cast aside some of the atrocities that are happening and say that they do not come under the definition. My fear is that people who have committed such atrocities, as in the case of East Timor, will walk free because while they come under the definition of genocide they may not come under the definition of torture.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will do what the Taoiseach announced recently &ndash; invoke the UN convention against genocide. He got plenty of positive publicity in the papers recently in calling for the invoking of that convention. The Taoiseach said the Government was considering invoking the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, but there seems to be some going back on that now that the UN force has gone in there. We should not go back on that commitment. Let us look at the help many countries are giving us to try to solve the problem in Northern Ireland, to try to prevent the killings we have lived with for the past 30 years, to try to end the torture and punishment beatings that are happening day in and day out. Let us stand up now and say that we will invoke this convention against the Indonesian Government for its actions in East Timor.</P>
    <P>It is only a few years since we were appalled and sickened by what went on in Rwanda, and now it is happening again. We all called for action after what happened in Rwanda, genocide of the most enormous nature, and now such genocide is happening again &ndash; we do not know the exact figure, but it will be in six figures when the truth is told. Having listened yesterday to journalists who did such an excellent job in East Timor, as soon as the militia had killed somebody, they went in, took the body and destroyed it. Being as crude as I can be, the head count of those who have been killed in East Timor, maybe after appalling torture, will never truly be known. From my travels in Africa and many other countries, I know it is very hard to get an exact fix on the size of the population of those countries. Censuses are very difficult to carry out. People live a nomadic life <Col N="1418" /> and sadly many children die, many before they reach the age of five, and they are never recorded in any census or anybody's book. We do not even know they have lived, they have left no mark on the human race except to their family who have buried them.</P>
    <P>The Government should have the courage to invoke this convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. Next week and the week after there will be another story and we will forget what has gone on in East Timor. Unless we, as a human race, learn from what happens, we will not be able to stand up and call for this type of legislation to be introduced.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International, the International Red Cross and the International Red Crescent have been to the forefront, over the years, in identifying where torture is taking place. I welcome the money the Department of Foreign Affairs is making available to East Timor, but it is very little. An allocation of £300,000 was announced yesterday. Deputy Carey said £300,000 was being allocated to the Rape Crisis Centre, but according to the news headline £300,000 is being allocated, of which £51,000 will be given to the Rape Crisis Centre to enable it to counsel women who have been raped.</P>
    <P>We know that rape has been all-pervasive in Europe, in the former Yugoslavia, and that it is still going on. I am deeply concerned that the effect of that kind of torture on women is not understood fully because most of the people who head up the organisations are men. One must talk to and face the women and girls who have been raped &ndash; some of them the victims of multiple rapes &ndash; as a weapon of war, to understand how utterly appalling it is. It is probably the worst form of torture because it is a very basic human act. To have sex with somebody is a very human act, it is something we all do, but to use that human act as a weapon of war is worse than some other form of torture because a women or a girl &ndash; some of them are very young &ndash; who has been a victim of this crime will never recover. At least &ndash; I do not say this in a light way &ndash; if one gets a machete wound and it eventually heals, one can continue and, hopefully, one's mind will not be too severely damaged by it, but the use of rape by soldiers, public officials and people who are fighting in a war is the worst form of torture. The use of rape by public officials and by those fighting in wars is at its worst ever.</P>
    <P>We must remind ourselves that as a small country we have benefited from those countries who are willing to look after our problems. While we have a good record in helping countries where torture, rape and genocide has occurred, we must have the courage to speak up at bodies such as the UN.</P>
    <P>At a AWEPA conference on refugees in June 1997 in South Africa, a Burundian MP spoke very movingly of what happens when torture, genocide and the rule of democracy breaks down. Referring to his country he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> The lack of protection and the respect of human rights and fundamental liberties is an obvious and direct cause for Burundians to go to exile. Horrors, killings, massacres and assassinations have been committed against innocent citizens, particularly during the 1993 and 1997 crises. More than 20 members of the Parliament of the sitting legislature were killed between '93 and '96.</P>
    <P>The Government took up office in 1997. I ask the Minister to imagine the horror if there was torture and genocide in this country which had denuded the Government or Opposition benches of 20 elected Members? It is necessary to think about it in those terms. Some 20 members of the Burundian legislature were killed between 1993 and 1996 and thus far, no legal action has been instigated against the perpetrators. The MP went on to say:</P>
    <P>Prisons are full of more than 9,000 political prisoners. Old people, children and women are innocently killed with impunity during the army-FDD confrontations. Humanitarian assistance is not enough, either inside the country or in places of refugee. Schooling and health care are almost absent. A lot of refugees die in exile. Three members of Parliament have recently died in Tanzania and Congo.</P>
    <P>That list of horrors occurred not during the time of the Nazis or the Spanish Inquisition but two or three years ago, at around the time the Government took up office. We must be mindful of the nearness and ever-pervasive use of torture, genocide and punishment and the lack of human rights.</P>
    <P>In enacting this legislation I hope the Government will do what the Taoiseach appeared to indicate and have the courage to stimulate the use of the convention against East Timor on the prevention of punishment and the crime of genocide. Otherwise, in a month or a year we will be debating another atrocity and saying it happened before in East Timor, Yugoslavia and Rwanda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo, the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill, 1998, because it will finally establish that Ireland will not accept or tolerate torture, will not harbour torturers and will not put anybody at risk of torture by sending them back to another country. The Bill allows us to recognise that torture is the gravest violation of human rights and we, as a civilised society at the end of this century, should be doing all in our power to prevent it. We have a very good record in this regard since the foundation of the State but it is proper that it should be written into law and I welcome the Bill for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Torture is, unfortunately, used worldwide to suppress opposition, but it is always used against minorities and very vulnerable groups. The minorities include women in some cases, young <Col N="1420" /> people and especially those who hold different political or religious views. Often human rights activists, those who stand up for justice, are tortured most. That this exists and that we have allowed it to continue for so long is a sad indictment, not only on developing countries and those led by dictators, or those in transition from dictatorship to democracy, but also on most of the western and democratic world.</P>
    <P>Through the centuries we have always heard of torture. Our knowledge of it in Ireland goes back to Cromwell. It has always been evident, but with technological advances the kind of physical torture exerted on people today cannot be traced and the mental and psychological pain inflicted on people can never be measured.</P>
    <P>The UN Convention on Human Rights, which sought to outlaw torture, was signed only after ten years of debate. That raises questions about the commitment of some countries to outlaw torture throughout the world. Our signature to the convention and the introduction of this Bill at least show our commitment, irrespective of the fact that it has taken some time.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates a specific offence of torture, which is especially welcome because it brings within the jurisdiction of the Irish courts those responsible, irrespective of their nationality or of the jurisdiction in which the torture was carried out. Regardless of where in the world the torture was committed, the perpetrators can be brought to justice here. The fact that they can get life imprisonment is an indication of the seriousness with which we judge torture.</P>
    <P>Given what Deputy Owen said, I am especially interested to note that under section 3, the Hitlers and other dictators who sit in their offices, and majors at the base who aid and abet torture, can also be brought to justice. Not only that, but they can be held equally liable to the same penalty as other perpetrators. Too often the foot soldiers are held to blame when they are often working under the orders of the leader.</P>
    <P>The definition of torture is that set down by the UN. I am interested to note that it encompasses not only physical and emotional torture but also inaction and neglect. Torture by neglect could mean ignoring a plea for medical attention, treating somebody in a degrading manner or not attending to their needs by turning a blind eye. That could happen in a police station or anywhere throughout the world. In accepting these aspects the definition is broad in so far as it covers actions and inactions, physical and emotional.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also welcome because it brings us a step further to implementing the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report on non-fatal offences against the person, which says that the creation of a specific offence of torture gives concrete effect to the principle that it constitutes a serious violation of the right to bodily integrity and merits punishment in our criminal courts. Anything in our legislation which recognises human rights and which can ensure that <Col N="1421" /> people are brought to justice for violating them is a welcome step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>A number of different groups worldwide &ndash; Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and others mentioned in this debate &ndash; work to protect human rights, outlaw torture and bring cases to our attention. The last report of Amnesty International said that despite all the talk and our knowledge and awareness of human rights and torture, people are still being repeatedly tortured and ill treated in 117 countries throughout the world. They are not being tortured by neighbours or opposition groups but by security forces and state authorities in their own countries. It says that 41 countries, including the US, had proven cases of torture, ill treatment, lack of medical care and cruel and degrading prison conditions. All these have been confirmed or suspected of leading to people dying in custody. These are people who are in the hands of the authorities which the public would trust.</P>
    <P>There are another 31 countries where people have disappeared. This constitutes a torture not only on the persons themselves but on their families. We have seen evidence of extrajudicial executions, unfair trials and death sentences. Ireland has abandoned the death penalty and I join the calls on other countries to abandon it also. It serves no purpose but adds an ill to another ill.</P>
    <P>Human rights abuses are carried out in a deliberate and systematic way. They are carried out in the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. We could list many more countries but these are the ones which have come to our notice because they are the countries from which we have received refugees. We have also received reports from Irish aid agencies which operate in these areas. We have close links with many countries throughout the world and we should raise questions about their practices. India, for example, has thousands of political prisoners and we constantly hear reports of torture and of people being denied medical treatment. I particularly wish to refer to religious practices against women in India, to which Deputy Owen also referred. The violation of a woman's body is the greatest torture and it seems to happen as if it were part of that country's culture rather being seen for what it is, a violation of human rights and the torture of young women.</P>
    <P>Sometimes civil war in a country is offered as the reason for torture taking place. Civil war is not an excuse for a country such as Colombia, for example, where security forces and paramilitary groups, with the support of the state, carry out abuses and where death squads are sent to dispose of people whose only offence is to oppose the government. It is impossible to bring a case against them in court so the easiest option is to make such people disappear or to kill them.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected to this House, I have had the privilege of visiting China and Iran, two countries where I question the abuse of human rights. In China, we raised the human rights issue and the reports we had received. We were not given <Col N="1422" /> honest answers and I was not satisfied. However, it is important that Irish delegations continue to raise these questions with the Chinese, who are anxious to secure investment and to demonstrate that they are democratic, and to show that we will not tolerate these abuses. We should not forget that it is only ten years since the events in Tiananmen Square. Looking at film footage of that event, which was recently shown again on television, one is reminded that democracy is a long time coming to China and will also be a long time taking effect.</P>
    <P>Brazil is the eighth largest economy in the world. Are some of the more powerful countries too slow to react to human rights abuses in countries such as Brazil because of the strength of their economies? More particularly, one can look to the situation in East Timor. I commend the work of the Government, particularly of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, in highlighting the issue of East Timor. However, I read today that the UN is now talking about moving into East Timor and administering the area at a cost of £1 billion. Could that have been avoided if the UN had moved in more quickly? I accept that a country must invite the UN to come within its borders and that invitation was eventually forced from the Indonesian Government. However, it was too late. The damage was done &ndash; torture had been inflicted and human rights were violated. We must take a moral stance. We will play our role; it will not be long before the blue berets are in East Timor. However, we cannot stand over the genocide taking place there and we must constantly highlight it.</P>
    <P>That is equally true of our dealings with countries such as Turkey which is seeking full membership of various European bodies. I question whether Turkey is a fully functioning democracy when all we hear is reports of torture. Is that country upholding human rights? Our knowledge of these countries is gleaned from immigrants and refugees, and many of the refugees are victims of torture. It is not easy to recover from torture. The psychological stress and the long-term effects require assistance and rehabilitation. I hope the Minister, in his work with the refugees, will ensure that this care and attention is given, particularly to women. I commend the allocation of funding to the Rape Crisis Centre. However, there is a need to train health personnel to recognise where torture has taken place, to give them the skill to deal with it, to give them the information about where cases can be referred and to help them ensure that the victims can be assisted.</P>
    <P>Ireland prides itself, on the basis of Article 40 of the Constitution, on upholding human rights. There is a prohibition of inhumane treatment in this country. Indeed, the Judges' rules for prisoners clearly set out guidelines for the interrogation of prisoners, taking of statements, confessions and so forth. The Minister's initiative in providing for the videotaping of evidence will ensure that there never can be any questions in this regard in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> However, do we have to look far in this island to see torture taking place? Punishment beatings take place in Northern Ireland. A punishment beating is a torture and it is not acceptable. It is not acceptable under the British-Irish Agreement and it is not acceptable from the point of view of basic human rights. A close eye must be kept on this matter. The British-Irish Agreement aims to protect and strengthen human rights and the human rights commission is a step in that direction. There were many submissions to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights from various bodies on that issue. This Bill, in conjunction with the other measures being introduced, will ensure that human rights are upheld and violations such as torture will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Ireland is moving towards meeting all the steps in Amnesty International's 12 point programme against torture. We have fulfilled many of them. The first point is official condemnation and Ireland has done that through signing the convention. We particularly fulfil it today in ratifying the convention. Amnesty International seeks limits on incommunicado detention; in other words, people must be allowed to make contact with others to seek help. That is the case when people are arrested in this country. There should be no secret detention centres, something Ireland can also stand over. There should be proper procedures for interrogation and custody. I have already referred to these and welcomed the Minister's initiatives in that regard.</P>
    <P>Another point in the programme is independent investigation of reports and that no statement extracted under torture can be used in legal proceedings. There are very strict rules in this country regarding the type of statements that can be admitted in court. Torture should be prohibited in law and that is the step we are taking today by creating the offence of torture. Another point is that torturers should be brought to justice and that will be the result of passing this legislation. Amnesty International also points to the training of officials to deal with people, another issue that will be covered by this Bill. Victims should also be entitled to compensation and rehabilitation. I hope that in our dealings with refugees we will give them such assistance and rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The eleventh point is that governments should undertake an international response and intercede with other governments. Ireland is doing that with regard to East Timor and other countries and we can be justifiably proud of our record in this regard. The final point is the ratification of international instruments. International instruments, UN documents and Council of Europe, NATO, PfP and European Union instruments, conventions and reports can be ratified, signed and debated but unless they are put into effect we will discover in the 21st century that we have learned nothing from the Enlightenment when <Col N="1424" /> the concept of the rights of man was articulated because we will not be upholding those rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is, overall, progressive and much needed legislation. Bodies such as Amnesty International who are expert on human rights violations have also welcomed the legislation, particularly that it establishes jurisdiction in Irish courts over torture suspects irrespective of nationality and, second, that it amends the extradition legislation to prevent anybody who could face torture being extradited.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International's latest annual report lists 125 countries guilty of torture and ill treatment and states that in 51 countries such ill treatment by security forces, police or other state authorities was confirmed as or suspected of leading to deaths. However, the Green Party is concerned that what we have here today is the Irish brand of ethical foreign policy where we approve conventions against torture while at the same time approving export licences to supply military components and weaponry to countries which employ torture against their own people. Figures from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment show that 346 military export licences and 712 dual use export licences were issued by the end of November 1998. Recipients included such countries as Singapore, a known conduit of arms diversions to Third World countries, Malaysia, the Balkans, Serbia and Montenegro in August 1998, Nigeria, Saudia Arabia, Peru, Chile, Brazil, Algeria and Angola. Most of these countries have, to say the least, a fairly dodgy human rights record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party is opposed to the arms trade. Ireland should not be involved in this disgraceful trade. Apparently the Government is not properly vetting where these arms and components are going. The Irish Development and Human Rights Group, AFrI, which has published a ground-breaking study on the Irish arms trade, have highlighted the activities of a number of companies. I will give two examples. Moog Ireland based in Cork makes, among other things, electronic controllers for a range of main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and anti-aircraft guns, including the Bofors L70 air defence guns, the type used by the Indonesian armed forces. Many crocodile tears have been shed here today. We need less crocodile tears, less hypocrisy and a little more consistency. The Indonesian army went out and slaughtered East Timorese, yet we are approving arms exports. This is a matter that needs to be addressed in this House. Moog has received £4.4 million in grant aid from the IDA as part of its expansion programme. Another example is Kentree Limited, Kilbrittain, County Cork. It has in the past exhibited at the major Copex Arms Fair in Britain, an arms fair described by the campaign against the arms trade as &ldquo;a marketplace for electro shock batons and other torture equipment&rdquo;. The 1994 Copex catalogue lists Kentree as &ldquo;an industrial partner in the design and manufacture of equipment for the <Col N="1425" /> police, military and nuclear markets&rdquo;. What will the Government do about this problem?. Perhaps it believes a thriving Irish arms industry and arms trade will be of assistance to Ireland's new role as a partner to NATO. This, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is the reality of NATO's Partnership for Peace. We are getting into bed with some very nasty customers.</P>

The question I would put to him and to other so-called Fianna Fáil dissidents is, on the day where will they be?

We could be on joint exercises with members of the Turkish army in the Curragh. Perhaps they could give us a few tips on torture techniques. That is the sort of link I am attempting to make and it is a very valid point. I hope I will be allowed to expand on that. Why is the Government willing to co-operate militarily with NATO, a military alliance based on nuclear weapons? Why does it believe this will not compromise Ireland's neutrality? Does the Government support NATO? The explanatory guide quotes NATO's launch document for the PfP in which NATO states that &ldquo;active participation in the Partnership for Peace will play an important role in the evolutionary process of the expansion of NATO&rdquo;. Does the Government favour NATO expansion? President Clinton cited the PfP as &ldquo;a path to full NATO membership for some&rdquo;.</P>

It is all very well to come in here and ratify conventions, albeit 15 years too late, but there is hypocrisy involved in that &ndash; on the one hand, we are becoming involved in the arms trade which facilitates torture and, on the other, we come in here and sign these conventions as if it is nothing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, you are. I tried to make these points when discussing the Amsterdam Treaty. I will make a few further points if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me. No other Member has been interrupted. I heard the Deputy from Sligo making a few points about world debt; that is all very well and I welcome that. I am asking the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to facilitate me. It is interesting that in the Government's explanatory guide in relation to PfP we signed up to the Petersberg Tasks. Article J.7.1 of the Amsterdam Treaty encourages member states to co-operate in order to develop the European arms industry and armaments policy. It states: &ldquo;The progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported as member states consider appropriate by co-operation between them in the field of <Col N="1427" /> armaments.&rdquo;  In the context of the Titley report of the European Parliament this provision has serious implications for Ireland which has a small but growing arms industry. This has been referred to in the AFrI report.</P>
      <P>The annual production of defence equipment in the European Union amounts to approximately £40 billion which is 3 per cent of annual industrial output. The industry employs 600,000 people directly and 400,000 indirectly. Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Sweden, some NATO members and some PfP members, account for 90 per cent of the EU arms trade which has a 20 per cent share of the world export market for major conventional weapons. However, the Titley report makes clear that there has been a cutback in orders for military equipment, leading to fierce competition, especially with the US. A previous speaker &ndash; a Deputy from Cork &ndash; made reference to the United States. Some of us here are supposed to be anti American, but we are not. What we are saying, however, is that the United States is a major arms exporter and has facilitated torture. That is the point I am trying to make.</P>
      <P>The Titley report states, in article 1:</P>
      <P>Neither the European defence identity nor the common foreign and security policy of the EU can be credible without a strong European armaments industry.</P>
      <P>It further states, in article 3:</P>
      <P>A European armaments policy would be easier to pursue if there was a consensus on the major objectives of a common foreign and security policy.</P>
      <P>There can be little doubt that one of the main reasons for having a common foreign and security policy, which would be greatly strengthened by the Amsterdam Treaty, is to expand and develop the European arms industry. It gives a clear signal that such an expansion would occur in Ireland as well. That is also the signal that is being given out by us in joining the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now address the Bill directly. A number of points need to be made and perhaps the Minister can clarify them in his reply. One point, which was raised by Senator Ryan in the Seanad, concerns a definition in section 1(1)(b) &ndash; there is a caveat in it &ndash; which states &ldquo;but does not include any such act that arises solely from, or is inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions&rdquo;. That is something we need to be a little wary of. Perhaps the Minister can clarify this point, but it almost sounds as if a sanction is part of the law of a given country then it does not actually amount to torture. For instance, in Saudi Arabia people have their hands amputated as a punishment. Does that amount to torture? I would say that it does. Deputy Owen referred to female circumcision. In certain countries it would be seen as traditional, but <Col N="1428" /> does it amount to torture? I would argue that it certainly does.</P>
    <P>Section 2 defines torture in terms that everyone would agree with but there is another point concerning section 4(1) which states:</P>
    <P>a person shall not be expelled or returned from the State to another state where the Minister is of the opinion that there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.</P>
    <P>There are countries where torture is endemic &ndash; one such being Nigeria. It puts the Minister in a difficult situation. If an individual who is going to be sent back to Nigeria claims that he will be tortured there, how will the Minister judge that? How will he calculate what is in fact a substantial risk? That would cause a certain amount of alarm among those who are seeking asylum in this jurisdiction. I know of cases where people have pleaded with the Department of Justice, Equality, and Law Reform claiming that if they go back to this country they will be tortured and in many cases they have not received a very sympathetic hearing. Perhaps the Minister will give some guarantees that he will look sympathetically on all those cases concerning countries where torture is endemic.</P>
    <P>I wish to go on at greater length about the links, but obviously I will be reprimanded for that, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. However, you are on the record now as having said that I will have an opportunity to speak next week. I will take you at your word and I hope we will not have any squabbles next week when I am trying to make my points.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe I welcome the legislation. I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in expediting the legislation which I understand has been in preparation for some time. As has already been mentioned, it gives effect to the United Nations Convention Against Torture. For many years the United Nations debated this particular issue and Ireland always played a leading role in those discussions. The convention, which was finally adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1984, sets down the precise modalities for dealing with the situation concerning torture. It was ratified by the Government in 1992 when I was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. Given that such conventions take time to prepare as they involve difficult and painstaking procedures, it is timely that we should be debating this Bill at a time when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Council of Europe. Ireland will take over the presidency of the Council of Europe at the beginning of November.</P>

    <P>The legislation amends existing legislation, including the Extradition Act, 1965, the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1994, the Defence Act, 1954, and the Criminal Procedure Act, <Col N="1429" /> 1967. In this regard, it can be seen that the changes being enshrined in the legislation are desirable and will fit into the overall concept of what the UN Convention Against Torture hopes to achieve.</P>
    <P>Since the convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly, and ratified by this State and others &ndash; and despite all the international efforts to counteract it &ndash; we have still seen some pretty horrific cases of torture taking place. We have seen ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina and it has surfaced also in other places in recent years. The Council of Europe spent almost two years trying to avoid a situation which was threatening Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Despite the best international efforts we still had an outbreak of the most horrific torture and degrading treatment in those countries. The same thing is going on at present in places like Sierra Leone. In passing this legislation we need to redouble the efforts of the international community in combating torture. We need to play a leading part in international affairs &ndash; as we have always done in the past in the United Nations and the Council of Europe &ndash; to ensure that we are to the forefront in efforts to prevent and eliminate, in so far as it is possible to do so, the kind of situations we have seen in the last year or so and which are currently taking place internationally. These are the type of situations where strife, torture, death and destruction have wrought havoc in countries and put enormous pressure on the international community.</P>
    <P>In keeping with our policies in this regard, it is the Government's intention to join the Partnership for Peace. I cannot reconcile the attitude that is being adopted by people who say we need to provide more funding and support for the United Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian efforts that Ireland is involved in, including overseas development aid, while at the same time they resist being part of a partnership which is designed specifically to avoid such situations arising. I see absolutely no contradiction in being part of a Partnership for Peace which is designed to provide peacekeeping assistance and advice and guidance to help people avoid situations such as those which occurred in Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina and East Timor. Membership of the partnership is designed to eliminate and, in so far as is possible, eradicate such situations.</P>
    <P>There are those who claim to hold the high moral ground in relation to East Timor, Bosnia, etc., while criticising our involvement in the very service which would help to eliminate the hardship created for people in those countries. I cannot follow their logic and I cannot understand why people like the previous speaker are so opposed to joining Partnership for Peace, which is specifically designed &ndash; without affecting our neutrality or obliging us to become part of NATO or other alliances &ndash; to be part of an arrangement which would provide protection for the people who are suffering the most severe hardship, deprivation and torture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> While serving as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid I witnessed the torture people were forced to endure in places such as Tanzania. The people to whom I refer were suffering from mass starvation &ndash; they were dying not because they were being tortured but because of a lack of food. The death rates among young people and children in that country were alarming and frightening. Everyone has seen reports about these situations in the print media and on television but one has to experience them firsthand to see the hardship, deprivation and torture visited on people in Tanzania due to a lack of food. They are the poorest of the poor.</P>
    <P>In that context, our ratification of the UN convention by means of the Bill affords us the opportunity to redouble our efforts in respect of peacekeeping and peacemaking and in the provision of additional resources and funding to support the overseas development aid programme so that we can help to eliminate torture and inhuman and degrading treatment endured by people in many countries. The international community, by means of this convention, can play an important role in ensuring that the hardship endured by hundreds of millions of people can be reduced or eliminated.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask a number of questions about Bill. Will the Minister, if the information is available to him, indicate whether the convention contains a reporting mechanism whereby reports can be sent to individual member states in respect of the workings of the convention and whether its operation is proving successful? Will he also indicate whether Irish personnel will be involved in the operation and implementation of the convention? It is fine to introduce and ratify conventions but it is very important to have follow-up mechanisms in respect of them. We should receive a report &ndash; perhaps not on an annual basis &ndash; or an indication from the United Nations on the effectiveness of the convention in dealing with the problems which necessitated its introduction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, for his dedication and commitment to expediting this matter at a time when Ireland is about to assume the Presidency of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their kind remarks and I express my appreciation to those who contributed so constructively to the debate. This is an important Bill and the tone and content of the debate was very constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone will agree that words cannot adequately express the total abhorrence we feel about the misery and suffering inflicted on the countless victims of torture. As legislators, we naturally wish to play our part in bringing to justice those who are responsible for these horrendous crimes. It goes without saying that it is important that we are in a position, as quickly as possible, to ratify the UN convention by bringing <Col N="1431" /> forward this legislation. I am pleased to have been able to do so. There is validity in criticising the delay in bringing forward the legislation, given that Ireland signed the convention in 1992. I can only say that, in the context of my extensive programme of law reform, I gave the legislation considerable priority.</P>
    <P>Examples were given during the debate of atrocities which have been committed in various parts of the world. The House will appreciate that, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it does not fall directly within my brief to comment on these matters but I assure Members that the concerns they legitimately expressed about specific international human rights issues will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>A number of the issues underlying the legislation have been highlighted by the Pinochet case. That matter was raised some time ago in this House when the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out that abuses of human rights in any country are of concern to the entire international community. He reminded the Dáil that during the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, Ireland strongly condemned the violations of human rights carried out by that regime. While the Minister believed that the perpetrators of all human rights abuses should be brought to justice, he indicated that this could only be done in accordance with the jurisdiction and laws of the country concerned or within the framework of specific international legal instruments. The House will understand why I am reluctant to comment on the case currently before the English courts. My officials will, of course, monitor developments in respect of that case in terms of the consideration of the legal issues involved and any possible implications for the Bill before us. I would make the point that according to Article 29.3 of the Constitution, &ldquo;Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States&rdquo;. Obviously, Irish courts would have regard to this in considering cases which may come before them where such considerations arise.</P>
    <P>To return to the more general issues raised by the Bill, the House may be aware that the Law Reform Commission, in its report on non-fatal offences against the person, stated that the creation of such an offence in domestic law would give concrete effect to the principle that torture constitutes a serious violation of the right to bodily integrity, which warrants special prohibition and punishment in the criminal law. It would also lend consistency and coherence to Ireland's condemnation of the practice of torture elsewhere. The commission recommended that consideration be given to the creation of a specific offence of torture, thereby also facilitating Ireland's accession to the UN convention. That is precisely what the Bill before the House does.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> I fully accept that criticism by us of the behaviour of other states in the area of human rights can sound hollow if our record in our jurisdiction can be called into question. Like other Members, I believe this country's human rights record has been good &ndash; not least because for over 60 years the citizens of Ireland have been protected by a bill of rights, namely, Bunreacht na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Significant developments are under way in respect of the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction, particularly in the context of the British-Irish Agreement. Under the Agreement, the Government has undertaken to further strengthen the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction. Deputies will recall from the Agreement that the Government's commitments in this regard extend to bringing forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights, drawing on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights. The question of incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law must also be further examined in this context. In addition, the Government as undertaken to establish a human rights commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that of the Human Rights Commission recently established in Northern Ireland. My Department was assigned a lead role in respect of formulating proposals on these commitments. The question of incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into our law has been examined in the Department and I intend to bring proposals on the matter before Government shortly.</P>
    <P>As regards the establishment of the human rights commission, the Government published the text of the Human Rights Commission Bill in July. The functions of the commission, which will be an independent body, will include keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights, bringing court proceedings or providing assistance to persons in human rights cases and conducting inquiries in relation to complaints about infringements of human rights.</P>
    <P>Today's debate has been extremely useful. As indicated at the outset, the views expressed will be considered fully before Committee Stage. At this stage, however, I will refer briefly to a number of the comments made by Deputies. A number of Deputies referred to punishment beatings. While they do not come within the technical definition of the Bill, I agree that a clear message should be sent from this House that punishment beatings are wrong. They should stop now. No man or woman has the right to be judge, jury and/or executioner in such matters. I deplore these barbarous attacks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the phrase &ldquo;does not include any such act that arises solely from what is inherent in or is incidental to lawful sanctions&rdquo;. This is taken from the convention. Impris<Col N="1433" /> onment may, by itself, cause an individual severe mental pain and that is a type of exception which would be at issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins asked when the Bail Act, 1997, will be brought into operation. The House will be aware of my intention to bring the Bail Act into operation once sufficient accommodation has been provided by the prison building programme. I find it rather ironic that people who call upon me to halt the prison building programme at the same time request me to introduce the Bail Act. It must be clear to everybody at this point that if there is not a sufficiency of prison accommodation, one is not in a position to implement the Bail Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Happily, there will be additional prison accommodation available in the not too distant future which will facilitate the introduction of the Bail Act, which I will be only too pleased to implement. Specifically in this context, when the Cloverhill remand prison and the Midlands prison are in operation, which will be very soon, it is my intention to bring the 1997 Act into full effect.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue Deputy Howlin raised in connection with the importance of article 10 concerning training and education of law enforcement officers, I agree this is an important subject. We have already in place strict regulations on the recruitment of persons for custody and high standards in the training of enforcement officials. I will ensure that this training will include appropriate reference to the Bill when enacted.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to extending the definition of torture outside the definition contained in the Bill. As I indicated in my earlier contribution, I accept there may be varying views as to how precisely to define the offence of torture but primarily what is at issue here is to enable the State to ratify the UN convention and, in the circumstances, there are obvious advantages in adhering as closely as possible to the definition contained in the convention.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen expressed concern that those public officials who do not directly carry out acts of torture but rather ensure that acts of torture are carried out would be covered by the Bill. As Deputy Hanafin said and I am happy to confirm to the Deputy, as provided in section 3, it shall be an offence for a public official to direct, instruct, aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of the offence of torture. In addition, a public official who conspires to commit the offence of torture shall be guilty of an offence under this Bill. Furthermore, a person who carries out any of these offences shall be liable to the same penalty, that is to say imprisonment for life, as principal offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen was concerned that the definition of torture should be broad enough to cover such outrageous behaviour as the use of rape as <Col N="1434" /> torture. The definition of torture in the Bill is very broad and it includes both mental and physical torture. In that respect it is clear that it would cover the use of rape as a weapon of torture as defined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley asked whether, for the purposes of section 4, I would take into account the existence in a State of a consistent pattern of torture. I would draw his attention to section 4(2) which specifically provides that the Minister shall take into account all relevant considerations, including the existence in the state concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies raised the Pinochet case. With regard to war crimes Ireland has legislation in place now to ensure that we can fully co-operate with the established international war crimes tribunals. This is something which is of considerable importance in that it allows us to send fugitives to these tribunals.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Gormley's assertion that he met people who said they did not get a very fair hearing in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to allegations that they would be subjected to torture if returned to certain countries, all I can say is that I am totally mystified as to where the Deputy got this information. Ireland adheres fully to the 1951 Geneva Convention. Ireland has a considerable body of legislation on its Statute Books to ensure that people always get a fair hearing when they apply for asylum. Indeed, representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees mentioned to me some time ago that the procedure which Ireland now has in place for dealing with such applications could become a model for asylum applicants throughout the free world. In those circumstances, somebody is badly misinforming Deputy Gormley. Not only are the hearings fair, open and transparent, people are entitled to appeal and there is always recourse to the courts. There is also a prohibition on returning any individual in any event to a country where he or she would be subjected to torture. Furthermore, there is a prohibition on returning people to a country from which an individual could be returned to a country where that individual could be tortured. Spurious allegations are flying around and they have to be nailed. They are completely untrue.</P>
      <P>That completes my reply to the Deputies. I trust I have covered at least some of the more important points.</P>

      <P>I refer Deputies to my replies to Questions Nos. 705, 710, 716, 720 &amp; 721 of 29 Meán Fómhair last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Asgard</i> Restoration Project, or ARP, has made an application for a licence, under the National Monuments Acts, to alter the original <i>Asgard</i> in order to refit it for sailing. This vessel is currently stored at Kilmainham Gaol and is in the ownership of the Minister for Defence. In accordance with standard practice I sought the advice of the National Museum of Ireland on the application as the <i>Asgard</i> is considered to be an archaeological object as defined in the National Monuments Acts by virtue of its historic associations. I understand that in order to fully consider the application for a licence the National Museum requested additional information last January from the applicants. The additional information sought was received in July by the National Museum, which then proceeded to examine it in detail. A recommendation has been <Col N="1436" /> received in recent days from the National Museum by my Department.</P>
    <P>I should explain separately that the waterways and industrial archaeology committee of the Heritage Council met with the ARP in late 1996 and indicated its support for the project. However, in December 1998, the Heritage Council's chief executive advised me of the council's intention to form a working group to re-examine the issue, as it is statutorily entitled to do. This working group was comprised of representatives of the Department of Defence, my Department, the National Museum of Ireland, the ARP and the Heritage Council, with an independent chairman, Mr. Peter Delamer. I am advised that the group met on three occasions and made a report to the Heritage Council on its findings. The Heritage Council wrote to me on 30 March 1999 stating that the council, having considered the working group report, now recommended that the ideal solution for the boat was its full conservation, display and interpretation as a land based exhibit in a suitable location.</P>
    <P>The advice from the National Museum and the other advice and views in the matter will be taken into consideration by me in the coming weeks in arriving at a considered decision on the application for a licence. My role in the vessel's future at this point is strictly confined to deciding the issue in relation to the licence to alter it under the National Monuments Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The ARP restoration committee outlined the three possibilities that exist &ndash; full seagoing status, display in a maritime setting or a land based museum exhibit. Articles written about this famous yacht indicate that it is not just stored in Kilmainham Gaol, where it was ignominiously lifted over the wall on its last journey 30 years ago but that it is now decaying. The Minister for Defence, who has responsibility for the <i>Asgard</i>, has already indicated his willingness to put up £250,000, which the ARP is willing to match pound for pound. This would allow the <i>Asgard</i> to be redisplayed in a maritime setting. Surely, given its history, its architectural and archaeological importance under the appropriate Acts and its part in Irish history as well as the fact that it is a yacht that was built to sail, it should now be preserved in a maritime setting for the next 50 years. Irrespective of the advice the Minister receives, will she make a decision to back up her colleague and allow this licence so that the ARP can do its job at no cost to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I concur with the Deputy that this vessel is of particular historical significance and I also agree that this issue should be addressed without undue delay. It is important to have a decision as the Deputy is right in saying that while the vessel is stored in Kilmainham, it certainly needs immediate attention. I accept that and the Deputy is also right in saying that the owner of the vessel is not the Minister for Arts, <Col N="1437" /> Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands but the Minister for Defence, who has made his views on this matter known. My role as Minister relates to the licence and to obtaining all views. Obviously there is tremendous interest in this historical artifact and letters have been written to me from home and abroad about it. I want all the information from the public and from such organisations as the Heritage Council and the National Museum. As I said, I have only recently received the National Museum's final report and to be fair to all concerned, as this is a rather complicated debate, I want to give due consideration to the points put forward by all sides. There is no question of delaying this decision. I agree with the Deputy that it is important a decision is made so that the matter can be taken forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>What proportion of the timbers of the <i>Asgard</i> are original timbers? In the context of a full restoration to seagoing standards, how many of the present timbers would need to be replaced? Regarding the future of the <i>Asgard</i>, has the Minister looked at the possibility of the future exhibition of the vessel as a land based museum exhibit? On the other hand, bearing in mind the <i>Asgard</i>'s importance not just in the context of Irish history but in its design and because of its famous builder, an exact replica of the <i>Asgard</i> could be made available for seagoing activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Shea says, the options are to build it to sail in a maritime setting, as Deputy Kenny suggests, or make it a land based exhibit, and a further option is to make an exact replica. I must consider these options in granting the licence, that is the nub of the issue. With regard to the timbers, I am told if we go that route that extensive work would have to be done and, again, we would have to examine this. A number of people have raised the issue of costs but that does not come under my responsibility as Minister; it affects those directly involved in the project and the Minister for Defence. Deputy O'Shea has outlined the options which I must consider and I have only recently been in a position to make that decision. I assure the Deputy it will be made without undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour the Minister granting a licence to the ARP and the Minister for Defence putting up £250,000. It is well accepted by international experts that the best preservation method for timbers on sea-going craft is in a maritime setting. The cost to the Minister or anyone else in having a land based, climatically controlled exhibit would be in excess of £100,000 per year. The Government's philosophy is, in part, in favour of public-private partnerships. In this case, interested people with a great deal of experience are willing to raise £250,000, supported by the Minister for Defence, if this Minister gives a licence, and they will use the craft and keep it in a maritime setting where it can remain for the next 50 years. At that point, a future Minister &ndash;<Col N="1438" /> be it the current Minister or whoever &ndash; would be able to maintain it as a land based exhibit from then on. For the moment, its future should be in a maritime setting. I thank the Minister for agreeing to tackle this urgently because it has gone on for long enough. She has all the information and I urge her to decide about granting the licence as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say this to delay matters but given that the <i>Asgard</i> belongs to all the people of Ireland, it would help the debate, and help the Minister in arriving at her decision, if the specialist information available to her were made known to the public, and if the public were invited to make its views known to the Minister. The <i>Asgard</i> is unique in our history, a feeling of ownership of the ship should be cultivated and that should be the background to her decision.</P>

I assure the Deputy that in coming to my decision I will take into account the views of constituents, in the broadest possible sense. Those who are interested in this matter and have written to me will have their views taken into account, as well as the more scientific and specialist approach. I must take both on board and I intend to do so without further delay.</P>

      <P>The protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities. This is reinforced in the recently enacted Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999. My role is mainly to provide advice to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions. It would not be feasible to provide protection for the nation's architectural heritage through a programme of acquisitions. The best solution is to see continued use of buildings suitably safeguarded using the new powers under the Act. My officials have, however, recently made contact with representatives of the construction company in relation to the monastery chapel to see how best this important building can be protected for the future. At this stage it is not possible to say what the outcome of these discussions might be.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy does not need to be told that the Taoiseach is aware of and takes great interest in everything that happens in and around his constituency as well as in the nation. This is a building of note, we must consider this issue carefully and we are doing so in conjunction with the construction company. I mentioned the new Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, which will come into effect on 1 January 2000 and will be administered by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and will go a long way towards protecting such buildings. However, this is of such particular national concern that we should examine what use can be found for the building in the long-term in the context of protecting it. The issue of acquisition is under immediate consideration.</P>

This chapel and monastery was designed by the great ecclesiastical architects Ashley and Cole- man and are not just of national but of international importance. I am also glad the Minister referred to the powers under the new legislation because I do not want another Sandymount to happen here. Under the existing legislation the chapel demolished in Sandymount should have been preserved for some future use. One does not want the Taoiseach to be finishing a pint of Bass in Kennedy's pub after a busy week&mdash;</P>

The Minister should make no bones about this and, in the context of the advice received from her Department, she should ensure that this monastery of the enclosed Redemptorist Order, a unique piece of architecture, is maintained and preserved in some fashion for future generations.

I would like the local authority to show an interest as it is a principal organ of development in this area. I know it has responsibility for many other buildings but this one should not be lost. I urge the Minister, through her good offices and the power she has with Dúchas, to ensure that whatever is necessary is done, with a reasonable developer and in the context of the architecture of the other buildings. We do not want another Sandymount church on our hands. As we enter the final months of this millennium it would be a national disgrace to allow an example of international architecture to deteriorate before our eyes.

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Heritage Council report on archaeological features at risk. It brings a new focus to the problem of the destruction of archaeological monuments which has been a source of concern to me and to Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. I acknowledge that the increased pace of land use change and development has created a potential threat to archaeological remains. Mindful of this, the archaeological survey of Ireland which is undertaken by my Department has been used as a basis for the identification and statutory protection of known archaeological sites. Section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, provided for the establishment of a record of monuments and places, otherwise known as RMP. This record has recently been completed for the whole country and provides for comprehensive legal protection to be extended to all recorded monuments, which number about 120,000 for the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The record for each county consists of a set of ordnance survey constraint maps with an accompanying index which shows the location of monuments and places which are protected under the Acts. These are publicly exhibited at various venues around each county, such as local authority offices, county libraries, farm development services and Teagasc offices. Notice of these venues is given in both local and national newspapers. The listing of a monument in the RMP requires anybody proposing to carry out works which in any way interfere with the protected site to give my Department two months written notice of such intention. A person contravening these provisions shall be liable to severe penalties under the Acts.</P>
      <P>The National Monument Acts 1930 to 1994, enable me to intervene in any case of threat to a monument which comes to my notice and, if necessary, to pursue the matter through the courts. A number of such cases have recently been actively pursued. I am currently looking at means by which services provided by my Department's regionally based staff in other fields, for example, nature conservation, can be extended to include some monitoring of archaeological sites. I hope to make practical arrangements to this end in the near future in consultation with relevant staff interests. I also see some scope in developing alliances both with local authorities and other local interest groups whereby they could assist in keeping a watch over archaeological sites and monuments at local level. These and other initiatives will be explored further, in consultation with the Heritage Council, in the context of the proposed national heritage plan which I intend to publish next year.</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was prompted by the report completed by Muiris Ó Suilleabháin from the National Heritage Council which showed that in 600 square miles up to 17 per cent of the recorded monument were either seriously damaged or had disappeared, principally due to more intensive methods of farming or speculative developments. How many staff from Dúchas monitor this? Has the Minister applied for extra staff to ensure the relevant section of the 1994 Act is implemented? When drafted, that Act was deemed to be one of the best in Europe but without resources it is useless. Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development about releasing the information on every townland which is available in his Department? Many farmers do not appreciate the full significance or the importance of the archaeological and recorded monuments on their property and this information would create a momentum for them to be preserved.</P>
      <P>There is a huge constituency interest in preserving these recorded monuments, many of which are thousands of years old. For example, in the Burren in the Minister's constituency, copies of Poulnabrone monuments are being erected as tourist attractions. Has the Minister applied for extra staff? What staff are available in Dúchas? Has the Minister spoken to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development about releasing information so that those who own property on which these monuments are erected understand that the full rigours of the law will be applied and that it is in everybody's interest that they are retained and preserved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for improved statutory protection was recognised which is why the record of monuments and places was established and this was completed in 1998. As I said, it outlines the monuments which come under such extended protection. As regards the Deputy's question about giving information to those most interested, mainly farmers who have monuments on their land, this is available, along with maps and surveys, at various venues which are easily accessible locally &ndash; local authority offices, county libraries, farm development services and Teagasc offices. As I said, notice of these venues is given in local newspapers. People can go to these venues, look at the maps and obtain the necessary information.</P>
      <P>With regard to staffing, we need a monitoring system which ensures protection is enforced. It is one thing to have legislation but it is another to ensure it is enforced. I referred to how I am examining ways of doing this. A number of approaches could be taken, such as asking the Minister for Finance for extra staff and funding. However, I intend to take the faster approach of examining the services provided by regional staff, such as nature conservation staff, to see if it is possible to include the monitoring of archeological sites. Obviously, I cannot do that without consulting the relevant staff which I intend to do.</P>

      <P>During the period January 1998 to date, Dúchas, the heritage service division of my Department, has received 65 requests from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, seeking advice on sites for waste disposal and a further 216 inquiries relating to integrated pollution control licences, otherwise known as IPC licences.</P>

      <P>What guidelines does Dúchas follow when it visits these sites and is any local historical information gathered?</P>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with a local problem in County Clare where we are looking for a site for waste disposal. An intense examination was done of the Kilmaley site but only a peripheral examination was done of the Inagh site where there are many historical details, particularly a cillín, which was used when people were evicted from the church and their land. What guidelines are given to Dúchas? Is there a specific timeframe in which to do this examination? What type of experts are used? Do they consult with the local historians and local people? People in Inagh are dissatisfied that Dúchas approved that site without knowing the history of the area.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the issues the Deputy raised as we share the same constituency, Clare. I assure him that there are specific scientific criteria to which the members of Dúchas must adhere. They are professionals who do a job and compile a report.</P>
      <P>The site at Kilmaley was one of the sites put forward by the county council as a possible location for a dump. On examination, it was discovered the site had a number of monuments, therefore, it was not appropriate to locate a dump there. As regards Inagh, I agree with the Deputy that local knowledge is important. He made reference to a cillín, which is a children's grave. It was brought to my attention by the local residents that there may be a cillín on the site proposed for the dump in Inagh. As a result, I asked Dúchas to make the necessary inquiries, to look at the site, to make its scientific assessment of it and to report to me. It told me there was no evidence of a cillín. It recognised that the local people believed there was a cillín but it said it did not believe one existed on that site.</P>

      <P>Tá na hiarratais istigh agus glactar le hiarratais go leanúnach. Tá na hiarratais á mheas agus á gcur in ord tosaíochta an t-am ar fad. Má bhíonn airgead breise ann bainfear den liosta de réir an ord tosaíochta atá ann cheana féin. Tá an t-ord tosaíochta sin bunaithe ar cé chomh dona is atá an bóthar, faid an bhóthair, an méid daoine atá ina gcomhnaí ar an mbóthar, aois na ndaoine sin agus rudaí mar sin.</P>

      <Quest>if she will make a statement on the report of the film industry strategic review group published on 4 August 1999; the proposals, if any, she intends to bring forward arising from the report of the group; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I established the film industry review group to carry out an objective evaluation of the effectiveness of existing schemes and incentives to develop the industry, to analyse and identify the fundamental issues facing the industry and make recommendations in relation to future measures in support of the film industry, and to formulate a strategic plan for the future of the industry into the next decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> The group has now reported back to me having carried out its mission. I published the report in August this year and allowed a period for the receipt of public comment on it. The report is a solid and practical, yet inspirational, document which is the product of a year of intense work. The conclusions and recommendations of the report, together with the submissions received from the public on its content, will form the basis of the proposals to Government that I am at present formulating. These will determine the course to be followed to thrust the industry forward to the next decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister her views on two of the main conclusions of the film industry strategic review group. The first conclusion is that the driving force for the strategic development of the industry must be strengthened. What is the Minister's view of the kernel point that the Irish Film Board must be strengthened and restructured? What is the Minister's view of the point made forcibly in the report that the section 481 tax concessions should remain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the tax concessions, I presume the Deputy is referring to section 481 which was known as section 35. As I have said on a number of occasions, I feel strongly about this issue. The section has been of great benefit to the film industry and I intend to put it forward as a strong recommendation to Government. It is one of the 21 recommendations contained in the report and I intend to put it and a number of the report's other recommendations forward. This will happen soon because I am already formulating papers on this issue which will go to Government for a decision.</P>
      <P>The issue of the strengthening and restructuring of the film board is referred to at length in the report. There are a number of excellent suggestions with regard to how and why it could and should be done. I concur with many of the views expressed in the report. It is important to be in a position to strengthen the industry and I will put forward these recommendations to the Government in due course, perhaps next month.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that broadcasters give opportunities to independent producers. As we have known over the past few years, and particularly in the last year, the indigenous industry has been going in a positive direction. We want to encourage this and, as the Deputy is aware, I have acknowledged it in the Broadcasting Bill which I hope will be discussed in the House in the coming weeks. It contains a reference to the independent sector and the responsibilities of our broadcasters with regard to our independent sector. I concur with the views expressed by the Deputy and those expressed in the report of the strategy review group that it will play an important part in the industry over the next ten years and longer.</P>

What was the outcome of her comments and statements in respect of section 481 and the general expansion of the film industry in Ireland following her visit to Los Angeles?</P>

      <P>At a recent meeting of the Atlantic region biogeographical seminar Ireland agreed that it needed to increase the number of special areas of conservation being transmitted to the EU. My officials indicated that some sites were under appeal and that an additional 128 sites had recently been advertised. I will ensure that other sites which qualify under the EU habitats directive will be transmitted to the EU as soon as objections by landowners to the inclusion of their lands in these sites are dealt with through the appeals system. I received a list of a large <Col N="1452" /> number of suggested sites from the IPCC.

      <P>As I said in my reply, the IPCC indicated other sites it would like to see included on the list. My officials are looking at this issue to see if any of the sites warrant inclusion. We acknowledge that Ireland has some of the most pristine bogs in Europe and it is essential that they are preserved. In the same way, a balance has to be struck between rightly preserving such bogs and the number of bogs concerned. I am satisfied that the number of bogs designated will be accepted under the EU directive. We have some of the best examples of such bogs. The Deputy is aware that it is not a question of allocating every raised bog in the country, but of taking the best examples of such bogs. That is what will go to Europe and will be agreed under the directive.</P>

The Minister of State and I have been very open in putting forward our proposals and we believe the package is fair.</P>
      <P>The list of sites to be given to the Commission is not yet complete but we wish the Commission to understand that we will implement a programme. In order to bring about that programme, the Minister of State and I had discussions in Brussells where we explained that we wish to have co-operation in every sense. We believe that understanding and co-operation from landowners and land users is the best possible way forward for conservation. I acknowledge, as we acknowledged at the recent seminar, that we must transmit further sites and we have every intention of doing so once the appeals have been dealt with.</P>

      <P>The Arts Council published its second arts plan covering the period 1999-2001 at the end of July this year. The plan sets out, on pages 28 and 29, the budget requirements for its implementation over the period in question. The Government has approved the plan and will be providing the necessary funding to facilitate the Arts Council to implement the plan in full.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not consider the plan, as adopted by Government, to be very vague, general and loose in its interpretation of a range of issues? Should it not contain a specific schedule of commitments to be complied with each year? Will the Minister arrange for a discussion on this subject in the House? This is an area of increasing importance but because of the nature of Question Time and the fact that we cannot question the activities of the Arts Council, many Deputies who may wish to discuss these matters do not get an opportunity to do so. Will the Minister arrange to have such a discussion?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned by last weekend's newspaper reports of serious divisions in the Arts Council where there is said to be low morale and a great deal of tension? If such reports are true and the engine of the Arts Council is not functioning properly, the arts plan as adopted by Government will be implemented either very badly or not at all.</P>

      <P>The council is statutorily independent. The Deputy, who has years of experience in Government and Opposition, will understand that meaning of that. It would not be appropriate at all to interfere. I am sure the Deputy would be the first to raise the question if a Minister were to interfere and he would be perfectly right to do so. The plan was drawn up following a great deal of consultation. I do not accept the Deputy's view that it is general or loose. Before the plan was conceived the first arts plan was reviewed and its weaknesses and strengths examined. A very extensive consultation process took place among arts practitioners and the general public. The arts plan was drawn up on foot of that consultation and the implementation of the plan will be a matter for the Arts Council itself, not for me.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is himself in danger of getting a yellow card. There are still substantial barriers facing the development of the arts in Ireland. The purpose of the arts plan is to identify these barriers and address them. The legal position is that the implementation of the arts plan is the responsibility of the Arts Council. Before the plan was drawn up I commissioned a report from Indecon and Pricewaterhouse Coopers to see how best we could go forward on foot of the experience of the last plan. The Government would like to see further emphasis on the regions. The first arts plan made reference to this but we wish to develop that, as well as issues pertaining to the Irish language and the disabled. The establishment of strategic partnerships may be the way promote the arts at local and regional levels. That is alluded to in the second arts plan. It is also most important that the Arts Council move from being broadly a funding agency to become a more focused developmental agency.</P>

      <P>The meeting referred to by the Deputy was the Atlantic Region Biogeographic Seminar held at Kilkee in early September. I am aware of the comments and I hosted a dinner for the participants. The outcome of the meeting was not unexpected as my Department has yet to transmit a full list of Irish sites to the EU Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that to date I have transmitted a total of 145 SAC sites to the European Commission and I will be transmitting more when a number of appeals against further designations are resolved. My experts who attended the meeting freely conceded that more sites need to be transmitted and this will be done. I reject any suggestion that serious concerns were raised. It would be more correct to say that I and my Department brought the matter to the attention <Col N="1456" /> of the EU last March and set out a programme of work to ensure that our obligations are met. I was joined in this, obviously, by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The Commission and I believe that the successful establishment of the Natura 2000 Network is dependent on the active co-operation of landowners and land users. I, therefore, do not propose to transmit a site to the Commission until the appeals outstanding on it are completed.</P>

      <P>The Commission has made its views known on this. It would like to see a full list and we explained to it that was the reason the Minister of State, my officials and I went to Brussels. We were most concerned that NATURA 2000 would be successfully established and the way to implement that was through co-operation with landowners and land users. We put forward a programme, which we discussed at that meeting and the Commission is aware of our priorities in that regard. It is also aware that we are doing our best to ensure that we bring about a situation where all the sites can be listed with it. When the next Atlantic Regional Biographic Seminar is held in 2000 I expect the Irish list will be sufficient to meet the obligations under the directive.</P>

When the Minister was in Opposition she cast doubts every day on whether SACs should be established and her Minister of State whipped up hysteria in Connemara with the result that even today some farmers doubt whether SACs are of any value to them.</P>

This will help to make clearer, in a practical way, the kind of compensation proposals that will be put in place for farmers, and this was done with this issue in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Cunard Liner <i>Carpathia </i>was wrecked off the south-west <Col N="1458" /> coast of Ireland in 1918. I understand that she was torpedoed on 17 July 1918 lies in approximately 150 metres of water some 100 miles southwest of Baltimore, County Cork near George's Channel. Her main claim to fame is that she was the ship that came to the rescue of the <i>Titanic </i>in 1912, saving 700 of the passengers.</P>
      <P>Under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, on account of the historical, archaeological or artistic importance of a wreck, which is less than 100 years old, I may make an underwater heritage order to designate an area of the sea bed around where the wreck is located as a restricted area within the territorial waters of the State or an area to which section 2(1) of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968 applies.</P>
      <P>I should inform the Deputy that discussions are taking place under the auspices of UNESCO on a draft Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage, which proposes to give coastal States jurisdiction over underwater cultural heritage on the Continental Shelf. However, discussions are only at a preliminary stage and a number of States have expressed opposition to this proposal. Taking this into account, I do not propose at this time to consider placing an underwater heritage order on the site of the wreck of the <i>Carpathia.</i>I have had no discussion with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources regarding the <i>Carpathia. </i>I would, however, mention to the Deputy that general matters relating to salvage and wreck in the State are governed by the Merchant (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, the administration of which primarily rests with my colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. That Act imposes legal obligations on anyone who finds and takes possession of any wreck outside the State and brings it into the State, the obligations in respect of unclaimed wreck being to deliver it to the receiver of wrecks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that information. The <i>Carpathia</i> used to leave Derry to sail to New York subsequent to the <i>Titanic </i>tragedy. Will the Minister outline the law of the sea on the rights of salvage? Once the wreck has been identified and found, the stories about its potential cargo may be revealed by the owners who are now maybe salvage hunters. Will the Minister clarify why she considers she should not introduce a restricted order for the area of the sea bed around the wreck, given that it has a place in naval and maritime history, an involvement with this country and is a very famous liner in its own right? Is it likely she might reconsider that decision and introduce a restricted order, given that this is an ojbect of archaeological importance and is likely to become a site of growing importance which people will visit in the future?</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern about this matter because this ship is of historical interest. Some people might say that, given that an order was placed on the <i>Lusitania </i>why can an order not be placed on this ship and why the inconsistency, but there is a difference between the two. The wreck of the <i>Lusitania </i>lies 11 miles off Kinsale and is clearly within the State's territorial waters, but that is not the case with the <i>Carpathia. </i>The discussions taking place with UNESCO at present are with regard to matters concerning jurisdiction. There are legal difficulties and these have to be sorted out and for that reason I do not wish to make a decision until we are aware of what is happening at UNESCO level. As I pointed out in my initial reply, some States do not agree that such action should be taken but we will try to sort this out and then we could well be in a position to make such an order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment. I must declare a personal interest in this matter since not only do I know many of the employees at Oxford Health Plans in Mullingar but my daughter is also an employee. The shock announcement of the closure of this plant came as a major surprise to the people of Mullingar and the surrounding areas. For the 125 workers at the plant the announcement, and the manner of the announcement, was something nobody could have envisaged.</P>
      <P>This plant operated efficiently and effectively and was held as a model of productivity within the Oxford Health Plans Company. For some employees the first inkling of a problem at the plant was when access codes to their computers failed this morning. For others the news was relayed to them by way of a news bulletin on RTE, which was unacceptable treatment of the workforce and is to be regretted. The employees deserve much better treatment.</P>
      <P>Oxford Health Plans first opened its doors in Mullingar on 19 January 1998. It started with 40 staff and the number increased to approximately 180 this time last year. The company had received a very high profile from the IDA. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Public Enterprise attended the announcement of its entry to Mullingar in October 1997. The IDA generously grant aided it to set up in Mullingar and I now call on it to review this investment and establish whether refunds are payable.</P>
      <P>The company attracted high profile and high quality employees. Many left positions in other companies in the expectation that the company could provide them with a quality and permanency of employment that would last for years to come. Some even returned from abroad to work at the plant. For many employees this was the only source of income for their families and they were totally dependent on it. Many ancillary jobs providing supplies to the plant will also be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the heartbreak and disappointment of the employees who find their jobs gone today. It is especially sad that the closure should occur within a few weeks of Christmas and the new millennium. It is important to note that these jobs are gone through no fault of the employees, but rather they result from a management decision taken thousands of miles away in America. I call on the Government and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employ<Col N="1461" /> ment to take all necessary steps to find a replacement. The premises is magnificently fitted out and is ideal for a similar type company or a call centre. I assure the Tánaiste that there is a well trained, skilful and responsible staff available to work for any new company wishing to establish in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>Mullingar and the midlands have had their share of job losses in the recent past with the closure of Tarkett less than 12 months ago and other closures in County Longford. Indeed, Mullingar lies within the Objective One area. I am confident the IDA should have no difficulty marketing this location and I will be very disappointed if a new company is not found for this premises before Christmas. I also ask the Tánaiste to favourably consider Mullingar for decentralisation. Some headquarters should be located there in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise in the House this evening the shock announcement by Oxford Health Plans to immediately close its claims processing facility in Mullingar, which was only opened in January 1998. It dealt substantially with medicare claims processing. Coming so soon after the recent announcement of a company closure in Longford, with the loss of 112 jobs, it is a bleak few weeks for the north midlands. When one thinks of black Friday, 23 October 1998, when Tarkett announced the closure of its factory in Mullingar, with the consequent loss of 141 jobs and numerous indirect jobs, the month of October has been cruel to the economy of Mullingar and the north midlands.</P>
      <P>The Oxford Health Plans closure is of seismic proportions and the fact that workers, including Deputy McGrath's daughter, who gave loyal service to the company over a 21 month period, only found out they were being thrown on the dole queue on the radio news this morning compounds their deep sense of hurt and betrayal. Surely in this day and age employees deserve to be treated better.</P>
      <P>On the news pictures today we saw the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Public Enterprise touring the factory only two years ago &ndash; I am glad the Minister for Public Enterprise is here this evening. It represents a poignant reminder of how suddenly investment has turned sour for the workers through no fault of their own. The question must be asked how and why could such a project, which we all greeted as important for Mullingar, be the source of such great heartache and disappointment in such a short time?</P>

    <P>When we think of the 125 employees we must reflect on the human dimensions. Many workers are supporting families, paying mortgages and making huge sacrifices to provide their children <Col N="1462" /> with a third level education. Other workers were looking forward to securing and establishing their first homes to rear their families. Many other workers were young people who found their first job there and thought that, unlike countless young people from County Westmeath, they would have the opportunity to work and live in their own county without resorting to emigration. These people's lives and ambitions have been shattered by this sudden and unanticipated announcement.</P>
    <P>Some of the workers to whom I spoke this morning had no inkling that their jobs would disappear so quickly. I trust the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will ensure that the company will meet all its contractual obligations and financial liabilities and that all the employees will receive appropriate and generous redundancy payments and other compensation to help them over the next few months to discharge their commitments while they set about securing alternative employment.</P>
    <P>The operation employed people from Mullingar and the surrounding areas. The closure represents a significant blow to the industrial base of the Mullingar area and necessitates immediate attention from the Tánaiste, the IDA, FÁS and other agencies. Securing a new investment for the plant is essential. Mullingar is an excellent location on the Dublin corridor with a well developed infrastructure, boasting a highly skilled and educated workforce with a proven track record.</P>
    <P>I understand the IDA is speaking to a number of companies and hopes to secure alternative employment. I hope the discussions, which are at an advanced stage, will come to fruition and that the Tánaiste will ensure that every effort is made over the coming weeks to finalise a deal for a new investment for Mullingar.</P>
    <P>An inter-agency group was established to formulate a response to the closure of the Tarkett plant in Mullingar. That group should be immediately re-established to examine and respond to the needs of the employees of Oxford Health Plans and to examine ways to promote priority action and job creation in Mullingar. The group should meet immediately and set about securing alternative job creating enterprise, both from overseas and indigenous investors.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to give due recognition and support to indigenous industries who want to set up locally and to actively promote Mullingar as a location for a new investment. I also request the relevant agencies to provide immediate skills assessment and suitable retraining opportunities for those workers who have lost their jobs today and for the hundreds of other people in Mullingar who are struggling to make ends meet on the dole.</P>
    <P>We need to secure industries which will be long term in nature. I again appeal to the Government <Col N="1463" /> to consider favourably the case made by Mullingar as an ideal place to decentralise a Department or semi-State agency when deciding its new decentralisation plan. I understand it is currently being examined by the Minster of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen. Despite its central strategic location, Mullingar has been by-passed when previous decentralisation proposals were considered.</P>
    <P>This is the second time in 12 months we as Oireachtas representatives had to raise the matter of a major factory closure in Mullingar. Given the severe damage such closure can inflict on a local economy it is essential that every effort is made by the Tánaiste, the IDA and the other agencies working together to boost the local economy and provide jobs for the skilled and dedicated workforce in this area.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies McGrath and Penrose for sharing their time with me. I also thank my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for attending the House to answer this matter. I am glad of the opportunity to inform the House that the three elected Deputies for the constituency of Westmeath are making a combined effort to address this matter. We are not proceeding in a divisive manner but with the aim of getting a replacement industry.</P>
      <P>The shock felt by the employees of Oxford Health Plans must be huge.</P>
      <P>I came home from Luxembourg last night and there was a message from the Tánaiste asking me to telephone her. When I did, she told me the news. She had learned it yesterday.</P>
      <P>No matter how eminent a firm is or how well it has treated its employees &ndash; I understand this company treated them well in the 21 months it was there &ndash; it is incorrect to treat employees in such a fashion that they learn from the radio and television that they no longer have a job. Deputy McGrath informs me that when the employees went to work their computers were logged off, which confirmed that they had no jobs. This approach would never have been right at any time but in this day and age it is despicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand this has happened due to uncertainty in the American market about Oxford Health Plans. That, as somebody said, is far away from here but it is not far away when it has implications for one's job, salary, mortgage, children and other commitments. These are domestic matters which are not at all far away. The Tánaiste <Col N="1464" /> spoke to me again this morning and I will be meeting with her again. I told her that the Deputies for the area, who are present for this debate, want a replacement plant or firm as quickly as possible. I believe it can be done but I hope it is done quickly.</P>
    <P>I also urge that certain standards should be applied to firms which receive funding from the IDA or Enterprise Ireland &ndash; indeed, this could apply to any firm &ndash; whereby they are obliged to maintain standards when they, unfortunately, encounter rocky times. Those standards include a decent timeframe for informing employees about such developments. I urge that a replacement company is found as quickly as possible for this fine facility in Mullingar.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, for her views. I share the Deputies' concern and disappointment over the recent decision by Oxford Health Plans to discontinue operations in Mullingar with the loss of 135 jobs. I am conscious of the effect this will have on Mullingar and, most immediately, on the employees concerned.</P>
      <P>If memory serves, Oxford Health Plans considered my constituency as a possible location for its operations. When it opted for Mullingar, people in Louth were disappointed. However, that disappointment is tempered by recent developments. I empathise with the Deputies and with the people of Mullingar. I know what it is like to lose an industry in this manner. People are informed at the last minute and everybody else appears to know other than those most affected. The same thing happened a number of years ago when I was on the Opposition benches. To be fair to all concerned, there is no easy way to announce a decision such as this and, obviously, these decisions are not taken lightly.</P>
      <P>Oxford Health Plans is a US public company which employs approximately 6,000 people, primarily in north eastern USA, in the provision of managed health care. In October 1997, the Government approved a proposal by Oxford Health Plans to establish a claims processing operation in Mullingar. It was targeted to employ 500 people by the year 2000. Employment peaked at 187 in late 1998 and the operation currently employs 135 people.</P>
      <P>At the time of the Government approval, Oxford Health Plans was the fastest growing company in the managed health care industry in the US and was ranked fifth in the Fortune 100 list of fastest growing companies. It was financially strong with consistent profit performance above the industry norm. Its employment targets for the Mullingar operation were considered conservative relative to its projected growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> However, Oxford Health Plans has been experiencing difficulties for some time now. It has been losing market share and, as a result, has been downsizing. Over 500 jobs have been lost in its US operations in recent months. IDA Ireland was aware of these developments and has been monitoring the situation closely. It has been in regular contact with the company, including the parent company, in an effort to persuade it to maintain the Irish operation. On the recommendation of the IDA, the Tánaiste also made representations in this regard. Despite these interventions the company has decided to close the Mullingar operation with immediate effect as it now has an overcapacity for claims processing.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste met with the company yesterday. It explained that this decision was necessary as part of its need to continue its internal restructuring to recover its business and cope with the ongoing decline and loss making it has been experiencing in recent times. The company assured the Tánaiste that it will give every support to the workforce to find alternative employment and has offered an exit pay package to them to allow time to seek new employment.</P>
    <P>Oxford Health Plans has also committed to meeting all its liabilities to IDA Ireland and will give every support and assistance in finding alternative business for the facility in Mullingar. IDA Ireland is actively working with potential investors to acquire the Mullingar facility for a new international services operation. I am optimistic that these talks will conclude successfully in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Indeed, IDA Ireland has been most successful in recent times in attracting inward investment to Mullingar. The Tánaiste announced, on 18 May 1999, that IDA Ireland had successfully reached agreements with the Taiwanese public company, Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Limited of Taipei, to establish two industrial projects in Mullingar which together involve investment of more than £8 million and will lead to 500 new jobs over the next four years. In one of these projects, the new company Foxteq Engineering (Ireland) Ltd, will invest nearly £4.5 million in establishing a facility to manufacture enclosures for some of the leading personal computer manufacturers, mainly Dell and Apple. The company expects to create 350 jobs within the next four years.</P>
    <P>The second project, Foxconn Ireland Ltd., will employ 150 people over the next three years. It will involve £3.5 million investment in facilities to establish the company's first European design and low volume production centre for specialised electronic components, including cable assemblies and connectors. Over one fifth of the employees in this project will be third level graduates with particular technician skills in IT design.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also active in the region. In November 1998, the Tánaiste announced an expansion by Genesis Fine Arts which produces <Col N="1466" /> a wide range of cold cast bronze figurines for sale to both domestic and export giftware markets. The new expansion will create an additional 32 jobs, bringing total numbers employed in the company to 74 within a four year period.</P>
    <P>Everything possible will be done by FÁS to enhance the Oxford Health Plans workers' prospects for re-employment. Given the continued improvement of the economy, the ongoing efforts of the State agencies and the commitment by the company to give every support, I am confident that the workers will not have too much difficulty in finding alternative employment.</P>
    <P>I wish to apologise for the non-attendance of the Tánaiste at this debate. She asked me to speak on her behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for being present. The recent review of the widow's-widower's non-contributory pension is most unjust. About 850 pensioners in receipt of a British widow's or retirement pension are being reviewed. These widows and widowers are receiving a reduced Irish pension already and they will suffer a further reduction because of the cold hearted attitude of the Department.</P>
      <P>Due to the strength of sterling, the widow's pension is being reduced accordingly. Many of these widows have approached me. They are most upset and correctly point out that when the punt was stronger than sterling the Department was not sympathetic to them then and did not review their Irish pensions accordingly. In this time of economic buoyancy, it is disgraceful to reduce their pensions.</P>
      <P>Recently I met two of these pensioners and I have received telephone calls from others. The first pensioner was eligible for the old age non-contributory pension as she was over 66 years of age. However, as it was not to her financial advantage to progress to the old age non-contributory pension, she remained on the widow's pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of those who receive letters from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs indicating that they are reviewing their books find it quite intimidating given that many of these pensions are reduced already on the basis of the UK pension. This lady was in receipt of £60.50 which was reduced by £26 to £34.50. That was a drastic reduction for someone who was in receipt of an ongoing Irish pension and a UK pension. Both these people, who were the losers in this arrangement, pointed out to me that they were already saving the State a certain amount of money because they were getting a reduced Irish pension as a result of receiving a UK pension. Many of these people feel vulnerable because they live alone in rural areas and are sometimes traumatised by the loss of a loved one. The <Col N="1467" /> review is a bit of a kick in the teeth on the part of the Department at a time of economic buoyancy to these 850 people who end up in a very adverse financial situation. It also indicates a cold hearted attitude on the part of the Department towards recipients of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the matter and decide not to proceed with this review because these people deserve a caring approach. The Department has dealt with the issue in a very insensitive manner. I ask the Minister, whom I believe to be sympathetic to these issues, to again look at the matter. I am sure some of the 850 people involved come from the Minister's County Louth constituency and will be affected by this decision. I look forward to his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue which relates to the means of persons in receipt of widow's or widower's non-contributory pension from my Department who are also in receipt of a social security pension from the UK.</P>
      <P>First, there has been no change in the rules for payment of widow's non-contributory pensions by my Department since I took up office two years ago. The essential feature of all non-contributory social assistance schemes is that any other income which a person has must be taken into account in deciding the rate of pension which they are due. The purpose of this is to ensure generally that people on social assistance means-tested payments are left with the same amount of income, either from their social welfare payment alone, where they have no other means, or from a combination of partial pension and income from other sources. Income from UK pensions is assessable as means for non-contributory pensions and, under the legislation, must be taken into account in the same way as income from any other source.</P>
      <P>Non-contributory pensions are means-tested payments, provision for which is contained in the various social welfare Acts. The legislation contains the rules for the calculation of means, the various disregards of means which are allowed and sets out the amounts of pension payable, having regard to a person's means. Legislation also requires a person to notify the Department in writing if means have increased since the date of making a claim or the date of last investigation of means. Where such notification is received, the amount of pension payment is adjusted as appropriate in accordance with relevant legislative provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the effect of currency fluctuations on the value of UK pensions is also relevant. In calculating means for non-contributory pension purposes, pensions paid in sterling must be converted into Irish punts. As currency exchange rates fluctuate frequently, and in view of the number of Irish non-contributory pen<Col N="1468" /> sioners in receipt of British pensions, it would not be practicable to reassess entitlement each time exchange rates move. Accordingly, when converting currency for means purposes prior to 1 January 1999, the Department used an exchange rate mechanism which was used within the EU for social security transactions between member states. For those countries not participating in the EMU, including the UK, this mechanism continues to be used. The rate represents the average daily exchange rates in the first month of the quarter for use in all transactions during the course of the succeeding quarter. This has been the method used by my Department for many years for converting pensioners' pensions paid in sterling to punts. It has been the practice in my Department to use the rate of exchange which is most beneficial to the pensioner between the rate at the time the review commenced and the rate at the time the decision is made. The rate of exchange in use for the current review is IR£1.12043 to £1 sterling. This figure is considerably less than the true High Street value.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am sure the Deputy is aware that decisions on entitlement to pension or, for that matter, under any other statutory social welfare schemes under social welfare legislation are matters for statutorily appointed deciding officers appointed by the Minister of the day but who are completely independent of the Minister in the exercise of their function. I would like to emphasise that it is not the function of the Minister, nor is it possible for the Minister, therefore, to intervene or to try to influence decisions in individual cases. When determining cases, deciding officers are bound by the legislation governing the scheme in question. Their task is to establish the facts of the case, based on the evidence available, and to then apply the legislation to those facts. A person who is dissatisfied with a decision of a deciding officer may appeal to the equally independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will appreciate that my Department is simply applying the legislation in this area. It is important to bear in mind, however, that we are required to treat all pensioners equitably, whatever their source of income or indeed if they have no income. I am proud of this Government's record in improving the position of all pensioners since we took up office with significant increases in all pension rates of up to 14 per cent. It is my intention that this process will be continued in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for raising this item on the Adjournment is that a number of students who attend third level institutions are, for one reason or another, unsuccessful in their examinations. When these students decide to change course they are refused maintenance grants. I <Col N="1469" /> believe this policy should be rectified. Some young 17 or 18 year old students who make a mistake in their choice of third level course are unable to cope with third level education or with the course they have chosen. Sometimes this is due to a lack of maturity or because they do not get down to study. Having spent a year or two in college, if the student is unsuccessful in his or her examination, he or she may leave college and commence working or drop out of the system altogether. This could happen to someone of 19 or 20 years of age. Having spent two or three years in a third level institution, these students may find that their future in education is totally closed off. I believe the regulations need to be rectified and changed to allow a student, if that student is serious about getting back into education, to be paid a maintenance grant. It is wrong to cut off students at this important and critical time for a young person's future.</P>
      <P>I am certain the Minister is aware that that student can, at a later stage, come back into the system as a mature student and can be paid a maintenance grant. In these instances we should not wait until such students are mature. Why are students or their parents compelled to pay maintenance grants? If they are unable to pay the grant, students may drift out of education.</P>
      <P>While a number of legislative measures in the educational sector have come before the House, this matter has not been addressed. I have consulted the relevant VEC regulations and those of local authorities and the Department of Education and Science, but there is no way such a student can be readmitted to a course other than as a result of serious illness. It is a short-sighted policy which is mean in its approach and represents penny-pinching at its worst. I have come across a number of people in these circumstances and I am sure there are quite a few in every constituency. We have a duty to ensure that students are protected and assisted in every way possible at a critical time for their future lives. Rather than have students drifting and dropping out of education, we should go out of our way to make sure such people get back into the education system.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will examine this matter. It is important that the system is changed. The Minister should let me know whether he agrees to this course of action which would ensure that full-time students who are serious about resuming third level courses are paid maintenance grants. Such grants should not be paid, however, until the student has been confirmed in full attendance at lectures for a period of two months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education and Science who has asked me to deal with this Adjournment matter on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1994 the higher education grant scheme <Col N="1470" /> and vocational education committees' scholarship scheme have included a concession for second chance students returning to college after a break of at least five years having previously pursued, but not completed, a third level course. This concession allows such students to be funded again for periods of study at the same level. Prior to 1994, students did not receive financial assistance until they had completed the equivalent amount of time spent on their original course, irrespective of the length of time which had elapsed between the two periods of college attendance. These arrangements for second chance students are in line with the recommendations in the report of the advisory committee on third level student support.</P>
    <P>The question of what arrangements exist for second chance students in other EU countries was raised recently, and while data is not readily available in this regard, the Minister for Education and Science has asked his officials to review the position of this category of student having regard to the practice in other EU countries. If Deputy Enright has encountered any particular difficulties with the operation of the arrangements for second chance students, I suggest that he forward the relevant details to the Minister's office.</P>
    <P>Apart from these arrangements for second chance students, maintenance grants under the various student support schemes are not provided in respect of attendance on the repeat year of any individual course. This provision can, however, be waived by the grant-awarding authorities in exceptional circumstances, such as certified serious illness.</P>
    <P>I would point out that students may have their grant aid continued for the remainder of the course once they have successfully completed the repeat year. The arrangements are somewhat different under ESF-aided maintenance grant schemes for trainees. This scheme applies to trainees under the middle level technician programme, which consists of one or two year courses up to national certificate level and the higher technical-business skills programme which consists of the three year national diploma and one year add-on diploma level courses. These programmes apply to those who require higher level initial education and training to enhance their employment prospects. In general, this scheme provides for a means-tested maintenance grant for the approved duration of one ESF-aided course only. However, subject to a maximum duration of four years in all &ndash; where trainees have passed, failed or not completed the first year of a course &ndash; they are allowed to transfer to a different course and receive a grant for the normal duration of the new course. Trainees who have completed not more than the first year of a degree level course are eligible to receive maintenance <Col N="1471" /> grants for a maximum of three further years on an ESF-aided MLT-HTBS course.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing the payment of tuition fees and maintenance grants for ESF-aided MLT and HTBS courses form part of the operational programme for human resources and are part of the community support framework 1994-99. Obviously, any relaxation of the current arrangements applying under third level support schemes can only be considered in the light of overall resource constraints and competing demands within the education sector. In this regard the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to the introduction of equitable support for students attending PLC courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science has honoured this commitment with the introduction of maintenance grant schemes for students attending PLC courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year. The grants are means-tested and the rates for grant income limits and other eligibility criteria are similar to those which apply to third level student support schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister's other priority has been to address the position of mature students in general <Col N="1472" /> and independent mature students in particular. Under the student support schemes the rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which he or she is attending. If the address is 15 miles or less from the college, the adjacent rate of grant is payable and if the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the higher non-adjacent rate of grant is payable. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant at an estimated cost of £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>
    <P>I will bring the Deputy's comments to the attention of the Minister and his office.</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental project management group, chaired by my Department was established by Government last year to oversee the implementation of the Government's decision to establish a new commercial entity, in which RTE will be a minority shareholder, which will be responsible for the provision of terrestrial transmission and technical facilities to broadcasters in the future. The project management group is being assisted in this task by a consortium of advisers headed by AIB Corporate Finance. One of the issues on which the project management group requires the assistance of the advisers is the manner in which the transaction to establish the new entity is to be structured. The advisers are currently exploring a range of possibilities in this regard with a view to making a recommendation to the project management group. How fair value is to be attributed to the existing RTE Transmission Network will be considered as an integral part of that process.</P>
      <P>I understand that negotiations are at present ongoing between RTE and representatives of RTE's Network Employees in relation to their proposed transfer to the new DTT transmission entity. As these negotiations are ongoing and are properly a matter between the employees and their employer, I do not believe that it would be helpful for me to comment further at this stage in relation to the question of an employee share option.</P>

      <P>I have not got the information requested by the Deputy as I am not directly responsible for any such schemes. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is responsible for tax incentives under the Finance Acts affecting heritage buildings. This year, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, introduced a grant scheme affecting works to buildings of architectural significance. This scheme is administered through the local authorities. Finally, the Heritage Council has authority to provide financial support for heritage properties. The council administers, such support as an independent statutory authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 16, 33, and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the proposed national historic park on the Great Blasket Island was conditional on the State having ownership of the properties on the island and that this was anticipated by the provisions of An Blascaod Mór National Historic Park Act, 1989. Since that Act's enactment, a number of attempts were made to reach agreement with the representatives of An Blascaod Mór Teoranta with a view to purchasing the holdings held by the company. Unfortunately, it did not prove possible to reach agreement on a purchase price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> The Deputies will be further aware that in July 1999 the Supreme Court upheld a decision of the High Court of February 1998 which declared the 1989 Act to be unconstitutional. The outcome of the Supreme Court decision is that the Act has been struck down in its entirety.</P>
    <P>My Department has, however, continued to actively promote the culture and heritage of An Blascaod Mór, most notably through the exhibition and the programme of activities in the state of the art visitor centre, Ionad an Bhlascaoid Mhóir, which is in place since 1994. A number of the Deputies will have experienced or heard of the highly successful annual Ceiliúradh an Bhlascaoid which is held to celebrate the culture and literature of the islands and which attracts significant numbers each year. Overall visitor numbers to Ionad an Bhlascaoid Mhóir each year now stands at around 40,000 and I am happy that the Ionad is playing a hugely important part in promoting the culture, heritage and educational significance of the island while at the same time contributing to the economic and social development of the wider Corca Dhuibhne area.</P>
    <P>I do take the view that the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930-94 and of the Wildlife Act, 1976, provide the means by which the heritage of the island can be well protected. In this regard, the national monuments Acts were invoked in 1987 to designate the houses of Peig Sayers, Tomás Ó Criomhtain and Muiris Ó Súileabháin as national monuments. I welcome the conservation work which was carried out to the house of Peig Sayers during the past summer by its owner An Blascaod Mór Teoranta, in consultation with my Department, as provided for by the national monuments Acts. I can further inform the Deputies that I am making arrangements to have essential conservation works carried out to the building known as An Dáil which is owned by the State.</P>
    <P>I know that the Deputies will appreciate that the circumstances pertaining today in relation to the Great Blasket Island are greatly different from those in 1989 and that a different response may now be called for. Such response will have to acknowledge and promote the unique cultural, heritage and educational importance of the literary tradition of the Island. I will also continue to acknowledge and promote this tradition by encouraging the maximum possible use of Ionad an Bhlascaoid Mhóir and by utilising the statutory powers assigned to me in relation to the built and natural heritage of the island.</P>
    <P>I propose further to put the matter of future policy in relation to the island formally to the Government, taking account of the Supreme Court decision and other developments since 1989. Following consideration by the Government, I expect to be in a position to make a formal announcement in the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my replies to Questions Nos. 705, 710, 716, 720 and 721 of 29 Meán Fómhair last and to today's Priority Question on this topic.</P>
      <P>As I explained in my earlier reply today, originally, the Inland Waterways Standing Committee of the Heritage Council, met with the<i> Asgard</i> Restoration Project Company (ARP) in late 1996 and indicated its support for the project. However, in December 1998, the Heritage Council's chief executive advised me of the council's intention to form a working group to re-examine the issue, as it is statutorily entitled to do. This working group comprised representatives of the Department of Defence, my own Department, the National Museum of Ireland, the ARP and the Heritage Council with an independent Chairman, Mr. Peter Delamer. I am advised that the Group met on three occasions and made a report to the Heritage Council on its findings. The Heritage Council wrote to me on 30 March 1999 stating that the council having considered the working group's report, now recommended that the ideal solution for the boat was its full conservation, display and interpretation as a land-based exhibit in a suitable location.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views of the Minister for Defence who, I should emphasise, is the actual owner of the <i>Asgard</i>. My role in this matter is strictly to deal with the application for a licence to alter it under the national monuments Acts and the future of the vessel is a matter for the owner when I have arrived at a considered decision in the case.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in my earlier reply today, I will now be considering in detail the application for a licence to alter the<i> Asgard</i> from the ARP in the light of the expert advice, and information available to me and the representations made on this matter, including the views of my Cabinet colleagues, and any other consultation I deem necessary.</P>

However, while the matter is still under active consideration the Deputy will appreciate that there are human resource and financial implications inherent in such a move.</P>
      <P>At present, the premises of the National Museum of Ireland at Kildare Street, Merrion Street and Collins Barracks are open to the public each week between 10.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. from Tuesday to Saturday and between 2.00 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. on Sundays.

      <P>One of the key aims of my Department is the development of the leisure, amenity and tourism potential of inland waterways. The programme of restoration and development of waterways under my control and funded through the EU Operational Programme for Tourism,1994-99 is coming to a close. Under that programme, £19.7 million will have been invested in the waterways is that period with projects ranging from continuing restoration and development of the Royal and Grand Canals and extension of navigation on the Shannon along with the provision of new and enlarged facilities along the river.</P>
      <P>I hope to be able to at least maintain this level of activity in the years ahead. My Department is in the process of preparing a National Heritage Plan which will include the future of the waterways and I hope to publish this plan later next year. In addition, the National Development Plan which will include the financial resources that can be allocated for waterways development over the next seven years is being finalised and I will be in a position to outline the major projects to be undertaken during this period when the plan is agreed and published.</P>

Waterways Ireland will have the functions of management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout this island, principally for recreational purposes. When the body comes into being, I will have discussions with my counterpart in Northern Ireland regarding inland waterways and the programme to be pursued by Waterways Ireland and, of course, these discussions will be continuous in the context of the proposed North-South Ministerial Council.</P>

No restrictions have yet been placed by my Department on farmers in these areas and consequently no losses have arisen and therefore no compensation is currently due.</P>
    <P>Officials of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development have had meetings with farmers representatives on the management prescriptions necessary to ensure the conservation of habitats and species in callows and other habitat types. Prescriptions have already been agreed for the Burren, blanket bogs, heaths, upland grasslands, sand dunes and machair. The discussions relating to callows are nearing completion and, at the behest of the landowners representatives, both Departments have engaged appropriate farming and ecological consultants to prepare pilot farm plans for these areas and to assess any compensation due.</P>
    <P>When those plans are completed and any income losses arising assessed additional consultation with landowner representatives will be arranged.

      <P>Táim ag glacadh leis gur Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge atá i gceist ag an Teachta. D'íoc mo Roinnse £2.074m faoi Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge i 1998. Choinnigh 730 teaghlaigh aitheanta sa Ghaeltacht foghlaimeoirí ar iostas faoin Scéim i 1998 agus meastar go mbeidh thart ar an líon céanna teaghlaigh i gceist i mbliana. Cé go bhfuiltear sásta go ginearálta leis an Scéim, cuirfear go mór le héifeacht na gColáistí nuair a chuirfear moltaí an Ghrúpa a rinne athbhreithniú ar na coinníollacha ginearálta a bhaineann leis na Coláistí Gaeilge Samhraidh i bhfeidhm.

      <P>Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, has set out a programme for transmitting special areas of conservation &ndash; SACs &ndash; required under the EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC, to the EU Commission. This programme will ensure that all terrestrial sites are transmitted to the Commission by the end of this year and that marine sites are transmitted by the end of April 2000.</P>
      <P>The current position is that Dúchas has formally transmitted 145 sites, mainly priority habitat type sites, to the Commission; an additional 52 sites are under appeal and will be formally transmitted as soon as all objections, relating to privately owned lands included in the sites, have completed the appeals process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August last, Dúchas advertised an additional 128 sites and these will be transmitted as soon as <Col N="1484" /> the objections/appeals procedures are completed. I anticipate that the public advertisement of marine sites will occur towards the end of the year. It should be noted that the European Communities (Natural Habitat) Regulations, 1997, provide full protection to these sites once they have been advertised.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a previous question on this matter in February <Col N="1485" /> last, the Taoiseach has already established a national millennium committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, and this committee's function is to advise the Government on appropriate projects and initiatives to celebrate the millennium.</P>
      <P>For my own part I have provided financial support to a project, led by Poetry Ireland, for the publication of an anthology of Irish poetry from the 20th century. I believe that it is an appropriate cultural project to celebrate the literary achievements of the 20th century and will highlight the viality and the continued relevance of Irish poetry as we approach the beginning of a new millennium. I have also launched the &ldquo;Ceoil Reoite: Frozen Music&rdquo; millennium project which involves the commissioning of a number of distinguished Irish musicians to compose a signature tune for a selected list of national monuments and historic properties. This has been a very successful initiative with ten commissions completed to date.</P>
      <P>Background work has now been done in the reports of the interdepartmental working group and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama on the proposed academy for the performing arts. Following on from this, I and my colleague the Minister for Education and Science will bring forward definitive proposals for the establishment of an Irish Academy for the Performing Arts in the millennium year. The creation of this new institution will have the most profound and beneficial effects on the teaching and performance of the performing arts across manny strata of society here.</P>
      <P>I am advised that a number of programmes to mark the millennium are being independently planned by the various cultural institutions which come within the remit of my Department. The National Museum is planning to hold a special exhibition at one of its venues in the year 2000 to celebrate the millennium. The details of this exhibition are still being planned. The National Library plans to mount an exhibition in Dublin, beginning at the end of this year, on the subject of &ldquo;The Turn of the Century and the New Millennium&rdquo;. The National Archives is planning the publication of a CD-ROM and an exhibition based on 1,000 of the most important and visually attractive documents in its collections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant development will be the transfer of the magnificent Chester Beatty Library and Museum of Oriental Art from its present location in Shrewsbury Road to its newly refurbished city centre premises at Dublin Castle. This will enable many items previously unseen to be displayed in an appropriate setting and to be enjoyed by a much wider audience than heretofore. The library is planning in its new home a special exhibition of its most important cultural material which represents many cultures and societies, including very early manuscripts. In addition, the library is in negotiation with museums in preparation for a special millennium exhibition on the origins of <Col N="1486" /> the Gospel and other special events to mark this important year.</P>
    <P>The Irish Museum of Modern Art has just opened an exhibition in Boston of artworks by 13 Irish artists &ndash; Irish Art Now, covering art of the 1990s. This exhibition is planned to tour several other galleries in the US and Canada throughout the year 2000 &ndash; promoting new perceptions of Irish art and artists. A major exhibition &ndash; Fifty Years of Irish Art &ndash; is planned to open in the autumn of 2000, selected by five commentators on art, covering the second half of the 20th century in Irish art decade by decade. The exhibition will put contemporary practice of the 1990s in the context of works of art since the 1950s. Full programmes of seminars, discussions, publications, promotional and marketing campaigns will accompany all the exhibitions and projects and will be distributed nationally and internationally. A new series of displays from the collection is also planned to be shown from spring 2000 onwards and the majority of artworks will be from Irish artists.</P>
    <P>The National Concert Hall &ndash; NCH &ndash; is planning to mark the millennium with a major programme of events featuring outstanding international artists and visiting orchestras throughout the year 2000 season. The NCH will continue its highly successful education and outreach programmes, including the series of &ldquo;In Tune&rdquo; residencies in schools throughout the country which collaborates closely with Irish composers and musicians. A new initiative is being planned to hold a festival of contemporary music which will celebrate the work of Irish composers and a number of new works will be specially commissioned for this festival.</P>
    <P>The National Gallery proposes to mount an exhibition to commemorate George Bernard Shaw to mark his contribution to the work of the National Gallery.</P>

      <P>As Minister with primary responsibility in relation to heritage, I have initiated the preparation of a national heritage plan in line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium. It is intended that the National Heritage Plan will set out strategies for the protection, conservation, management and presentation of the natural heritage, the architectural and archaeological, moveable and immoveable heritage, the inland waterways of the State, and documentary and archival heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> Aspects of the national heritage coming within the scope of the plan will include: (a) natural heritage, including flora and fauna, habitats, geological features and other biodiversity elements, particularly in the context of the proposed National Biodiversity Plan; (b) archaeological heritage, including archaeological sites, monuments, areas, landscapes, artefacts/objects on land and underwater; (c) architectural, artistic and historic heritage (including buildings, structures, parks, gardens and objects of architectural, artistic and historic importance; (d) natural and cultural landscapes; (e) inland waterways; and (f) documentary and archival heritage, including traditional music archives.</P>

This included funding of over £1.7 million towards the improvement of landing facilities on five islands off the County Cork coast and expenditure of almost £0.9 million on the continuation of major marine works at Oileán Thoraí, County Donegal. Further major investment on the offshore islands has been sanctioned to date this year, including works on the pier at Leabh Garbh on Árainn Mhór Island, County Donegal, as well as various smaller infrastructural projects on many offshore islands. As the Deputy knows, I obtained an increase of some 30 per cent in funding for the offshore islands for 1999.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to this House, it is my intention to address the needs of our islands as promised in An Action Programme for the Millennium. In co-operation with the appropriate local authorities', plans are under way to provide improved access facilities for those island communities which do not have adequate access facilities at present. This strategy includes the provision of airstrips on some islands with larger populations. Plans are also being made in conjunction with Mayo County Council for the provision of a cablecar facility between the island of Inishbiggle, County Mayo and the mainland. It is also my intention to continue to fund smaller infrastructural projects on offshore islands.</P>

      <P>There are many definitions of a national park available in an international context including the following concise definition: &ldquo;National Parks exist to conserve natural plant and animal communities and scenic landscapes which are both extensive and of national importance and, under conditions compatible with that purpose, to enable the public to visit and appreciate them.&rdquo;  All of Ireland's national parks comprise lands which have been acquired by the State for the purpose of nature conservation and are established to recognise such State-owned lands as national parks. Successive Governments have accepted the definition of a national park set out by IUCN, the World Conservation Union. The IVth IUCN World Congress on National Parks and Protected Areas defined a protected area as, &ldquo;An area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are six national parks in Ireland, one each in Ulster and Leinster and two each in Munster and Connacht. They contain a significant <Col N="1490" /> representation of the major natural habitats and species of the country and collectively cover an area of some 60,000 hectares or 150,000 acres.

      <P>A new question was asked in the 1996 census of population as to frequency of usage of the Irish language by the population of the country, aged three years and over. In order to establish a trend it will be necessary that a similar question be asked in future censuses. This question has provided very useful information on language usage patterns.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a limit to the amount of information that can be sought in a census and in my view another method, such as a comprehensive linguistic survey, is the appropriate way to obtain more comprehensive information on attitudes and usage.

      <P>I am sorry to see the demolition of the building in question. The building was of architectural significance and I appealed to the developer not to proceed with the works. My role in relation to the protection of the architectural heritage is, primarily, an advisory one. In this instance the developer had, however, validly received planning permission for the works and, unfortunately, chose to exercise this option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the system of protection for such buildings to date has been unsatisfactory and there have been other examples of the erosion of the architectural heritage of the country. Since coming to office the Government has made substantial progress in redressing the situation. Two pieces of legislation were enacted. One places the national inventory <Col N="1491" /> of architectural heritage on a statutory footing. The other, a revision to the Planning Act, introduces more stringent protection to structures of architectural significance. The latter Act comes into effect on 1 January 2000 and it will lead to a much improved situation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has committed resources to my Department to recruit conservation architects and other staff to assist planning authorities in their work and I will be publishing national conservation guidelines for planning authorities in the new year. Further resources are being made available to planning authorities to enable them to recruit conservation officers and to grant aid conservation works.</P>
    <P>These initiatives mark a new beginning in strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage so that instances such as the one referred to by the Deputy are less likely to happen in the future. I would stress, however, that my role will be mainly advisory and that protection in the future will still remain within the planning system.</P>

      <P>My Department, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has agreed a system for preparing commonage framework plans and for training suitably qualified persons to complete these, and plans are under preparation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Departments will shortly approve plans, which will set out appropriate grazing levels for over 40,000 ha. of land. The stocking levels set out in these plans will be put into effect by farmers at the earliest opportunity, taking into account <Col N="1492" /> that individual farmers will have to be informed of the impact of the plans on their farms. In the interim the national framework plan requiring a 30 per cent reduction in commonages will continue to apply. I anticipate that plans will be available for all commonages during 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has introduced cross-compliance in respect of headage and ewe premia in these areas and farmers quota rights will be frozen in accordance with the national framework plan or the individual commonage framework plan, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of this my Department encouraged farmers to commence reductions in 1998 by introducing a once-off payment to farmers who reduced stock levels in winter; this led to a reduction of over 140,000 head in these areas last winter.</P>
    <P>The objective of the commonage framework plans is to ensure that a sustainable level of sheep and lamb production is maintained, in the overgrazed commonages in the future and that damaged vegetation will recover. Compensation through the REPS scheme or an alternative scheme organised by my Department will be paid where farmers have to destock.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department has an ongoing surveying, monitoring, designation and protection programme for the conservation and protection of all wildlife species and in particular, endangered species. It is not possible to detail all the initiatives which have been implemented in the last three years and I propose to confine myself to the principal initiatives put in place during that period.</P>
      <P>On the legislative front, the EU habitats directive was transposed into national legislation through the European Communities ( Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997. Earlier this year I enacted the Flora (Protection) Order, 1999, which significantly increased the range of flora species which receive protection under section 21 of the Wildlife Act. On 29 June this year I was particularly delighted to publish the long awaited Wildlife (Amendment) Bill which will, when enacted, dramatically improve the statutory protection regime in place for the conservation of wildlife and their habitats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further 24 wetland sites were designated under the Ramsar Convention in 1996. Under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, I have formally transmitted 145 candidate SACs to the EU Commission and have <Col N="1493" /> advertised more than 200 other proposed candidate sites. In order to address the overgrazing by sheep, my Department in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development developed a strategy to identify the necessary reductions needed in sheep flocks to eliminate overgrazing. Funding was provided in 1998 which helped facilitate, £6 million was provided by my Department towards funding of a fodder scheme and to introduce a 30 per cent stock reduction in designated degraded counties. I am also introducing systems and procedures for the payment of a fair and proper level of compensation to land owners and users who suffer a financial loss as a result of the designation of their lands.</P>
    <P>On the monitoring side, after significant preparatory work in 1997, my Department in partnership with Birdwatch Ireland, The Heritage Council and with sponsorship from the ESB, the Irish countryside bird survey was launched in 1998. This major survey will provide a comprehensive framework for the ongoing monitoring of Ireland's &ldquo;common&rdquo; breeding birds. It will provide information on changes in populations of a wide range of Ireland's breeding birds from year to year while identifying the factors responsible for such changes and devising appropriate conservation measures. A three year crayfish reintroduction scheme was instituted in County Westmeath in 1998. I am also pleased that I obtained approval from the Minister for Finance for additional manpower resources for Dúchas &ndash; national parks and wildlife, which enabled that division of my Department to discharge its significantly increased functions and responsibilities. In addition to extra administrative and research staff, over 30 conservation rangers are being recruited. Many of these are now in place and are contributing to the enforcement of conservation measures and monitoring of species under the various legislative provisions in place.</P>
    <P>While the initiatives detailed here are not exhaustive, they represent major contributions towards the protection and conservation of all wildlife species and their habitats.</P>

      <P>The site of the crannóg at Ardmore was inspected in 1990 as part of the ongoing archaeological survey of Ireland fieldwork.</P>
      <P>Earliest reported accounts of the crannóg date to the 1870s when it was discovered on peatland under the high water mark. Even then, fears were expressed about the denudation of the monument from the effects of coastal erosion.</P>
      <P>It is thought that the crannóg was originally constructed in a salt marsh but in the intervening years it had become a coastal site from erosion of the sea, and that finally such erosion removed all visible signs of the crannóg.</P>
      <P>It is possible however that remains of the crannóg survive below sub-surface level. The site has accordingly been included in the record of monuments and places for County Waterford under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. This affords the site legal protection in so far as I must be given two months prior notice of any proposal to carry out works on or at the site. I do not have, nor am I aware of, any plans to excavate the site.</P>

      <P>The destruction of any tree is unwelcome from a wildlife perspective but the destruction of trees for unwarranted or spurious reasons certainly cannot be condoned. My Department through Dúchas, its heritage ser<Col N="1495" /> vice, regularly furnishes comments on tree felling licence applications in relation to designated areas &ndash; special areas of conservation, special protection areas and natural heritage areas &ndash; furnished by the Department of Marine and Natural Resources. These designated areas are mainly &ndash; but not exclusively &ndash; located outside urban areas.</P>
      <P>The principal mechanisms for the protection of trees in certain urban areas where felling licences are not required, is through the planning process and the making of tree preservation orders &ndash; TPO &ndash; by local authorities. Any trees which are the subject of a TPO cannot be felled unless the owner obtains planning permission. I understand that the importance of trees and their protection within the planning and development process has been highlighted to the planning authorities on a regular basis by the Department of Environment and Local Government. The recently published Planning and Development Bill 1999, seeks, <i>inter alia</i>, to provide a clearer and more coherent provision regarding tree preservation orders which is to be welcomed. My Department, through Dúchas, will continue to promote the conservation and protection of trees which form important wildlife habitats, contribute significantly to biodiversity and provide, particularly in urban areas, natural features which contribute to our quality of life.</P>

The multilateral system has helped a large number of developing countries to successfully integrate into the international economy and developing countries' share of world export trade has increased by nearly 50 per cent over the past three years.</P>
    <P>The WTO, since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, has brought about major improvements in market access and more predictable rules that have benefited the membership as a whole, in particular smaller countries. Over the period 1995-97, the volume of global trade increased by almost 8 per cent annually, far outpacing the growth in GNP. WTO and OECD studies on the impact of the Uruguay Round have confirmed the positive impact on the world economy as its results are taking effect.</P>
    <P>In addition to a decision to launch a new round of trade negotiations, I would hope that the Seattle ministerial will take decisions that will strengthen the WTO as an institution. These could include improvements to the dispute settlement understanding, the creation of an institutional basis to better address development concerns, the improvement of co-operation between the WTO and other major international institutions and improved procedures to create greater transparency and public awareness of the WTO.</P>

      <P>A tripartite working group, representative of the social partners and Government, has been set up to discuss the measures necessary for the transposition of the EU Directive on Part-Time Work, which must be implemented by 20 January 2000. The working group has reached an advanced stage in its discussions and draft heads of the Bill are currently being prepared by my Department with a view to transposing the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the directive is to prevent part-time workers from being treated less favourably than full-time workers and, in this regard, it aims to provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers and to improve the quality of part-time work generally. The directive <Col N="1497" /> is also intended to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of both employees and employers.</P>

      <P>The employment initiative, of which NOW is a strand, has been operating since 1995 and will continue until end of 1999 early 2000. Over the course of the programme, delays have been experienced in receiving European Social Fund aid which have created difficulties for some project promoters participating in NOW. While projects have been paid their first advance, 50 per cent of their 1999 allocation, further advances have been claimed from the European Commission and are awaited. The next tranche of funding for this initiative is expected in four to six weeks. I would like to assure the Deputy that, once the advances are received in my Department, payments to projects will issue promptly.</P>

    <P>My main concerns regarding any transport of this nature are: to ensure that the vessels concerned do not pass through waters under our jurisdiction &ndash; I have assurances from the UK authorities that they will not; and to ensure that the highest possible levels of safety are applied &ndash; I raised this matter at the IMO assembly in <Col N="1498" /> November 1997 and work on the issue is continuing at that forum.</P>
    <P>My Department has also been discussing the development of improved reporting arrangements for voyages of vessels carrying such materials both within the IMO context and bilaterally with the countries concerned. Regarding the shipments which took place recently, my Department received assurances that the arrangements complied both with the highest international safety levels and with international agreements.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 to 75, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The agreement on agriculture concluded in 1994 as part of the Uruguay Round agreement under the auspices of GATT, now renamed the World Trade Organisation, commits WTO members to resume negotiations for the continuation of the trade liberalisation process in 1999. Ireland will be participating in the negotiations as a member of the EU.</P>
      <P>The EU is currently preparing its negotiating position for the new trade round which will begin with a WTO ministerial conference in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999. The negotiations on agriculture will be based on the 1994 agreement on agriculture, to which the EU is, of course, a signatory, which requires that account be taken of the experience and effects of implementing reduction commitments agreed in 1994, non-trade concerns, special and differential treatment of developing countries and the objective to create a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system.</P>
      <P>In addition, the EU already grants preferential access to its markets for a wide range of agricultural products from developing countries mainly through its generalised scheme of preferences and the Lomé Convention and it has already proposed that WTO Ministers meeting at Seattle enter into a commitment to ensure duty-free market access no later than the end of the new round of negotiations for essentially all products exported by the least developed countries.</P>
      <P>At its September meeting, the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers accepted the need to ensure that the concept of the multifunctional role of agriculture is acknowledged and given due recognition in the WTO negotiations.</P>
      <P>With regard to the need to provide technical support for developing countries, I am aware that FAO is providing such support to assist these countries. In addition, the WTO organised a seminar on trade and development issues earlier this year, while more recently FAO held a similar meeting specifically on agriculture, trade and food security. These efforts are indications of a recognition in the international community of the importance of trade issues to food security, as was also underlined in the conclusions of the world food summit &ndash; WFS &ndash; in 1996. The Government fully shares that perspective and participates actively in the follow-up process to the WFS, which provides a mechanism for international consultation on food security.</P>
      <P>While I would be open to contact from representative organisations in developing countries, consultation with their own Governments, who will participate in the WTO negotiations, would be the most appropriate action in most cases.</P>

    <P>Figures from 1997-98 onwards are provisional and subject to revision.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that in the 1999-2000 tax year, the standard rated personal allowances and PAYE allowance are deducted after tax is calculated rather than before the tax calculation as was previously the case. This should be taken into account in comparing 1999-2000 with earlier years.</P>

      <QRef>[19368/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my speech to the joint annual discussion at the IMF and World Bank annual meeting last week, I stressed that debt relief is a vital element in a more broadly based development strategy aimed at growth and poverty alleviation. An extract of my contribution to the meeting on this subject is attached. The full text of my statement is available under the annual meetings section of the IMF website &ndash; www.imf.org.</P>
      <P>The HIPC initiative, driven by the World Bank and the IMF, is the official response to the need for debt relief, particularly at the multilateral level, but also involving substantial, if not complete relief, in respect of official bilateral debt. The initiative is clearly at a crucial stage in its development both in relation to its general implementation and its financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As originally conceived, the initiative aimed at both (i) freeing the most heavily indebted poorest countries from the burden of the unpayable <Col N="1506" /> element of their debt, and (ii) offering them a definitive exit from the debt treadmill which is seriously undermining their development.</P>
    <P>Following the recent review of the initiative, it has been substantially enhanced &ndash; the amount of debt relief on offer has been doubled, a wider range of countries is to get faster and deeper relief &ndash; and my concern now is that these improvements are fully financed.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that Ireland was to the fore in calling for such improvements, in particular via the submissions made by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs to the review of HIPC, which preceded them.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the wide public concern for a serious attack on the problem of unbearable debt which is reflected in the extent of popular support for Jubilee 2000. This must be addressed and the HIPC initiative must be implemented in a way that achieves its basic aims, as set out above.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the World Bank, the IMF, and individual members and creditors, must remain open to any further enhancements required for effective debt alleviation, in particular taking greater account of human needs in determining eligibility and the extent of the relief required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> Deputies will recall that Ireland is contributing fully to the enhanced initiative. We are also participating in the alleviation of bilateral debt relief in relation to some of our priority aid countries even though our own bilateral assistance has been in the form of grants.</P>
    <P>In my speech to the IMF annual meeting, therefore, I called on governors to resolve any outstanding difficulties in implementing the enhanced HIPC initiative, particularly in regard to its financing. I am glad to say that there appears to have been substantial progress in financing the initiative in the course of the annual meetings. This is an aspect which we will need to keep under close review.</P>
    <P>With regard to the central point of the Deputy's question, I am not convinced that a blanket call for debt cancellation is attainable. Nether is debt cancellation on its own likely to provide a panacea for the economic and development need of HIPC countries. Debt cancellation could send negative as well as positive signals. It does not in itself offer a long-term sustainable solution, in that it could well deny the countries affected access to sources of private capital, which are essential to their economic development. It might also lead to a drying up or reduction of some current bilateral aid which is intended to assist countries in their debt financing. Full cancellation of multilateral debt is not likely to be politically acceptable to the membership of the institutions concerned, who would be required to finance it.</P>
    <P>I fully support the bilateral initiatives by individual countries to relieve bilateral debt in line with the call of the G8 at their Birmingham summit. I would remind the Deputy that, such bilateral relief is also part of the HIPC initiative.</P>
    <P>I see the HIPC initiative as a suitable framework through which viable economic and social reform programmes including debt relief measures can best be achieved. In this regard the Deputy should be aware that Ireland is also pressing the multilateral institutions to ensure that programmes drawn up by HIPC countries take adequate account of the social needs of these countries. We are also supporting increased co-ordination between the various institutions involved and with a wider spectrum of society in the countries concerned to ensure that aid, including debt relief, is used in the most efficient way to promote development and protect the social sector.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Statement by the Hon. Charlie McCreevy, T.D., Governor of the Bank and the Fund for Ireland, at the Joint Annual Discussion</P>
    <P>Extract:</P>
    <P>HIPC Initiative</P>
    <P>Debt relief is a vital element in a more broadly based development strategy aimed at growth and poverty alleviation. The HIPC initiative, driven by the bank and the fund, is clearly at a crucial stage in its development. Although its beginnings <Col N="1508" /> were relatively modest, its ideals, or declared aims, were ambitious.</P>
    <P>It aims at both freeing the most heavily indebted poorest countries from the burden of the unpayable element of their debt, and offering them a definitive exit from the debt treadmill which is seriously undermining their development.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the wide public concern for a serious attack on the problem of unbearable debt which is reflected in the extent of popular support for Jubilee 2000. This must be addressed and the HIPC initiative must be implemented in a way that achieves its basic aims. We must remain open to any further enhancements required for this to be achieved, in particular, taking greater account of human needs in determining eligibility and the extent of the relief required.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, call on governors to resolve any outstanding difficulties in implementing the enhanced HIPC initiative at this stage, particularly in regard to its financing.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, Ireland has adopted legislation enabling it to participate in funding the enhanced initiative to a degree commensurate with its relative standing in the donor community.</P>

      <Quest>the number of staff in the Revenue Commissioners assigned to investigating the 120 Ansbacher account holders; his views on the capacity of this level of staff to fully investigate this number of people; when the investigations will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that some 20 officers are being involved in the investigation at this stage. The preliminary work suggests that the tax liabilities of more than 120 individuals will have to be reviewed. In addition, a substantial number of associated persons, including individuals, companies and discretionary trusts, along with professional advisers and some financiers may have to be investigated. The Revenue investigations will include consideration of prosecutions for Revenue offences where sufficient evidence can be obtained.</P>
      <P>The officers assigned to the work have available to them appropriate back-up from experienced special inquiry branch, capital taxes and anti-avoidance staff. I am advised that Revenue's assignments are adequate to advance the investigation at this stage and that further resources, including legal expertise, will be added as the work develops. It is being treated as a priority call on resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue advise me that an Ansbacher overview team has also been established. This team includes senior officers in charge of investigation <Col N="1509" /> branch, including prosecutions, and the head of the capital taxes division.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to indicate when the investigations will be completed. Obviously, this will depend in each case on the nature of the investigation, the level of co-operation given to the investigators and the decision as to what action is appropriate. The arrangements involved are complex and will require detailed examination. Revenue will be drawing both on the report of the Companies Act authorised officer and on information being obtained using the new powers given to Revenue in the 1999 Finance Act.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, this scheme is operated on a day-to-day basis by the Revenue Commissioners. In addition to the representative from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the group has representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The group, which has met on a number of occasions, will be arranging to meet with representatives of a number of organisations and with a number of persons who have indicated a wish to make oral submissions to it. The information furnished at these listening meetings will facilitate the group in bringing its work to a conclusion and in finalising its report for consideration.</P>

    <P>The scheme is administered by the central repayments office, Monaghan, which is also responsible for the selection of cases for audit. Selections are based on a risk analysis basis and take account of the experience gleaned from the administration of the scheme. Audits are carried out by vehicle registration tax or VRT control officers who are assigned to that work in the various customs and excise collections. The purpose of audit is to ensure that all of the terms and conditions for relief under the regulations are met. Audit is a feature of repayment/relief schemes operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking the claims referred to above were refused because one or more of the fundamental requirements of the scheme were not met. For example; in the case of the disabled passenger scheme, the residency requirement was not met; the vehicle was not used for the transport of the disabled person or the vehicle was leased rather than purchased outright by the applicant. In each case the person concerned was informed of his/her rights of appeal.</P>
    <P>In addition, following audit, five cases were referred to the disabled drivers' medical board of appeal, an independent body, for reassessment, and in each case the primary medical certificate originally issued was cancelled by the board. Claims for repayment of excise duty on fuel used for the transport of disabled persons are made on a four monthly basis and these are subject to separate checks to ensure that the fuel involved was purchased by the applicant and used for the purpose stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I outlined in the Dáil last week, last November I commissioned an independent consultancy to review the foreign adoption assessment procedures in the eight health boards with the aim of ensuring that an efficient and standardised assessment procedure which accords with best practice in the field operates across the country while at the same time having regard to the priority that must be attached to other areas of the child care services. The Government approved the publication of the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Inter-country Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo; in July of this year. The Government also approved the establishment of an implementation group to prioritise, plan and cost the phased implementation of the report's recommendations within a six month period and provided for additional funding of £500,000 in 1999 to enable work to commence on implementation of the report's recommendations. The additional funding has been allocated to health boards on the basis of the waiting list for inter-country adoption assessment in December 1998. Funding provided to the boards has been specifically earmarked for the improvement of the assessment process. The implementation group has been established and has begun its work. The first priority identified by the group is the promulgation of the &ldquo;standardised framework&rdquo; as recommended in the report which will help to achieve a consistent and equitable service countrywide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill to ratify the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption is currently being prepared in my Department. A consultation process was held by my officials in November and early December last with a range of organisations and interest groups. Both the outcome of the consultation and the relevant recommendations of the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework of Inter-country Adoption Assessment&rdquo; have formed part of the deliberations regarding the incorporation of the convention into Irish law. Ratification of the convention will involve major and fundamental amendment of our inter-country adoption laws. At present, our inter-country adoption laws deal mainly with the approval of suitable prospective adopters and the recognition of foreign adoptions. Among the items which the convention Bill will have to make provision for are: the designation of a central authority with overall responsibility for inter-country adoption; the accreditation of competent bodies, for example, adoption agencies to undertake certain tasks in relation to arrangements for the inter-country <Col N="1518" /> adoption of children; and automatic recognition of adoptions made under the convention.</P>
    <P>The approach to adoptions from non-convention countries is still under consideration in the Department. It is not the intention to exclude any countries with which we already have agreements or working arrangements in place which uphold the spirit and principles of the convention. However, the primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or the sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries in order to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned. Therefore, a child-centred approach incorporating structures and procedures which accord with good practice in inter-country adoption is being taken to the preparation of the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, in Ireland mammography is used primarily as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or concerned women on referral from their GPs and in some cases for women at particular risk of developing the disease. There are 19 diagnostic mammographic units available in Ireland for symptomatic breast cancer patients. Of the 19 units, 14 are available outside of Dublin, with at least one unit in each health board area. Breast cancer screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis. The aim is to lead to earlier detection and treatment of breast cancer in asymptomatic women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in March 1997, my predecessor gave the go-ahead for the introduction of phase one of the national breast screening programme for the target population of women aged 50-64, in the Eastern, North-Eastern <Col N="1519" /> and Midland Health Board areas. There will be two central units located at St. Vincent's hospital and the Mater hospital, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach. In addition, the use of mobile units by BreastCheck, the national breast screening board, will ensure that the screening service is accessible to all women in the target age group in these areas. It is expected that the programme will commence in October 1999. My intention is to provide a top quality service which meets best international standards. I am satisfied that the careful planning and deliberation by the national breast screening committee over the past two years in relation to all aspects of the programme will ensure that we can offer a service which is underpinned by standards of excellence and one which will ultimately pay dividends in terms of reductions in mortality among women in the target population.</P>
    <P>A key element in meeting this target date is the provision of appropriate physical facilities. The refurbishment work is in hand and the contractors are currently on site at both the Eccles unit at the Mater Misericordiae hospital and the Merrion unit at St. Vincent's hospital. The planning for the development of the permanent site at the Merrion unit is also ongoing. It is hoped that the necessary works for both units will be completed to facilitate the commencement of the screening programme in October 1999. Another key determinant in meeting the target start up date for the national breast screening programme is the recruitment of the relevant consultant and support staff. The key consultant staff have now been appointed and the recruitment process for support staff is well advanced. The Department is satisfied that all relevant staff will be in place to accommodate an autumn start-up date for the programme.</P>
    <P>My Department is very conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. For this reason, I have requested the national cancer forum to undertake a review of symptomatic breast cancer services at national level prior to the commencement of phase one of the national breast screening programme and to report back to my Department as soon as possible in the matter.</P>
    <P>In tandem with this, my Department recently raised the issue of mammography referral practices with the health boards. The Department's key concern is to ensure that all women, irrespective of age or where they live have timely access to symptomatic services. A critical factor in this regard is referral by GPs to local diagnostic mammography services in the first instance. This should result in a reduction in average waiting times at all mammographic units, thereby improving access for women and at the same time ensur<Col N="1520" /> ing that expertise levels are maintained and developed in diagnostic units around the country.</P>
    <P>The diagnostic mammography units and average waiting times for appointments in each unit are listed on the following table:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the levels of attendance at accident and emergency depart<Col N="1524" /> ments are complex and difficult to predict and in this regard all accident and emergency departments experience periods of exceptional demand which can result in delays for patients. However, it is important to note that appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times and that waiting periods are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I made an additional £2.3 million available for the development of accident and emergency services. This additional funding allowed the Eastern Health Board to run a national public education campaign aimed at persuading people with minor ailments to attend their family doctor rather than a hospital A&amp;E department, and was also used to develop a range of initiatives in major A&amp;E departments. Within this funding, Beaumont Hospital received an allocation of £200,000. The hospital used this funding to provide 24-hour, 7-day-week registrar cover in the department; to introduce a 24-hour triage nursing service, and to appoint a nurse practitioner and improve nurse staffing levels.</P>
      <P>This year I provided further funding of £2 million to enable major acute hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing some of the difficulties being experienced in our accident and emergency departments particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives will include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
      <P>As part of this overall funding, a sum of £200,000 was allocated to Beaumont Hospital for the refurbishment of the treatment areas and overall enhancement of the A&amp;E department to create more comfortable conditions for patients.</P>
      <P>As is clear from the above, the accommodation of patients in the A&amp;E department at Beaumont Hospital is under constant review and continues to be a main priority for the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have also published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and am committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented. The report is one of a number of measures which I have taken to address the question of long waiting lists and waiting times. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999. This is a 66 per cent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997. The report recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inap<Col N="1525" /> propriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>In an effort to address these problems, I have provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used, <i>inter alia</i>, to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards. There are also a number of chronic sick in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months. I am confident that the measures I have outlined will contribute to improvements in availability of beds in the acute sector and ease pressures in accident and emergency departments in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991, and the associated regulations, it is open at any time to an individual local authority to adopt a proposal to alter its boundary for administrative purposes. Before submitting a formal application to the Minister under Part V, the authority must first invite submissions both from the general public and from the other authorities concerned. In certain cases there is provision for the establishment of an independent boundary committee to examine all aspects of the proposal and make recommendations, following which the Minister may make an order altering the boundary. In the case of a county/city boundary such an order would also require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. I have not received any such application in relation to the extension of the Waterford city boundary.</P>

      <P>Signs have been erected at Kells Priory to keep members of the public away from certain areas because of dangerous masonry. The proposed works, which involve conservation of the walls will also have the effect of remedying the dangerous masonry. These works had been scheduled to commence this autumn but have been delayed as a result of difficulties in recruiting skilled staff. My Department is actively pursuing the recruitment of the necessary staff and the conservation work will commence as soon as the necessary recruitment has taken place.</P>

      <P>The pedestrian walk and car park at Brownshill dolmen, County Carlow, have been recently upgraded and a new sign has been ordered. Officials from Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department are in discussion with the local authority about the acquisition of a wider path and a possible information point.

      <P>Donadea Castle is not in State ownership and consequently Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department has no plans for its restoration.</P>
      <P>The castle is a recorded monument, thus affording it protection under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. This requires the owner or occupier to give two months' written notice to my Department of any proposals to carry out works at the site.</P>

      <P>A provision of £1 million has been made in my Department's Estimates for the project, of which 75 per cent is to be funded from the European Union's Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99. To date £91,000 has been expended.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the project is a stand-alone scheme which involves development of the ground floor vaulted areas for exhibition purposes together with access to the first floor and provision of small scale guide and visitor facilities.</P>
      <P>Detailed design for this work is nearing completion. This design is also being informed by the results of the current archaeological excavation programme which commenced on site on 20 September 1999. Advertisements were recently placed in the newspapers seeking suitably qualified building contractors who would be interested in tendering for the work. It is now expected that building work will commence within the next few months and be completed before the end of the year 2000.</P>

      <P>Some years ago my Department, following receipt of requests from the managerial authority and the teachers' union, agreed to pay the school salary on behalf of the school authorities in the case of teachers employed in schools in the free education scheme and to make the appropriate deduction in the capitation grant actually paid to schools. This arrangement was made to facilitate the schools and the teachers concerned. There was no reduction in the capitation grant arising from it.</P>

      <P>I am aware that different funding arrangements are in place for the different school sectors at second level. These arrangements contain provision for secretarial and caretaking services in schools and vocational education commit<Col N="1536" /> tees. Voluntary secondary schools receive additional <i>per capita</i> grants towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services, subject to maximum of £8,750 for caretaking and £10,500 in the case of secretarial services. The manner in which these services are provided is a matter for individual schools. vocational education committees receive allocations for administrative and maintenance staff to be allocated as each committee sees fit. All community and comprehensive schools have at least one caretaker and secretary with increased provision for the larger schools. The cost of secretarial and caretaking staff allocations for vocational education committees and community and comprehensive schools is met centrally by my Department.</P>
      <P>The matter of equity in second level funding has been examined by a steering group, which included representatives from all the education partners.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The annual higher education grants scheme, which I approve, sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes <Col N="1537" /> of the scheme. An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
    <P>The approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly funded third level institutions. However, there are a number of religious and other institutions that have been admitted to the scheme over the years.</P>
    <P>Any extension of the existing arrangements in relation to the scope of the scheme to include courses in colleges such as Griffith College or the Leinster School of Business must be considered in light of overall resource constraints and the competing demands within the education sector. My priorities in the area of student support have been to introduce a maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses from the 1998-99 academic year and to address the position of mature students under the various grant schemes from the current academic year. I would also remind the Deputy that this Government has funded a major increase in the number of places in public colleges.</P>
    <P>Tax relief is available for tuition fees paid by students who are attending private third level colleges. Such students or their parents, as appropriate, can avail of tax relief, at the standard rate, on tuition fees paid in respect of full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in such colleges, provided that both the college and the course satisfy the prescribed codes of standards and are approved by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the question of any college assuring students of their entitlement to grants, I have asked my officials to contact both of the colleges referred to in the question to ensure that such assurances are not given in the future.</P>

      <P>The Government, in June 1997, decided to appoint a body under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, to advise the Higher Education Authority on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university under sections 12 and 13, the Dublin Institute of Technology should be established as a university.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group, chaired by Dr. Dermot Nally, was published in November 1998. The review group recommended that, while there should not be immediate university status for the Dublin Institute of Technology, it might become a university within a three to five year period subject to it meeting a number of criteria set out in its report. Following detailed consideration and analysis of the advice prepared by the review group the Higher Education Authority published its recommendations in March 1999.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority recommended against the immediate establishment of Dublin Institute of Technology as a university and indicated that a further statutory review of the institute in line with section 9 of the Universities Act would be necessary for the Dublin Institute of Technology to be established as a university.</P>
