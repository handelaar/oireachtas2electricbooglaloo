      <P>It is proposed to take No. 4, Finance Bill, 1999 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 24, Statements on Agenda 2000. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m; (2) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 24; (i) the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes. Private Members' Business shall be No. 68, Motion re. Confidence in the Minister for Health and Children (resumed).</P>

      <P>Before we agree to the late sitting, will the Taoiseach clarify an event that has taken place since yesterday's Question Time? I tabled questions to the Taoiseach yesterday which were ruled out of order. However, the Taoiseach indicated in his reply that he had no access to papers in the Department of Finance regarding the contract with GTech or, alternatively, section 19 of the Finance Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>It has subsequently emerged that a senior official in the personal office of the Department of the Taoiseach arranged private briefings for selected journalists on a one by one basis. I regard that as an act of contempt for this House. There is no difficulty in relation to access to the information for journalists but there is clearly a difficulty in providing access to information for Deputies. Will the Taoiseach clarify the point before we proceed further this morning?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be useful for me to make a few points. There has been some confusion because some of this morning's newspapers said I ruled out the questions yesterday and refused to answer them. You, a Cheann Comhairle, made quite clear yesterday that it was your office which ruled them out. I did not refuse to answer anything yesterday.</P>
      <P>Very serious allegations very made in a number of Sunday newspapers that directly concern me. They were not made by politicians in this House but by newspapers. At 11.48 a.m. last Saturday I was given 13 questions by Mr. Matt Cooper of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>. I was asked to give replies to those in the early afternoon so that he could check them with his legal people and have them printed in the late afternoon for the Saturday night edition. Through my office, I said that was absolutely impossible but that as soon as we could get the records we would make them available.</P>
      <P>There were no records relating to GTech or section 19 of the Finance Bill, 1994, in my office or in my possession. I do not keep records relating to any Finance Bill in which I was involved or any briefing note, although I did recognise the briefing note in the newspapers last week as one that I would have had as Minister for Finance, because it was clear from the language that it was a Revenue briefing note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> I asked my office yesterday to ask the officials in the Department of Finance, who had these records, to brief the newspapers on these matters. They can also brief any committee of this House. It is a pity they cannot brief the entire House because then people would be able to see the position. Unfortunately, what happens in these cases is when a totally erroneous, false and damaging allegation is made it is on the front pages of the Sunday newspapers, but when it is clarified that I was involved in no wrongdoing, that is put on page 19. That is the difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what the Taoiseach said. Will he not agree that it would have been far more appropriate for the offer made by the senior official in the personal office in the Department of the Taoiseach to have been extended to Opposition Members who were simply doing our job yesterday? The Taoiseach has misled the House by saying he had no access&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider it might be better, in matters of this nature, if he were to make a statement himself rather than having third parties do it for him? There seems to be a pattern which probably is not helpful. Given that the allegations were about the Taoiseach, he should have made the statement himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no difficulty doing that in normal events. However, as Deputy Bruton, who has been in this position, knows, if one were to do that one would have to make many statements to the House. A part of political life in this country today is the theory of the former US President Johnson  &ndash;&ldquo;Hear the Taoiseach of the day deny them&rdquo;. That is what the game really is. Nobody believes us.</P>

      <P>In regard to promised legislation to amend the Central Bank legislation, will the Taoiseach consider strengthening the bank's powers to assist them to deal with suggestions that there may be collusion among banks across Europe to keep charges up on euro transactions? Does the Taoiseach agree this would damage Ireland more than any other country because we have a land boundary with a non-euro state and are therefore more vulnerable to any collusion on transactions involving euro conversions? Will the Taoiseach consider raising this matter in his discussions with the Dutch Prime Minister later today in the hope that the matter might be raised at the summit? </P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach inadvertently misled the House. I asked him if the Government intended to introduce legislation to give effect to the European Convention on Human Rights. He referred to a piece of legislation, the draft heads of which have been circulated and do not contain any proposal in respect of the European Convention on Human Rights. Is further legislation envisaged or will the draft heads be amended to incorporate what was already set out in the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that the Government has authorised a series of very complex changes on pensions for self-employed persons and an even more complex set of arrangements on the manner in which the bank accounts of non-residents will be dealt with in the future. None of these proposals is incorporated in the Finance Bill. It is not possible for the Opposition or any Member of this House to deal with these complex proposals sight unseen. Will the Taoiseach guarantee that Members will receive these proposals well in advance of Committee Stage of the Finance Bill? Otherwise, we will not be able to do our parliamentary duty. It is simply not possible to have an informed debate on these issues unless we receive outside briefing. If that does not happen, the House is no more than a charade and the debate on the Finance Bill simply becomes an exercise in futility.</P>

      <P>The increase from £50,000 to £100,000 in the maximum amount of company <Col N="1006" /> profits qualifying for the 25 per cent reduced rate of corporation tax is welcome. Having the rate of corporation tax at roughly half of the top marginal personal tax rate encourages the investment of profits in businesses. Historically small Irish businesses have been undercapitalised. This encouragement for reinvestment improves the capitalisation of companies and helps them to become stronger and better able to compete in the international framework in which they operate. The corporation tax take in recent years has been much improved due to the reduction in its rate. It is also welcome that the rate of corporation tax is to be reduced to 12.5 per cent on a phased basis by 2003.</P>
      <P>The need for Luas and an improved public transport system is underlined by the report of a 20 per cent increase in car sales in January 1999. Tax relief for the provision of park and ride facilities and certain related developments is welcome. The limit of 50 per cent in respect of expenditure on commercial and residential developments associated with the park and ride development should be examined. A park and ride facility does not appear to be as capital intensive as the development of commercial or residential property. Perhaps the park and ride complex would be better balanced and made more economically viable by the allowance of a higher concentration of commercial and residential development. I accept that parking for users of commercial developments and residences may limit the spaces available for the users of park and ride facilities and that a balance must be struck. I accept what the Minister said yesterday, that he does not want to introduce too many reliefs or allowances of this nature, as they are contrary to the ethos of our taxation system.</P>
      <P>I welcome the save as you earn share scheme which provides for employees to save for a certain period to acquire shares in their company at a discount on the market price at the start of the savings period. I also welcome that no tax will be applied until those shares are subsequently sold. The terms of the save as you earn scheme were decided after consultation with IBEC and ICTU. This shows the value of social partnership in the continuing improvement of our economy and long may it continue.</P>
      <P>Section 44 provides for granting section 23 relief for rented residential accommodation for third level students. This is subject to the guidelines of a number of Departments. I wholeheartedly support this development as a result of the measures adopted after the publication of the Bacon report, particularly in light of the scarcity of economically priced rental accommodation This is an example of the flexibility and ingenuity of the Minister in tackling, in a focused manner, a problem which arose only recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 41 provides for a number of changes in the rural renewal scheme. Dublin is bursting at its seams and the demand for housing and accommodation is ever increasing. Granting relief for expenditure in towns within commuting distance <Col N="1007" /> of Dublin would help first time buyers to purchase a home and take pressure off house prices in Dublin by reducing the demand for them.</P>
    <P>Section 28 is a welcome novel one. It exempts from income tax the benefit-in-kind arising from the provision of an annual or monthly train pass. I hope this will help encourage commuters to transfer from private to public transport.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides that child care services will not be taxed as benefit-in-kind, if provided by the employer. Many studies and reports have been undertaken in this area in recent years and it is obvious that a substantial change is needed in the attitudes towards and responsibility for the provision of child care. This must be viewed as a societal rather than an individual problem. Responsibility for child care rests on all of us.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent section 25 takes God out of taxation legislation as it will be possible for persons to affirm as an alternative to taking an oath. On reviewing the Constitution the Progressive Democrats Party suggested that reference to God should be removed from it. Is this the Progressive Democrats' contribution to the Finance Bill? I say this tongue in cheek as I acknowledge that the policies of the Progressive Democrats in relation to taxation have had an obvious input into the first two of the Government's five budgets, and I expect this will continue.</P>
    <P>Regarding income tax, the increase in exemption limit to £6,500 for a single person and £13,000 for a married couple for persons over 65 years of age is very welcome. As the Minister stated, this will take 15,000 elderly people out of the tax net.</P>
    <P>I am also very much heartened and delighted that the tax credit system is being introduced in terms of personal allowances. This, of course, will mean in future that if personal allowances are increased, those on lower incomes will benefit to the same extent as those on higher incomes.</P>
    <P>I am delighted and encouraged that the allowance of £8,500 for a family to employ a carer can now be apportioned between the people who contribute to that cost. This was a bone of contention in many families for a long time and this provision is very worthwhile and welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Finance Bill I recognise it gives effect to the budget which was typically Fianna Fáil in nature in so far as there was something in it for everybody. I particularly welcome the fact that those on lower incomes get particular recognition in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to focus on two elements of the Bill, namely, those which deal with the young in terms of child care and students and those which deal with the elderly. There are two sections dealing with child care. Section 43 allows for capital allowances where construction, extension, refurbishment or conversion is necessary in child care premises which need to be brought into line with the changes brought about in the Child Care Act, <Col N="1008" /> 1991, and the amending legislation of 1996. This provision is very welcome as it means the cost can be offset over seven years. However, I regret it is not enough. The second relevant section is section 29 whereby services provided by employers or a group of employers for their employees, be they free or subsidised, cannot be charged to income tax as a benefit in kind. Again I welcome the provision but it is not enough.</P>
    <P>It is only now that we are beginning to realise the extent of the crisis in child care. I speak in particular with reference to my constituency of Dun Laoghaire where parents are being put to the pin of their collar to pay child care costs, where there have been cost increases of over 20 per cent in the past couple of months and where parents have been asked to pay an extra £126 per month to have their child looked after while at the same time we are encouraging parents, in particular young women, into the workforce.</P>
    <P>Without hesitation I say that if parents were farmers and children were fodder, the crisis would have been recognised long ago and grants would have been given. Unfortunately, we do not recognise the crisis which is affecting parents. In examining in particular the provisions in relation to benefit in kind, I ask whether we want to encourage parents to bring their children in a car through rush hour traffic to their place of work and deposit them there in a child care facility? Naturally, we would encourage employers to provide services for their employees, but surely the best place for a child whose parents opt to have him or her in full day care is in their local residential community. I ask that the Minister extend the facility in section 29 to community based projects so that if local employers and shopkeepers want to invest in a facility for the good of a community such projects could be treated favourably in the tax code.</P>
    <P>The Southside Partnership, based in Dun Laoghaire, has come up with a very imaginative proposal for the former cottage home in Dun Laoghaire and they are inviting investment from local employers. Those employers must be encouraged to provide child care facilities for the community. They might then be able to help the distraught mother living in Ballybrack who rang me yesterday and told me she was paying £70 per week for child care but now, following an immediate increase, is paying £90 per week. She earns £90 per week and cannot afford child care any more. There is no place for her to put her child. It is a crisis and I ask the Minister to see if there are ways we can extend schemes and give grants to facilitate parents who are really being put to the pin of their collar.</P>
    <P>The national child care strategy, which was launched last week, must be considered in conjunction with the recommendations of the Commission on the Family and the reports on pre-school and early school education to ensure long-term facilities are made available and recognition is given to all parents irrespective of where they <Col N="1009" /> work. Perhaps in the interim something could be done to solve the immediate crisis.</P>
    <P>Another element relating to young people which I welcome is section 31 which gives tax relief for gifts of money made to the scientific and technological education investment fund. One of the most far-reaching decisions on technology and technological education in recent years was the establishment of this fund. Every encouragement must be given to investors to match the money invested by the Department.</P>
    <P>Another issue relating to young people, which is a problem, is that young students, particularly those coming to Dublin city, are unable to find accommodation at reasonable rates. Section 44 provides 100 per cent tax relief for rental residential accommodation in respect of the provision of third level student accommodation. This is a great encouragement to third level institutions, many of which have very valuable land, to provide more facilities for students, thereby easing the burden in the long-term for students coming to Dublin seeking accommodation.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provisions relating to the elderly. The fact that 15,000 people over the age of 65 years will no longer be in the tax bracket is something we all welcome. The increase in the tax exemption level to £6,500 for persons aged over 65 years will be welcomed by many elderly people in my constituency. Equally, the announcements made about pensions will be welcomed. The new provisions ensure an increase in the amount which can be claimed as a deduction for the funding of retirement provision. The fact that people will not be restricted to one pension, people can retain ownership of the capital sum and pensioners can have a greater role in the investment of accumulated funds will encourage people to plan for their future. It will allow people more flexibility and control. Surely, the next logical step is a State funded pension scheme. The scheme which currently exists is all right as long as the number of elderly is fewer than the number of people working. The profile of our population is changing in such a way that perhaps we should be moving towards a proper, State funded pension scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome two other elements in relation to the elderly, the first being the extension of the existing tax allowance for employers of carers. Carers have not been recognised over many years and the new elements in the Finance Bill at least give recognition to this group of people who are so dedicated that they sacrifice their own lives for the good of others.</P>
    <P>On section 42 on private convalescent facilities and the capital allowance for expenditure on that there is a grave need for convalescent facilities to free up acute hospital beds. The idea is that convalescent care would be an alternative to hospital care for patients recovering from acute hospital treatment. There are a number of large houses in my area which are very appropriate for this type of work. I worry about whether these facilities, which have to date served as retirement <Col N="1010" /> homes, will be converted fully into convalescent facilities. It is becoming a problem that people cannot find places in retirement homes. I hope the Minister will continue to give tax and capital allowances to places which want to convert into full time retirement homes as well, because it will be a problem for us in the future.</P>

    <P>In welcoming the provisions, I recognise that much needs to be done and I particularly ask the Minister to address the crisis in child care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main features of this Finance Bill is the Minister's decision to give unprecedented powers to the Revenue Commissioners, as contained in sections 189 and 190 and outlined by the Minister in the House last evening. No doubt these powers will be welcomed by the compliant taxpayer who has been increasingly disillusioned by the level of fairness in our taxation system. I have not experienced such a level of disgust among individuals who have always paid their lawful tax to the State. This has no doubt been fuelled by the scandals emerging from the tribunals and tax scandals such as Ansbacher and National Irish Bank. These have exposed the inadequacy of existing tax legislation and lack of enforcement. It also begs the question as to whether the powers in this Bill are misdirected and whether the banks, as much as the individual wrongdoer, should be the target, which Deputy Noonan argued strongly yesterday evening.</P>
      <P>The level of tax evasion in recent years was actively encouraged by the two tax amnesties introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1988 and 1993, which were described by some commentators at the time as a charter for cheats. These amnesties rewarded the tax evader and the wrongdoer. The measures in this Bill will provide the powers to the Revenue Commissioners, if suspicious of tax evasion, to investigate the relevant accounts without having to establish a<i> prima facie</i> case before the courts. There will be general public support for these new measures to investigate non-resident accounts, especially when our largest bank, AIB, held 53,000 non-resident accounts. It would appear NIB actively promoted off shore bonds for tax avoidance purposes. I hope the new powers in the Bill will have the effect of restoring public confidence in our tax laws. However, at the end of the day, people will only have confidence in the fairness of our tax system if these laws are vigorously enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the Revenue Commissioners having very strong powers already at their disposal, only one custodial two year suspended sentence has been imposed for tax evasion. The compliant tax<Col N="1011" /> payer will have to see some high profile convictions of tax evaders to convince them that this Government, the Revenue Commissioners and this House are serious about the implementation of a fair and equitable tax system.</P>
    <P>The proposed new powers are causing concern in some quarters. The Institute of Taxation of Ireland, for example, which represents many tax practitioners, expressed serious reservations about the new powers and called for a new tax ombudsman to oversee them. The institute claims the new powers are so extensive that there may no longer be sufficient checks and balances in the system to protect the rights of innocent taxpayers. The former president of the Institute of Taxation, Brian Bohan, a solicitor, was quoted in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> as saying that there are major question marks over this legislation on a number of grounds, including constitutionality, fair procedures and balance and that this is a knee-jerk reaction to an unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>The new powers have also come in for criticism from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. Siobhan Ní Chúlacháin of the council commenting on the new measures said these are very wideranging, broader than the powers the Garda have if they suspect someone of committing a crime, and that opportunities for abuse are bound to arise and without the safeguard of the courts some system of checks and balances must be put in place.</P>
    <P>No doubt the sections dealing with the new powers will be revisited on Committee and Report Stages. A number of balancing amendments, if necessary, will be put forward by the Opposition spokesperson and maybe the Minister. Overall my party supports the new provisions. However, I agree with Deputy Noonan that we need a White Paper on taxation to be published in 1999 which would clarify the many consequences for the taxpayer of the provisions in this Bill and many of the grey areas which have been introduced because of the complex nature of and the new provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on tax reliefs in this budget. I welcome the improvement in the Bill for the PAYE sector, in particular concessions for lower income earners and those over 65 years. Because of the changes, as pointed out by the Minister, low income earners on less than £100 per week will not have to pay tax, which is very welcome. However, we have a long way to go before we arrive at the level of our nearest neighbours in England where one can earn up to £180 without being taxed.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of competitiveness, it is very important that we increase the band and take as many low income earners as possible from the tax system. Many small companies, especially in rural Ireland, are really stretched to survive and compete and are not in a position to give their employees extra wages apart from the requirements under Partnership 2000. The only way these people can be rewarded is through the taxation system. The Minister should continue <Col N="1012" /> this policy which was that of the Rainbow Coalition going into the last election. We wanted to target tax benefits at the lower paid and to increase the tax bands and personal allowances. This is certainly a return to that policy and a departure from the policy of reducing the tax rates which the Minister pursued in last year's budget. From the point of view of rural Ireland and small businesses throughout the length and breadth of this country, it is the only way they can survive and remain competitive. I certainly welcome that departure in the budget.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects in the Finance Bill I would like to address. One is the widespread concern in the film industry about the future of section 481 on tax reliefs for investment in film production and the other is the issue of vehicle registration tax. I will refer to the film industry first. Despite the Minister's assurances, there is widespread concern about the future of section 481 tax relief for investment in film production which is being extended for a further 12 months pending full consideration of special studies to be published by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This has led to widespread uncertainty at all levels of the industry.</P>
    <P>Section 481, previously section 35, has been an invaluable instrument in the growth of the film industry, especially the indigenous production sector. It allows producers to approach the international market with a proportion of their budget in place, a key element in triggering foreign investment in the form of pre-sales and co-production finance. It is treated as their equity, allowing ownership of the film, thereby providing potential for future revenue from foreign sales.</P>
    <P>As the incentive can only be used by producers who have raised a significant proportion of their budget in the form of international pre-sales, the focus is on developing and maintaining a strong orientation towards the international market. This has created an outward looking and internationally aware independent production sector with a high product standard and helped to create strong links and co-operation between the film production sector and financial sector and generated expertise in the area of international film finance.</P>
    <P>The quality of training is of a high standard. Technicians, actors and other participants secure more challenging and better quality work in locally produced films. Much of the writing, directing and acting talent nurtured in recent years has achieved a level of international confidence with international financers, which in turn assists the financing of more ambitious projects. The Minister's announcement has created major shock waves in the industry. He should table an amendment on Committee Stage guaranteeing the continuation of section 481 for a further five years.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael supports the renewal and enhancement of section 481 for a number of reasons. Enhancement of the existing incentives would enable indigenous production companies to <Col N="1013" /> develop business plans in the medium and long-term. Output would be increased and mechanisms organised to encourage proper and systematic project development as well as strategies to retain programme and film rights. Improvements would encourage film related services, including the development of studio facilities, and post-production companies to plan for growth and investment. Allowing tax relief of up to 100 per cent on expenditure would encourage the emergence of additional studio, sound post-production and laboratory facilities with additional employment and economic activity.</P>
    <P>Providing stability for the industry would build on progress made in recent years in the crucial area of talent development &ndash; directors, writers, producers, actors and technicians who have made their mark on the international scene. It would encourage them to remain here. Irish producers have encouraged and fostered the growth of this talent.</P>
    <P>Given the sensitivity of the industry to exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly attractive incentives available in other countries, improvements would give Ireland a competitive edge. The British have not only copied the incentives provided here but improved on them. Because of the post-production facilities available, Britain is becoming an attractive location for film makers. Irish producers should be enabled to go to the market with well structured commercial ideas to put them in a better position to hold on to film rights.</P>
    <P>Film Makers Ireland, the representative organisation for feature film producers, is deeply concerned that section 481 is only to be extended for a further year. It is producing a special report which will indicate clearly the benefits of film making and the effects of the industry on employment creation. I do not want to pre-empt its findings but it will make a strong case for the continuation of section 481.</P>
    <P>The short-term measure proposed does not provide an appropriate framework for the film and television industry to continue its phenomenal progress. This contradicts directly Fianna Fáil's long-term strategic policy on the industry as outlined in its policy document of December 1996 prior to entering Government. It promised enhancements to section 481 which have not materialised.</P>
    <P>The economic and employment benefits speak for themselves. Figures indicate that returns to the Exchequer from activity driven by section 481 have increased each year since 1993. There has been a substantial net benefit. In 1997 IBEC estimated net returns at £14.5 million. Total employment, direct and indirect, has risen from 1,200 in 1993 to over 4,000 last year. Ireland has a first-class reputation with the international film and television community and is a premium location for production.</P>
    <P>I am aware from my contacts in America that there is concern and that a number of projects have been put on hold. In Los Angeles, where <Col N="1014" /> the screen commission is to be launched later this month, the Minister will meet people who are confused. The timing of this decision could not be worse. A significant number of jobs may be at risk unless a more strategic and long-term approach to supporting the industry is adopted by the Government.</P>
    <P>James Flynn, co-producer of &ldquo;Angela's Ashes&rdquo;, commented, &ldquo;It is ironic that the week that Steven Spielberg's &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo; has received Oscar nominations we may now have a period of uncertainty in Ireland which will be immediately highlighted by our many overseas competitors&rdquo;. In a recent article in one of the Sunday newspapers Louise Casey of the Galway company, Magma films, was quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>We have a £5.6 million drama series with a German broadcaster hanging in the balance. The single, overwhelming reason they agreed to the project was section 481.</P>
    <P>She said that up to 200 potential jobs could be lost over the next two to three years if section 481 is not extended beyond April 2000. In warning that the dropping of the section is likely to be exploited by Ireland's international competitors, James Flynn was quoted in the same article as saying:</P>
    <P>Ireland already ranks very low down the incentives tables, and incoming producers are very sensitive to the market. This has made the job of the Screen Commission, which is to have its international launch in Los Angeles later this month, very difficult. Film production, by its nature, is a long-term project, but we can only give short-term guarantees.</P>
    <P>The message should be conveyed strongly to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands as well as the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach that section 481 should be amended immediately. My party's spokesperson on the arts, heritage, Gaeltacht and the islands, Deputy Kenny, and I will table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I now come to the most extraordinary part of the budget. I cannot understand why the Government decided to attack, not the motor industry, but motorists. Motorists are already burdened by the worst roads in Europe, in rural Ireland, and by gridlock and traffic congestion in cities. They were targeted in the budget and there is nothing in the Finance Bill to rectify those injustices. The increase in VRT provided for in the Finance Bill cannot be easily justified. It is not an environmental tax or a tax on the motor industry, it is another tax on motorists.</P>
    <P>Car ownership levels will continue to rise as we become a more affluent and modern society. Even though we experienced substantial increases in sales of new cars in the past few years we are still catching up on our European neighbours. There are 30 cars per 100 people in Ireland, compared to 36 per 100 in Northern Ireland and 50 per 100 in Germany. The recent <Col N="1015" /> increase in VRT was hailed as an environmental tax, but this is not accurate as it will encourage drivers to retain older cars rather than upgrade to new vehicles.</P>
    <P>The motor industry has gone to great lengths to reduce air pollution, to improve fuel consumption and so on. It takes 30 new cars to create the same level of emissions as one car made five years ago. Almost 85 per cent of a new car is recyclable and the most fuel efficient new cars are in the 1.6 litre to 2 litre category, the segment targeted for the VRT increase. VRT and VAT make up a staggering 61 per cent of the pre-tax price of a standard family car, yet our pre-tax price is in line with the European average. A retail price of 25 per cent more than other EU countries is unjustifiable and highlights that the VRT increase penalises the motoring public. The increase across the 1.6 litre range will have a negative impact on PAYE family car owners, who are traditionally in this range, fleet and SME owners and, particularly, the rural farming population who rely on small diesel engines. Sixty four per cent of car sales outside Dublin are diesel sales in the 1.6 litre and 2 litre range.</P>
    <P>The number of cars in Ireland will continue to increase. The buoyant economy, resulting in an increase in the numbers at work, and the welcome return of our well-educated young people who had to emigrate to secure employment, will guarantee this trend continues. Increased car ownership is a reality. VRT increases will not dampen new car sales but will leave the negative effect of leaving older cars on roads for longer periods. At a time when the EU is introducing directives to encourage the removal of old cars to improve the environment, it makes no sense to increase VRT as this will have the opposite effect. My proposal is for a modest increase in the 22.5 per cent VRT band from 1.4 litre to 2 litre engines. This would help the environment, alleviate the tax burden and reduce the cost of motoring for ordinary motorists, PAYE workers and fleet drivers in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The VRT provisions in this Bill are unnecessary as Government revenues from this source would have increased anyway due to economic buoyancy. The Minister pointed out that VRT increases are not adversely affecting new car sales but that is not the issue. The issue is the treatment of consumers who are being cheated out of the benefits of the single European market and are paying more for cars than is reasonable, a price which is well above the European average. This is a result of the level of VRT.</P>
    <P>The increases were introduced under an environmental pretext, but this is an anti-environmental measure. To take steps which discourage the replacement of older vehicles with newer, more environmentally-friendly ones, flies in the face of environmental good sense and is contrary to environmental aspirations at EU level to reduce CO2 emissions by encouraging the replacement of older vehicles. It is clear the VRT <Col N="1016" /> increase was nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to concerns about traffic congestion in major urban areas. I have no doubt it was also influenced by the environmental report presented to the Minister and the Government before the budget. It is obvious they took more notice of that report than of representations by the motor lobby or from Members who expressed concerns about VRT.</P>
    <P>Increases in VRT will contribute nothing other than ensure vehicles stuck in traffic will be older and more polluting, the opposite to what is intended. Vehicle numbers will continue to increase even if new car registrations were halted by used imports and the retention of older vehicles. Our buoyant economy will result in more people wishing to own cars. There will be higher car ownership, irrespective of VRT.</P>
    <P>The problems of congestion in major urban areas can be attributed to the lack of progress in, and a commitment to, public transport and the road infrastructure rather than to the number of cars. If the VRT proposals are a reaction to traffic problems then rural Ireland is being asked to pay the largest proportion of the increases. Diesel engines, which produce lower CO2  emissions than equivalent petrol engines, are a necessary choice for most people in rural Ireland. They are the work horses of rural Ireland. Sixty four per cent of 1.4 litre and 2 litre cars outside Dublin are diesel engines. If one were to remove registrations from other major urban areas, the diesel percentage in rural Ireland would be even higher.</P>
    <P>In my contribution to the budget debate, I stated that this measure was more of an attack and a tax on those in rural Ireland than on those in urban areas. The 1.7 litre and 1.9 litre diesel engines are the smallest available, so many in rural Ireland have no choice but to purchase a vehicle targeted for this increase in VRT.</P>
    <P>We have created an environmental dustbin in which older vehicles are welcomed but none are allowed leave. This means we are responsible for disposing of more older vehicles than should be case because of the number of second-hand cars coming into the country. The environmental and financial costs associated with the disposal of end-of-life vehicles are a major concern for all developed European economies and will be of increasing concern for Ireland in the future. The Minister should introduce an amendment to allow for the refund of a percentage of VRT relative to the value of the vehicle at the time of its export. This provision would give an incentive to many dealers and individuals to export cars. Ireland is not competitive in this area. Prices are too high to allow an export trade in secondhand cars.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment I intend to introduce will be to broaden the low VRT band of 22.5 per cent to cover vehicles up to two litres. I appeal to backbenchers on the Government side, many of whom have privately expressed their support for this measure to the motor industry, to support the amendment and to convince <Col N="1017" /> the Minister that there would be no loss of revenue if the provision was introduced. If such a measure was implemented from 1 April, given the buoyant level of car sales so far this year, Government revenue would still be on target for an additional £42 million from vehicle registration tax. There would not be a budget shortfall as a result. I intend to speak to Deputy Lenihan and others who made this a major issue during their contributions on the budget debate and subsequently. They must talk to their Minister and ensure that my simple and reasonable amendment is accepted.</P>
    <P>It has reached the stage where a charter of rights for motorists is required. They are subject to the worst roads in Europe, traffic congestion and gridlock. They also pay the highest amount of tax. There has been progress on PAYE. It is now time that motorists got a break. I intend to pursue the cause of motorists on Committee and Report Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, on his excellent contribution to the debate. As a backbencher, I take note of his comments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill. It is one of the largest Finance Bills ever published and contains a series of important initiatives to reform the tax system in favour of the lower paid, which I welcome. The Bill will cut personal taxation rates for all taxpayers, introduce significant new tax reliefs and set a new agenda for tax relief and pension provisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, indicated that he is making radical change when such change is desirable. He pursued the strategy of moving to tax credits, which was universally welcomed. He is now making structural changes in the pensions area. These changes will be a challenge to existing methods and present new opportunities to providers of pension products. As the Minister stated, these changes are in the interest of those who count, that is, the pensioners who worked and saved to accumulate the pension fund. The new arrangements for pension provisions will allow greater choice and flexibility in this area. These apply mainly to the self-employed and while the details of the legislation on the new pension rules are not in the Bill as published, they will be included on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New tax incentives for owner-occupiers of housing in rural renewal tax designated areas will promote the attractiveness of such areas for residential purposes. This will be a major boost to rural Ireland, especially larger urban areas. Tax changes will allow a special Government bond <Col N="1018" /> programme to be undertaken by the NTMA to improve liquidity in the bond market.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill implements the £600 million budget tax package aimed at the lower paid. It gives effect to the major fundamental changes in personal taxation contained in this year's budget. The move towards a full tax credit system introduces significant new reliefs to help various categories of taxpayers. It provides new reliefs to promote economic and rural development. It also sets out the first major and substantial overhaul of pension tax rules in 30 years. This will provide individuals with a genuine choice and a greater say in their pension arrangements.</P>
    <P>Regarding older people, the Bill provides for an increase of £9 a week for a pensioner couple. This is made up of an increase of £6 per week in the full personal rate of old age pension and related pensions and of £3 a week for qualified adults. The increases will apply from June 1999.</P>
    <P>The key income tax provisions include the standard rating of personal allowances which are increased by £1,050 to £4,200 per annum for a single person and by £2,100 to £8,400 per annum for a married couple. PAYE allowances have been standard rated and increased by £200 to £1,000. The standard rate tax bands have been increased from £10,000 to £14,000 for a single person and from £20,000 to £28,000 for a married couple. The effect of these changes will be, among other things, to ensure that single people on PAYE will not pay income tax on any earnings under £100 per week and to remove over 80,000 people from the tax net.</P>
    <P>Regarding business taxation, I welcome the certainty which has been provided for the business sector as a result of the announcements in relation to corporation tax changes. These include the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 32 per cent to 28 per cent with effect from 1 January 1999; the confirmation that the standard rate of corporation tax for trading income will be reduced by 4 per cent per annum for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 and by 3.5 per cent in 2003, giving a 12.5 per cent rate on trading income in 2003, and the clarification of the categories of passive income which will fall to be taxed in the future as non-trading income at the 25 per cent rate which are provided in the summary of 1999 budget measures. These provisions will help to ensure that Ireland continues to be an attractive location for foreign investment.</P>
    <P>The personal rates for those in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowances will bring social welfare rates for all categories to at least the minimum recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. These improvements will apply from June 1999. Child benefit will be increased by £3 a month for the first and second children and by £4 a month for third and subsequent children. These changes will take effect in September 1999.</P>
    <P>Regarding farming, the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme has been revamped at a full cost of £15 million. I hope small farmers <Col N="1019" /> will also benefit under the new farm assistance scheme, which will come into effect in April 1999.</P>
    <P>An additional £45.5 million has been provided for current spending in the health area for further improvements in services, including the hospital waiting lists initiative and services for the elderly and those with a mental handicap. Total gross spending on health in 1999 will be £3.549 billion, an increase of £334 million on the 1998 level. A total of £29.6 million of the health increases are in the social inclusion area.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to reducing the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and improve the incentive to work. In this regard, the Government has, after careful consideration, decided to move to a tax credits system. This process is due to commence in 1999 by standard rating the basic single and married personal allowances and the PAYE allowances. Future budgets will complete the change over to tax credits.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Finance Bill gives effect to the announcement in the budget of a move towards a tax credit system by increasing the basic single and married personal allowances and providing that the relief from tax flowing from these allowances will be confined to the standard rate of tax.</P>
    <P>In the past, the basic widowed person's allowance was £500 higher than the basic single personal allowance. To maintain this differential between single and widowed persons, the section also provides for an additional personal allowance of £500 allowable at marginal rates for widowed persons. Section 5 provides for an additional personal allowance for widowed parents and other single parents. The section provides for a new standard rate allowance of £1,050, the maintenance of the existing widowed parent's allowance of £2,650, which is allowable at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, and the maintenance of the existing single parent allowance of £3,150, which is allowable at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate.</P>
    <P>Section 12 increases the amount of the basic exemption from tax in respect of non-statutory redundancy payments. Currently the basic exemption is set at £6,000 plus £500 for each complete year of service. These figures will be increased to £8,600 and apply in respect of payments made on or after 1 December 1998.</P>
    <P>Section 21 amends the penalty system for late filing of the employer's end of year return. Currently, failure to meet the specified deadline for filing the return results in a flat rate penalty of £1,200. This has now been reduced to a £500 penalty, increasing over a four month period to £2,000. I welcome this because many employers have been caught at short notice regarding the return of the P35 and were liable to the substantial penalty of £1,200. I welcome the reduction to £500.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Finance Bill. However, I appeal to the Minister to make substantial financial provision to address the current <Col N="1020" /> crisis in agriculture. I make a special case for small farmers in counties like Kerry, many of whom have serious financial problems. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on this very progressive Finance Bill. The Bill contains a series of important initiatives which reform the tax system in favour of the lower paid. Personal taxes for all taxpayers are cut and significant new tax reliefs are introduced. The Minister has considerably strengthened the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to combat tax evasion.</P>
      <P>The personal tax package in this Finance Bill will amount to £600 million in a full year. That will benefit every taxpayer, particularly people aged over 65 and those on low incomes. The Finance Bill measures remove 80,000 taxpayers from the tax net. Of those, 15,000 are aged over 65. It is particularly heartening that the taxation measures are targeted at the lower paid and the elderly. The measures deliver on the promises made to reduce the tax burden and to improve considerably the position of the less advantaged in the community.</P>
      <P>The social welfare measures announced in the budget constitute the largest social welfare and social inclusion package introduced by the current Government. The full year cost of this budget's new social welfare and social inclusion measures is £378 million. It is calculated that in the period 1997-99 almost £1 billion extra will have been spent on social inclusion measures, nearly double the target in Partnership 2000. That expenditure is very welcome and very necessary to give the less advantaged better opportunities in society, in social welfare and in getting back into employment or entering employment for the first time.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the budget measures was the older citizen and the family. I welcome in particular many of the improvements envisaged in the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foley mentioned the plight of farmers. In my county there are very severe difficulties. Most of the farmers are small-scale producers engaged in intensive production and they work very hard to make a living. This Government has reintroduced the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes which were abolished by Deputy Yates when he was Minister for Agriculture and Food. Those measures are particularly necessary and welcome in the area I represent, the Cavan-Monaghan region, where there is drumlin soil and particular difficulties with high rainfall, and people in the farming community have to provide substantial on-farm investment to provide housing and the necessary facilities to carry on intensive farming activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A particular concern of the farming community for many months has been the very poor prices paid for cattle. Unfortunately, despite the success of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, in negotiating a substantial increase in <Col N="1021" /> export refunds at the European Commission and in having a very successful intervention package reopened by the European Commission&mdash;</P>

When the current Minister, Deputy Walsh, went to Europe, he was at the table negotiating with his EU counterparts, not at a distance giving the impression to the Irish electorate that there was a gun to his head, as Deputy Yates did when he sold out the farming community.</P>

I do not know what Deputy Yates did when the control of farm pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme were suspended by the rainbow coalition Government. This Government is providing the finance to reintroduce these necessary schemes which particularly benefit small-scale farmers, the people whom I and Fianna Fáil represent. Perhaps the Deputies on the opposite benches are more concerned about large-scale farmers, who already have the investment in place, and do not care to adequately represent the plight of the small farmer.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the income situation of the farming community is still very serious and I am glad the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is introducing the new farm assist scheme. That scheme is essential to give income support to farmers whose financial situation has become <Col N="1022" /> very serious. The Minister stated that the early introduction of this scheme will be part of a package of measures designed to form a practical response on the part of this Government to the plight of low income farmers. The Minister is making changes to the existing smallholder's unemployment assistance scheme by doing away with the signing on arrangements and ensuring that people who are on smallholder's assistance can transfer to the new farm assist scheme. That scheme will assist in the region of 14,000 farm families. I hope that social welfare officials will deal with individual cases as rapidly as possible to ensure that those who need income support get payment as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension the Minister is proposing to the rural renewal scheme, which is applicable in the west of my county. I appeal to the Minister to consider the inclusion of all County Cavan under the rural renewal scheme. A strong case can be put forward for the inclusion of the Border counties which have suffered immeasurable damage over a period of 30 years. We did not experience the economic development that other counties did. We did not manage to attract inward investment. We lagged behind in getting investment and in getting jobs on the ground. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were the only parties who were in favour of regionalisation. In various debates on the subject in this Chamber I instanced that the Border counties have had the highest rate of unemployment and, contrary to what the Labour Party and in particular Deputy Proinsias De Rossa stated on many occasions, the highest percentage of long-term unemployment has been in the Border region.</P>
      <P>The Government has had the courage and foresight to regionalise this country and to ensure that the areas which have not been able to take full advantage of Structural Funds over the years and have not progressed and developed as rapidly as the counties on the east coast will be given the opportunity to make progress with the draw-down of Structural Funds in the next few years.</P>
      <P>I have consistently raised with Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the need to attract inward investment to the Border region and to the Cavan-Monaghan area in particular. Perhaps the Minister could ensure some special measures are put in place to make those areas more attractive for potential investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that, in response to a parliamentary question yesterday, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated that the Government is committed to ensuring a better spread of development, that the Border region, County Cavan in particular, is a priority location for IDA Ireland and that the agency will introduce a number of significant measures to encourage new investment to this area which is very important. I appeal to the different Departments and various State industrial development agencies to ensure areas which have not benefited <Col N="1023" /> from inward investment in the past will be given the opportunity now and that they will be promoted vigorously to ensure they get new employment opportunities, so that the decline in the rural population can be halted, thus ensuring a balance in the distribution of population in Ireland. I know similar problems exist in Northern Ireland where the area west of the Bann has not benefited from the development the area east of the Bann has experienced. The same has occurred here with development predominantly occurring on the east coast, while the north-west and west suffer. I am glad the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has given instructions to the relevant development agencies to ensure they prioritise the Border region in terms of employment and the introduction of measures to generate employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Finance Bill, which is probably the best I have seen since I was elected to the Dáil. It should be so, considering the economic situation in which we find ourselves. Interest rates, unemployment and taxes have reduced over a number of years. A succession of Governments have put the building blocks in place to develop the economy and long may that continue under whoever is in Government. We endured many years of mistakes with the economy. Since 1987, the right decisions have fortunately been made. Hard decisions were made then but society is now seeing the welcome benefits.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measures in the Bill relating to tax. All taxpayers have benefited from them, especially the lower paid. The introduction of tax credits is a welcome step in the right direction. I hope we will see further such steps next year so that a more equitable and fairer tax system will be in place with many of the anomalies ironed out.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the changes in the social welfare system, especially for senior citizens. We all want to see them well catered for and that has happened again this year. A £9 increase for a couple is very good. The increases will be welcomed by everyone and seen as a good step towards helping senior citizens.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change towards recognition of carers who have not been recognised in the past. All parties have urged various Ministers of Finance to recognise the work of carers in the home. It is a difficult job at times and we have all encountered constituents in our clinics or received phone calls telling of the difficulties they face as carers. This change towards recognition is a step in the right direction and it is to be hoped it will be improved upon in coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the increases in child benefit. Child Care is a major issue and the Minister should ensure the Government does not drag its heels on the report on this subject. I understand why it must go to various Departments and I do accept that it should be implemented immedi<Col N="1024" /> ately. One encounters many conflicting reports and opinions on this area in the papers and on the radio. I chair the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights at a meeting of which last week a number of groups with an interest in this area made representations. There was a good deal of conflict among members of the committee about how best to proceed. I ask the Departments examining the report to make their decisions quickly and to ensure that money is allocated to child care if it is needed. It is a major issue and a great problem for people, especially in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 63 which gives 100 per cent capital allowances for park and ride facilities. This will help relieve the problem of traffic congestion in urban areas. Deputy Deenihan spoke of the rights of motorists. Section 100 is one measure which motorists should welcome. It reduces the rate of duty on liquid petroleum gas which, taking into account the decrease in VAT, is a reduction of about 1.8 p per litre.</P>
    <P>A vast amount of money is being invested in roads. What about the rights of pedestrians, such as children going to school or old people? The amount of money invested in their rights is very small. Much more money should be invested in that area rather than catering for motorists. I understand the Deputy's frustration to a certain extent. Motorists pay a great deal of tax on their cars, but there are other people on the roads and on the pavements, and pedestrians are one group who are often ignored. They are not a powerful lobby group. We do not receive letters from the Pedestrians' Association of Ireland asking us to increase spending on traffic lights or on widening pavements. It is an area which should be examined. Pedestrians' groups are very vocal in other countries and are hard working lobbyists of politicians. I accept Deputy Deenihan's point, but the pedestrian should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Minister reduced capital gains tax and was heavily criticised by left wing politicians as a result. I am delighted to see that the take from capital gains tax has increased significantly. I have said for years that the 40 per cent rate was outrageous and to reduce it would be a good thing because it would result in an actual increase in yield. No one who buys shares, especially one who pays tax on their income and then buys shares, should have to pay 40 per cent tax on the profits they receive. It was outrageous and crazy and to decrease it was a good thing. It will encourage people to buy shares, I hope in Irish companies, which is good for the economy. It also strengthens small and medium-sized companies if they invest in the area. That is a good step.</P>
    <P>One item which was left out of the Bill and which I would like the Minister to examine is credit unions. They are anxious that there is nothing in the Finance Bill about credit unions and perhaps the Minister could refer to it when he is summing up or raise it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the changes in pension schemes which the <Col N="1025" /> Minister has made, I agree that the notion that anyone who has been self-employed for 30 years would get a rush of blood to the head and spend all their pension money is ridiculous. It is a good thing they are allowed flexibility in this matter. The investment and pension world has changed dramatically over the past years and will probably do so over the next few years. To give people more flexibility about where they invest their money to maximise the return for themselves in their retirement is a good thing. Generally people welcome it but I know some people with vested interests are not in favour of it. It will be seen as a good measure.</P>
    <P>On the area of relief for film making, a subject close to my heart as I was involved with film groups, I welcome the extension to 2000 but it must be said that other countries are becoming more attractive to film makers. Ireland is not as attractive as it used to be and we need to devise a long-term plan for the future. There is a long lead-in period to film production and people want more security in terms of what will happen after the year 2000. Will the Minister examine this area which has been good for Ireland and the film industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in urban renewal because, like Deputy Smith, I believe that we must try to keep people on the land and in rural areas. Dublin is groaning under the pressure of an increasing population and I have no doubt Cork and other urban areas will experience the same difficulties. There is a lack of planning in our urban areas. Traditionally we are not an urban based population and we are experiencing many difficulties. Many mistakes are being made and we must try to encourage people to remain in rural areas. It is better for them and for people living in urban areas. Dublin is experiencing traffic congestion, housing problems and other difficulties common to urban areas. We must encourage development in rural areas because if we do not, we will have an urban area that extends from Dundalk, down to Arklow and out to Mullingar. That will not be pleasant.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in spending on health of £334 million and also the waiting list initiative of £20 million. It is extraordinarily arrogant of Deputy McManus, who was appointed to her position only a month ago, to table a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health and Children. The Deputy should have spent some time familiarising herself with her brief. The Minister has increased spending on health by £334 million and yet the Deputy tables a vote of no confidence in him. That is extraordinary action for any Deputy to take. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome, from an environmental point of view, the provision in the Bill to provide exemption from benefit-in-kind tax to monthly or annual bus or train tickets given by employers to employees or directors &ndash; that curious phrase we find in section 28. That is a positive measure and will help to encourage the use of public transport. Although it is a welcome measure, there are areas where it will have little effect. In my constituency it will certainly be of benefit where we have the Arrow rail service. It will be of benefit to those relatively limited areas of my constituency where we have a limited Bus Éireann service but there are other areas where it will have no effect.</P>
      <P>Not surprisingly, the section goes on to state that the exemption will apply in respect of a bus or train pass issued in respect of a scheduled licensed passenger transport service. It is normal in a Bill being promoted by the Government that that provision should be made, but it excludes bus transport availed of by a substantial number of people travelling on what we euphemistically call club travel arrangements. It is outside the terms of the Bill but it is fair to point out that we need to have a more enlightened view and a more liberalised approach to the provision of road passenger transport services.</P>
      <P>The monopoly of Bus Éireann, diluted as it is by a small number of other scheduled services, is not serving the people of rural Ireland very well. A substantial number of people who commute regularly to Dublin and to other major urban centres will not benefit from this system because the services they use are not licensed scheduled passenger services in the meaning attached to it by the Bill, yet they deserve to be treated in the same way as their other colleagues. I make that marker in favour of the liberalisation of road passenger transport and I would like to see the Government making some progress on that in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two other measures which will have an important effect are the provision to continue and extend tax relief for the construction of multi-sto<Col N="1027" /> rey car parks, although I know many environmentalists are against them &ndash; I do not share that view &ndash; and, perhaps even more important from the point of view of an outside of Dublin Deputy like myself, the provision in relation to tax reliefs and incentives for park and ride facilities. The Minister of State may find it unusual that I am praising the Bill from this side of the House but I favour this measure and argued for it for a long time; my colleagues and I have argued for the bus and rail pass benefit-in-kind exemption for some time and it nice to see the Government finally implementing some of the measures we have urged on it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that not only are park and ride facilities in the Dublin area being considered but Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford are included also because those cities now have a major congestion problem and they will all benefit from the provision of park and ride facilities. I am delighted that the county areas of Kildare and those of Meath and Wicklow are included also because a substantial number of people commute every day into Dublin from those counties and the provision of park and ride facilities will help substantially to ease the burden of traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>In this context I repeat my point about the need to liberalise road transport services because not many people in Limerick or in Galway, for example, can benefit from the normal road passenger or rail transport services. More people could benefit if we liberalised access to the provision of road passenger transport, and the same would apply in the case of Dublin. I would like to see those measures, useful and welcome as they are, given even greater effect by a rational approach to the provision of road passenger transport services.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decrease in the rate of duty on liquid petroleum gas. That is a good measure which will encourage people to use more environmentally friendly forms of road transport, such as cars fuelled by LPG, but I urge the Minister to go even further. There are coherent proposals from the Irish LPG association which would complement the measure proposed in the budget. Experience in other countries, and in the UK in particular, has shown that subsidies for vehicle conversion to LPG can achieve substantial results in terms of increased usage. In relative terms, this country has a far more widely based and accessible retail infrastructure for LPG. An increase in usage could result in substantial benefits to the environment. It is time to consider reducing the burden of road tax on cleaner fuelled vehicles, including those fuelled by LPG. It could well be time to consider a reduction in the vehicle registration tax for vehicles which use cleaner fuels, including LPG.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the wide powers proposed for the Revenue Commissioners to detect abuses of the tax system. My colleague, Deputy Noonan, has already indicated our support in <Col N="1028" /> principle for those measures, but a degree of suspicion and hesitancy about the detail of the measures. There is one other thing which ought to be done and if it is necessary to give powers to the Revenue Commissioners to do it, that should be done. All the tax scams which have given rise to scandals down the years, including some recent ones, have been conducted largely in the open. Since the mid-1980s we have all become used to reading advertisements in newspapers by financial institutions, brokers and advisers for high yielding investments. If necessary, the Revenue should be given powers to examine the details of every scheme which is marketed publicly and to make the provider of that financial service or instrument explain exactly what is proposed and how it works. If the service breaches the law, the Revenue should have the power to state it may not be marketed. The NIB schemes, about which we have heard so much lately, were advertised on the radio, in newspapers, in magazines and even on television and the Revenue Commissioners did nothing while all these things were being advertised and allowed them to happen. People were drawn into these schemes and they infringed the law. It is only now we are finding out the kind of action which should be taken. There should be preventive action to stop those things happening. A unit in the Revenue Commissioners should be dedicated to an examination of schemes before they get off the ground and give rise to these kinds of problems.</P>

      <P>Section 41 relates to the rural renewal scheme and the enhancement of residential tax relief. While these residential tax reliefs are welcome, the Minister for Finance is well aware of my reservations about the scheme. Minister McCreevy will always be known in County Roscommon as the man who partitioned the county into the haves and the have nots. He has divided the county in half with this scheme. However, beggars cannot be choosers and, therefore, I must welcome the move regarding residential tax reliefs, but these reliefs will not bring one extra job to the deprived areas of County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fanfare which greeted the announcement of the tax designation included incentives of 50 per cent capital allowance for commercial buildings and structures as under the urban renewal scheme &ndash; these are not available; 100 per cent capital allowance for industrial allowance buildings as under the urban renewal scheme &ndash; these are not available; 50 per cent capital allowances for the development of water, sewerage and road projects for public purposes as approved by the planning authority &ndash; these are not available; and double rent allowances for ten years for leases of commercial and industrial buildings &ndash; these are not available. The rural tax designation which, according to the announcement, would save this part of rural Ireland has been nothing more than a deceitful smokescreen. While the scheme was announced in December 1997, it was not submit<Col N="1029" /> ted to Brussels until last September because the Government was trying to push through the Dublin docklands development before making the case for rural renewal. It took ten months to submit the proposals and the EU is still awaiting a reply to its queries from the Department of Finance. These questions are lying on the desk in the Department of Finance for the past two months. The Government is giving higher priority to the Dublin docklands than to the rural renewal scheme because the &ldquo;Dublin first&rdquo; approach of the Government has little to offer the people of the west.</P>
    <P>This is the same Government which has a £25 million fund in the bank which was supposed to be for the Western Development Commission. Why has it been delayed? Why can we not gain access to this £25 million? The fund was established on 1 February, but the £25 million lies in the bank and it will not be available until the end of the year because the Government is sitting on its laurels and has not drawn up the guidelines regarding the distribution of these funds which are supposed to encourage investment in industrial development in the region. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will ensure those funds are made available immediately.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed dismally to encourage investment in the west. While it may have submitted the Objective One proposal to the Commission, it is clear Dublin and the east is the Government's first priority. Earlier Deputies spoke about Objective One and the drawing down of Structural Funds as if they would be the golden millions which would save the west. That is not the case. Structural Funds and Objective One status is about ensuring the Government can make maximum grants available to these regions, but unless it is committed to providing the funds to the west, the midlands and Border counties, we are wasting our time talking about Objective One status because EU funding will involve only small amounts of money. The priority must come from the Department of Finance and from within Government circles. As we have seen from rural tax designation and the Western Development Commission Act, 1998, the Government has not set itself the goal of developing the west. That is reflected at the Cabinet table where there is not one Minister from the west. The Government, whose first priority is Dublin, must begin to recognise there is a large population outside the pale. The Minister for Finance must remove his rose-tinted glasses and implement his commitments immediately instead of trying to pull the wool over our eyes.</P>
    <P>There is one man, the man on the white horse, who will single-handedly destroy rural Ireland, that is the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. Deputy Smith spoke earlier about re-introducing the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene grant. I hope it will not take as long to do that as it has taken to re-introduce the installation aid scheme. It took between 12 and 18 months for the application <Col N="1030" /> forms to become available, but we were given the impression this time last year that it would happen in only a few weeks. It will be the same with the CFP and the dairy hygiene grant. The funds must be made available immediately and not at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Problems in farming are extremely serious and the Minister is doing nothing to deal with them. He has held up REPS payments for the past month and a half because his Department could not deal with the conversion to the euro. For the past year the Government has been advising industry to prepare for the introduction of the euro but the Department of Agriculture and Food did not do so. The Minister is speaking of giving farmers a top-up payment of £300 while money which should have been paid to farmers months ago, including REPS and headage payments, is lying in his Department. If farmers had received these payments they would not need the top-up payment of £300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 105 deals with vehicle registration tax. The Minister should, perhaps in next year's Finance Bill, consider giving tax relief to car hire companies who install electronic devices which warn visiting motorists to drive on the left hand side of the road. The road accident figures for 1997, which are the latest available, show that eight foreigners were killed and 216 injured in road accidents, accounting for 2.5 per cent of road accidents. These figures do not include the number of Irish people killed by visiting drivers. Road accident deaths destroy families and I hope the Minister will consider such a measure. The Government claims to prioritise road safety and a device of this type, for which a prototype is available, could easily be developed and installed in hire cars. Car hire companies have failed to take any action in this and it is essential that the Minister for Finance examine the possibility of having such devices installed in cars and granting tax relief to car hire firms who have them. I have raised this matter in the House on previous occasions. Every summer tragic accidents are caused by foreign motorists driving on the wrong side of the road. If it is not possible to amend this <Col N="1031" /> Bill I hope such a measure will be included in next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for allowing me to share his time and to speak on this very important issue. Deputy Naughton has referred to serious anomalies in the upper Shannon relief scheme. While I welcome the changes regarding tax incentives for owner occupiers, many incentives for expenditure on the construction and refurbishment of certain industrial and commercial buildings are being held up because the commercial aspect of the Bill has not been agreed by the EU. It is regrettable that while this scheme was announced a year and a half ago the Department of Finance has not yet received clearance from the EU to initiate the scheme. Much work is being held back because of this. A recent special report on the social and economic position of County Sligo recommended that the designation status for industrial grant purposes be maintained and promoted. It was assumed that Sligo regional airport would benefit from designation status. It now emerges that the airport will not receive any benefit. There are major concerns about the upper Shannon relief scheme.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that new car prices, before the imposition of VRT, are significantly lower in Ireland than in the United Kingdom? At times up to 40,000 used cars per annum are imported into Ireland. None are exported despite similar rates of depreciation in both countries. While the Revenue Commissioners have calculated the appropriate VRT to be applied on the importation of used cars they have no power to refund a similar amount on the export of a used car. This is a serious anomaly. Will the Minister ensure that such a refund of the residual element of VRT, as calculated as appropriate by the Revenue Commissioners, is granted on the exportation of used cars so that Irish car owners and garages can have access to used car markets in other EU countries in the way that others have access to the Irish used car market? Irish garages are deprived of the benefit of the single market because they are not in a position to sell used cars to other EU countries because of the high level of VRT imposed on cars in Ireland. What steps will the Minister take to ensure that Irish car owners and garages have access to used car markets in other EU countries? </P>
      <P>Deputy Naughton referred to the Western Development Commission. The commission was established on 1 February and the terms and conditions for the fund have been established. The sponsoring Departments, notably the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have not given the necessary clearances and funds cannot be released. It is regrettable that the commission which is statutorily established cannot release any of the £25 million. Can he clarify the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can he also clarify the position of the commercial aspect of the upper Shannon relief scheme? <Col N="1032" /> In south Sligo, a developer is prepared to build 55,000 square feet of industrial units on a commercial park of 3.5 acres as soon as the scheme is announced which will allow him the capital allowance. I appeal to the Minister not to link the scheme to the Dublin docks scheme. The scheme will stand alone and I appeal to the Minister to announce the timescale for the scheme.</P>

      <P>I too refer to Section 105 regarding VRT. The Minister described these changes as a green tax which would reduce toxic emissions and improve the environment. I challenge this description. The measure discriminates against the diesel engine. I did not think I would extol the virtues of the diesel engine which has always been regarded as noisy and dirty. The diesel engine has been with us for 100 years but it has been greatly refined in the last four or five years. It is now a much quieter engine and traps have been installed to catch matter before it is emitted into the atmosphere. Smoke emissions from diesel engines have been reduced. Diesel engines burn much less fuel than petrol engines and emit less carbon dioxide which is one of the greenhouse gases which we are committed to reducing under the terms of the Kyoto protocol. The diesel engine is willing to do that for us but the Minister discriminates against it. The new type of engine emits less particulate matter. This is one of the new words in terms of air emissions and reducing air pollution. It is very much to the fore in terms of environmental health and is an issue that has not been addressed to date. This type of engine is also much quieter than the petrol engine.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Dukes, referred to liquid petroleum gas and said vehicle registration tax should address not only engine capacity but the type of fuel used. Diesel engines should also be considered given that they are more environmentally friendly than petrol engines. What research has the Minister for Finance carried out and did he consult with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government before introducing changes in the VRT bands, given that the changes do not take into account the diesel engine? I would welcome some changes in this area.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to child care and the proposals contained in the budget. Child benefit has not been increased sufficiently. Fine Gael policy to increase child benefit would help to address the differences in this argument. Parents should be given the money. It is then their prerogative to decide whether to spend it on child care facilities or babysitters. This would go a long way towards addressing the imbalances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 29 provides that where employers provide a place in a child care facility it will not be taxed as a benefit-in-kind. It also provides that where a number of employers come together for the purpose of providing child care facilities it will <Col N="1033" /> not be taxed as a benefit-in-kind. Will the Minister take this a stage further? A small employer in a small town will not get involved in financing or providing child care places. If they bought a place in a local nursery and put it at the disposal of their employees would the Minister be prepared to consider it? This is a matter about which those providing child care feel strongly. This section addresses the larger employer but does nothing for the small employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the Bill. Given its size, I thought it was the consolidated Bill. This is one of the largest Finance Bills in the history of the State with up to 200 sections. They are not just padding. Many of the sections introduce important initiatives which will reform the tax system in favour of the lower paid, cut personal taxes for all taxpayers, introduce new tax reliefs, set out arrangements for pension provisions and strengthen the powers of the Revenue to combat tax evasion. The Bill is indicative of the character of the Minister for Finance, a man who is not afraid to grasp the nettle and take innovative decisions.</P>
      <P>I wish to address some of the misconceptions perpetrated by the Opposition, as well as some other parties, concerning the Government's approach and that of the Minister to tax reform and Fianna Fáil's tax policy in general.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the Taoiseach requested me to head up a committee to prepare a tax reform package to be implemented on our return to Government. The main planks of our policy were aimed at encouraging people into the workforce, to promote business development and to take the lower paid out of the tax net. The document was produced and accepted by the Front Bench in January 1997. It included provisions to direct tax cuts towards reducing the top rate of income tax and the basic rate over a five year period to 44 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively &ndash; the rates have already been reduced significantly in a two year period; to control public spending, to introduce a carers tax allowance, consider reducing capital gains tax and to clarify the role and ownership of semi-State companies, all of which were introduced by the Minister in his first budget. As well as the tax reform package there were two important words which are critical to any real change in the taxation system, &ldquo;tax credits&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax credits system proposal does not belong exclusively to any one party. The Commission on Taxation chaired by Miriam Hederman O'Brien, ten or 15 years ago, advised that to make the tax system equitable the tax credits system was the way forward. We looked at that proposal and decided it was time to grasp that nettle to ensure those who benefit in the years ahead under the taxation system will be the poor and the less well off in society. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, took the plunge this year by introducing the tax credits system to a degree. After being goaded over the past year that Fianna Fáil was <Col N="1034" /> afraid to take this direction the Government was abused and denigrated by Deputies Bruton and Noonan who claimed this system was stolen from them. They implied it was the sole prerogative of Fine Gael to bring in a tax credits system. However, we had the idea and we introduced it. That is the difference between the party on this side and the party on the other side. We are a party of action, not a party of the debating society or the literary and historical society of UCC, UCD or wherever. We are a party that sees what has to be done and takes action, not for our own benefit but for the poor and the less well off.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan criticised the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for not going far enough. Criticism for criticism sake is unworthy of him, a man for whom I have great admiration, having worked with him on the committee during the past year and a half. He examines all the propositions put before him in an objective manner. I am surprised he did not examine the proposed change in the system in an objective and honourable way. The Minister has said this is the first step and that he will progress in his next three budgets to give it full effect.</P>
    <P>As in many areas of legislation, whether social welfare, health or education, Fianna Fáil has introduced a seminal change in the taxation system to benefit the lower paid, the weak and the less well off in society. One of the cornerstones of our policy was to reduce the tax burden on the lower paid. The decision to increase the level at which someone begins paying tax to £100 per week is a positive step in this direction. We must reward employment, not unemployment. It is imperative to co-ordinate the tax and social welfare systems to ensure people are better off working than on the dole. I look forward to greater movement towards the merging of the tax and social welfare systems in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In the short time I have, I can only touch on some of the many welcome new proposals by the Minister in this Bill. I wish to share my time with Deputy Dennehy.</P>

      <P>Massive funding has been committed to the acute hospital system; over £700 million extra has been put into that system since this Government came into office. However, acute beds are still being occupied by patients for whom there are no convalescent beds. One of the great problems adding to waiting lists is that people cannot get into convalescent homes after their operations. The Government has noted the dire shortage of convalescent beds, which the Minister is addressing under section 42 by introducing capital allowances for expenditure on private convalescent facilities. This is a very welcome and worthwhile provision, which will give a kick start to business people to develop those facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child care facilities are a problem for every <Col N="1035" /> sector and area of the country. This problem is increasing due to the number of women returning to work. The Government recognises the need for child care facilities and two approaches were taken in the budget in that regard. Capital allowances for expenditure on child care facilities which meet the required standard, as provided for in the Child Care Act, 1991, will help people to provide these facilities. The Minister made a further change whereby the provision of child care facilities by employers on a free or subsidised basis will no longer be subject to benefit in kind income taxation. This is another helpful provision which will go some way towards reducing the cost of child care facilities. More must be done to meet this demand but I have no doubt that the Government will provide those facilities over the coming years.</P>
    <P>Section 44 is a very significant section aimed at the provision of sufficient rented residential accommodation for third level students at a reasonable cost. Every September and October there is a mad rush in every town with an institute of technology or a university for student accommodation, which is not cheap. It is important to provide standard, clean accommodation &ndash; it need not be plushly furnished &ndash; at a relatively cheap cost. The Minister is helping in this regard by giving capital allowances under section 44 for the provision of such accommodation. I look forward to many people taking up the challenge to provide the necessary facilities for students.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a very important change in regard to retirement pensions. Up to now, a self-employed person had only one pension option, a retirement annuity. On retirement, a self-employed person was obliged to surrender his accumulated pension fund to an insurance company, which would then pay him a fixed rate annuity until his death. If there was a balance on the fund it did not revert to his estate. Under this change, the Minister is allowing such a person to make his or her own decision, to a certain extent, on how he or she wishes the accumulated fund to be utilised.</P>
    <P>Some scares have been raised that people would waste their money. However, the majority of self-employed people running their own businesses will not suddenly get a rush of blood to the head and go off to the Caribbean or on a world tour. Of course, some people will fall by the wayside but there cannot be 100 per cent certainty about anything. This is a very good and welcome innovation by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    <P>Irish registered non-resident companies have been a thorn in the side of this country in recent years, especially over the past year and a half. This did nothing for our reputation. I am glad the Minister has brought in a package of measures which are a comprehensive and focused response to the problems caused by certain IRNR companies. This package will sort out the problem of people utilising and abusing the system.</P>
    <P>The powers being given to the Revenue are <Col N="1036" /> causing a certain amount of concern. They are a result of what has been made public at the tribunals. When Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance a number of years ago he brought in a section which was termed a whistle blower's proposal and which was turned down as a result of immense pressure from solicitors, accountants, etc. The main concern being expressed is that the Revenue will investigate the accounts of every individual, but I do not think that will happen. However, it would be no harm to have a body or ombudsman which could assess an aggrieved person's case rather than having to go through the Revenue appeals system. That would remove some people's fears. There is a schizophrenic element in our attitude to taxation. We all believe everyone should pay their taxes but we do not want checking of tax payments. I agree with Deputy Dukes' view that financial schemes which yield high earnings should be examined. If they are to yield higher interest rates than any other institution, there is a risk involved. Where there is a high risk, people will take big chances. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Considering its volume, which is akin to that of the Taxes Consolidation Act, it is difficult to believe it was produced in such a short time. It displays a consistent trend, about which we spoke last year and which the Minister has flagged. I am sure he will put the Bill's provisions into practice over the next three years.</P>
      <P>When I spoke on the Finance Bill last year, I complimented my colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, who headed up the backbenchers' review group on taxation when Fianna Fáil was in Opposition. The difference between it and other review groups in the past is that its recommendations are being implemented. I welcome the general changes which are occurring in this area. As somebody involved in the care of the elderly over the years, I particularly welcome the many good aspects of the Bill which relate to elderly people whether they be taxpayers, those requiring accommodation in private nursing homes or others.</P>
      <P>A number of specific issues are grabbing attention. One of them relates to the powers accorded to the Revenue Commissioners. In many cases, people want to have it both ways, including Members of this House who have been vocal in seeking the setting up of tribunals, a head on a plate and general retribution while resisting efforts to confer proper powers on the relevant authorities to deal with the scams and general misconduct which occurred. It is not just individuals who have offended. We saw corporate groups and financial institutions taking a slice of the action to such an extent that the ordinary taxpayer was losing confidence in the system and changes were required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has had the will and courage to act on this issue. Deputy Dukes held <Col N="1037" /> a senior position in Government when the advertisements were placed in newspapers and broadcast on the radio. He did not act on his fears at that point, in spite of being a very conscientious public representative. Deputy Dukes expressed suspicion about the details of this scheme which have not yet been announced. These tax evasion schemes were ongoing from the mid 1980's but the Minister for Finance is the first person to act in a proactive way to cut them off. We cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Public reaction to the announcement could be categorised into three groups. The first category is made up of compliant taxpayers, members of the public who welcome the fact that at long last somebody is standing up in this House prior to illegal activities occurring, to put laws in place and confer powers on the relevant authorities. The second category comprises people involved in business &ndash; investors, company people, accountants or others. They envisage administrative problems arising and, in some cases, may envisage a curtailment of their income sources. I am sure their concerns will be put to rest, together with those of groups concerned with civil liberties. The third group is made up of people who availed of this kind of skullduggery, the fraudsters who reaped the rewards of a very lax financial control system. They will be hit the hardest, and rightly so. I applaud the Minister for having the courage and the will to take them on.</P>
    <P>Last year, the fact the Minister closed off so many of these loopholes almost went unnoticed. He is now closing off more loopholes in an attempt to cut off the cosy cartels to which Ministers referred in the past, but failed to tackle. The Minister's background and expertise gives him an insight into this area. He is willing to stand up and be counted and to take on members of his own profession. I am sure he will be very fair in his approach.</P>
    <P>Current standards are unacceptable. I am a Member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and of the Committee of Public Accounts. We have dealt with issues which have highlighted the need for a financial regulatory body for institutions and the need to protect compliant taxpayers who have suffered from these frauds over the years.</P>
    <P>Pensions for the self-employed and others were referred to. If the requirement for people to go to a specific unit of the financial market to transact their business had ever been challenged, it would have been found to be unconstitutional. Were we suggesting people would go berserk and get a rush of blood to the head? They had worked all their lives to provide their own jobs and sources of income. I welcome the changes in this respect. We will hear complaints from some people but it is only fair that others have the option to invest in the best possible source of revenue.</P>
    <P>The pensions issue is a time bomb ticking away. I have read comments by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn concerning it. <Col N="1038" /> However, nothing was done about it until now. I welcome the fact that the Minister is addressing it. Some people's pension provisions are disgraceful. I am working with CIE bus drivers at the moment and cannot believe the circumstances surrounding their pension rights. For example, the pension is terminated on the participant's death and no allowance is made for a spouse. Everybody is aware the State will not be in a position to support people in years to come unless remedial action is taken.</P>
    <P>One of the other issues which has attracted attention is the issue of child care facilities and allowances. Former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald misled stay at home housewives with a promise of £9.60 per week. That did not materialise. People voted for that proposal and were badly caught out. However, it was one of the first times that the need to compensate women who do not wish to participate in work outside the home was recognised. It was a mistake not to include that category in recent studies and we cannot proceed without taking account of those people. The problem of child care must be addressed in a global fashion and proper provision must be made. It is a major problem that will have to be dealt with. The Minister has moved to address it in various ways by providing capital allowances for premises, etc.</P>
    <P>I, like Deputy Michael Ahern, welcome the capital allowances for the provision of private nursing homes. Up to now the State has failed to provide for our older people and I do not believe we will be able to fund such facilities from the public purse in the future. Demographic trends indicate that caring for the elderly will pose a major problem in the next ten to 20 years. Acute hospital beds are occupied by persons who could be catered for with loving care and a welfare type approach. They need nursing and care but do not need to occupy acute hospital beds. However, I will resist any attempt to remove them from hospitals until alternative facilities are available for them. A Fianna Fáil Administration introduced the Private Nursing Homes Act, 1991 which provided for subventions for such persons. The provision for private nursing homes in the Bill is another step forward. I am pleased the Government recognised the human face of our population. We have provided facilities and capital allowances for the establishment of factories and warehouses. Why can facilities not be provided to cater for our older population? </P>
    <P>The Opposition's approach appears to be to table a motion of no confidence in Minister after Minister, irrespective of how excellent he or she is at the job. This mechanism will give us the opportunity, as it gave the Minister, Deputy Cowen last night, to point out the radical changes between 1993 and 1997 and since then. Having been chairman of the Southern Health Board, I have an interest in Cork University Hospital. I welcome the Minister's announcement of an allocation of £2 million for a linear accelerator for cancer treatment. That was a speedy response to <Col N="1039" /> a problem that arose before Christmas owing to a breakdown of the equipment there. I also welcome the capital grants he will make available for the maternity and neo-natal hospital and others.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, many aspects of which are innovative. I am pleased Cork is listed first under the park and ride initiatives, although I accept that is due to the alphabetical order of the list. That scheme was initiated there ten years ago by the town planning officer. Cork Corporation, Cork County Council, CIE and the chamber of commerce invested money in the project and the rest of the country is following that initiative.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dennehy was enthusiastic when concluding his contribution. He is more than committed to his cause, his party. If that was recognised more by his colleagues, he could be promoted to sit on the front bench alongside the Minister of State, Deputy Davern.</P>
      <P>In the time allocated I will not be able to conduct an extensive trawl through the Bill. The annual debate on the Finance Bill involves the Government defending everything in it and the Opposition trying to pick holes in it. It is relatively difficult to argue with most of the contents of this Bill. We are debating it at a time when record resources are available to the Government. Given that, there were opportunities for good news announcements in the budget and in this Bill, and I welcome most of them. I wish to comment on some of the issues in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income tax proposals announced in the budget were welcome. My constituency colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, indicated the tax credit system proposed in the budget, which will be implemented following the enactment of this Bill, emanated from a committee he chaired and was a promise made by Fianna Fáil before the last election, but I do not recollect that promise. The 1997 election debate focused on, among other issues, the debate between the tax credit system proposed by the outgoing Government and the case put forward by the Deputy's party <Col N="1040" /> that we should concentrate solely on reducing the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was too busy battling with the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not I but the Minister of State and his senior colleague who do most of the battling with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>I welcome the tax changes in the budget. We could have a lengthy, but useless, debate on which party's idea it was to introduce a tax credit system. It is a fairer way of spreading whatever resources are available. It will particularly benefit those on a lower income and we all support that concept.</P>
      <P>A dilemma is posed when we debate income tax, corporation tax, VAT, etc. We have a complicated tax system. There is a large number of reliefs and administrative equations in the tax system. There are various reliefs in the Bill which I welcome. It is difficult to argue that we must maintain and expand such reliefs, while also arguing that we should make our tax system less complicated. If the economy continues to remain as strong as it is, I hope that over the next five to ten years we will be able to move not only towards a fairer but a simpler tax system. We will have to move away in time from many of the relief structures in place towards a more simple and straightforward taxation system.</P>
      <P>Towards that end, the Minister, in his budget speech or in the debate on the 1997 Finance Bill, indicated that he would consider reviewing the tax year. Why can we not have a tax year running from January to December? There may be a simple reason as to why the tax year ends at the beginning of April. If the tax year ran from January to December with the provision that returns be made a few months later, it would be clearer and easier to follow not only for self-employed, but for others who are not only trying to plan their tax business but to ensure their accounts are in on time. The Minister might indicate in his reply if he has considered reviewing the tax year.</P>
      <P>Because the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is present, I wish to refer to the rural renewal tax scheme, which has been expanded somewhat in the Bill. We all welcome this type of scheme. Today and tomorrow we will debate Agenda 2000 proposals from Brussels and their impact on rural Ireland. The rural renewal scheme is property based and I do not have any difficulty with that. The Minister of State should argue more strongly for a scheme based as much on enterprise and rural development as on property, letting and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mainstream farming is in crisis. While alternative farming enterprises and small enterprises are not the solution to all farmers' problems, incentives to encourage further expansion in that regard would be helpful. While we have to tidy up the tax system, I welcome the rural renewal scheme, but it should be more extensive, partic<Col N="1041" /> ularly at a time when agriculture and rural Ireland are facing bleak times. I think it must be more extensive and reach not only the townlands in the west, but every townland in the country. It would be helpful if the Minister of State could spend some time over the next few months trying to argue for incentives which would allow people invest time, resources and finance in new types of rural enterprise. I think the response would be positive.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the motor industry. I am sure most speakers have spoken on the VRT proposals and during the debate on the budget most of us mentioned our surprise at the Minister's proposals. Every Minister is entitled to make a mistake or two, and not everything will be perfect in a Finance Bill such as this, but I repeat what I said during the budget debate, namely, that a mistake has been made in the context of the VRT proposals. The motor industry was on its knees ten or 15 years ago, but as a result of better economic circumstances and in particular as a result of the scrappage scheme which provided an incentive for people to purchase new cars, the industry took off. More taxes were collected, with Revenue and the consumer benefiting. The provision in the Finance Bill is a step in the wrong direction and even at this late stage I ask the Minister to re-examine the matter.</P>
    <P>Motoring expenses are high enough already. There had been improvements in the industry and I think this provision is a step backwards. In his defence the Minister cited the environmental aspects of his proposal. Unfortunately, however, I cannot agree with him. My colleagues, Deputy Clune and Deputy Dukes, mentioned LPG and its very low usage here in comparison to other countries, particularly Scandinavia. LPG is a very clean fuel. The Minister's proposals on VRT will make absolutely no improvement in terms of pollution and rates of emission. It would have been more meaningful if he had provided some incentive for an increase in the use of LPG. If he will not do so in this Bill, it is something which should be examined in future.</P>
    <P>A related issue is park and ride facilities, and the provisions in this regard must be welcomed. It is difficult to know what impact the provisions will make as we do not have the sort of public transport infrastructure which will allow a large number of people take advantage of park and ride facilities. Park and ride facilities are, therefore, only one side of the coin. The other side is the necessary infrastructural investment in train and bus services. That is a debate for another day but I hope we will see some progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>What the Minister described as the new social tax reliefs are welcome. Tax relief on private convalescent facilities are very welcome, positive and necessary. We are all aware of the crisis in the hospital system and the need to ensure places are available, particularly for the elderly. I hope that as a result of the tax relief progress will be made.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the betting tax proposals in <Col N="1042" /> section 106. There has been much loose and silly talk about the proposal, but if it is not introduced jobs and revenue will be lost. I welcome the fact that alternative funding proposals are being discussed and hopefully they will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>During a debate some months ago I made the point that we need to put in place a scheme for owners of thoroughbred brood mares. All the incentives are for one side of the equation, and I have no difficulty with them. I think the Department of Agriculture and Food, certainly the Department of Finance, received a submission from the ITBA which does not appear to have been acted upon. I ask that it be examined over the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the men interested in horses sticking together. I know Deputy Bradford and the Minister for Finance have an interest in horses.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill suits the rich whom the Government has no intention of tackling. The introduction of the additional powers for Revenue is because of the tribunals. One would not see what is going on here happening in Italy or with the Mafia, with certain people being kept like the Queen of England, another element being given money and not knowing where they put it and a further element asking for money without us knowing what was done with it. The people are sick and tired of politics and politicians and do not really believe that politics or politicians will take on the rich people. We have heard in the tribunal that Ben Dunne gave away cheques without knowing whether he had signed them.</P>
      <P>I worked hard in the bakery industry and employed a few people and I wondered in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s why no Government would do anything about Mr. Dunne and his likes who were squeezing small business people out of business. He sold bread below cost. Are my comments hurting the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern? Mr. Dunne hurt us and Deputy Davern and his likes did nothing about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind naming him as he is appearing before the tribunals and is currently in the public arena. He caused enough trouble when he was in a powerful position. He squeezed small business and we now know why Governments did nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the new powers being given to Revenue old people who have a few pounds saved for their funeral will not put it in the banks out of fear that Revenue will check their bank accounts. They will be afraid they will lose a small part of their pension. In rural Ireland, as happened in recent years, thugs will beat up and rob <Col N="1043" /> old people. We saw an example of this last week. The Finance Bill is encouraging old people to hold money in their houses rather than put it into financial institutions. Why will the Revenue and Government not take on the banks instead of taking on poor people? Implementation of these Revenue powers will start, not at the top, but at the bottom.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity to discuss the legislation being introduced by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, which speaks about a process involving gardaí, social welfare officers and certain powers. A pilot scheme was undertaken and I do not know why legislation is necessary to extend it. The proposals will not be implemented to any great extent in rural areas as there are no gardaí to implement them. Maybe the social welfare officer will act as a garda since there is a shortage of gardaí. Like Revenue and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will attack small farmers.</P>
    <P>At least the Government has recognised that it has to do something about the problem, and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will introduce the small farmers' scheme to help small farmers who have been attacked by the Department. Like the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs does not realise that a problem still exists in agriculture and that farmers are hardly able to feed their families. We have read this in report after report, but social welfare officers go to small farmers, count the number of cows and sheep and say that the cattle are making £60 or £70 per week. These people are not living in the real world.</P>
    <P>We will soon be living in a police state, like Northern Ireland, if these powers are introduced. I never thought I would see the day when we would have a police state, given that people died to bring freedom to the country. We are not far from a police state. Social welfare officers and gardaí will be stopping people going to mass and funerals. If a garda does not like a person he can stop them to ask where they are going. This is outrageous and should be opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee, which I chair, is supported by a small millennium office located within the Department of the Taoiseach. This office was set up in the latter half of 1998 and currently consists of the secretary to the committee, who is a full-time assistant principal in the Department of the Taoiseach, a projects development officer and a millennium press officer.</P>
      <P>The position of the projects development officer was advertised within the Civil Service at executive officer level. Seven candidates were short listed and interviewed. The successful candidate is on the salary scale level of £17,172. In addition, this officer receives an allowance of £3,000 per year which pertains to the position of projects development officer and will exist for the duration of the millennium commemoration period. The officer's salary and allowances are paid from the millennium subhead in the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tom Rowley was appointed as the millennium press officer with the support of the National Millennium Committee. Mr. Rowley's position is on a contract basis for a period of two years commencing on 15 January 1999. His annual salary is £50,000. An additional performance bonus not exceeding £5,000 per annum is also payable. The amount will be decided by the committee on 1 December 1999 and paid retrospectively. Vouched pension expenses not exceeding £5,000 per annum are also payable. Mr. Rowley's salary and expenses are also paid from the millennium subhead.</P>
      <P>Before the position of millennium press officer was filled, I discussed the matter with about a half a dozen different journalists, including the person whose name was supplied by the Deputy and also public relations people whom I felt might be available for such a short-term assignment or might know of a colleague whom they could recommend. I was satisfied this was the best approach to take in the circumstances especially in the short time scale involved.</P>
      <P>As regards the offer made to the individual named by the Deputy, we discussed a range of possible salaries. However, matters did not develop to the stage where a formal offer was made.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Does he agree he met the journalist in question, who has broken a number of stories seriously damaging to the present Coalition Government, and that an offer of a job for a three year period at a salary of £75,000 was made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the journalist in ques<Col N="1045" /> tion, as I am sure the Deputy and many Members of House would have. We meet him around the House all the time. As I explained in my press release responding to Deputy Rabbitte's suggestions, there was nothing untoward about that. It was a routine discussion with a journalist in the course of which I pointed out that the millennium was on my agenda and that we were looking for a press officer. He responded to the effect that he might be interested himself and we took it from there.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy of what the journalist in question said to the press. He said he dismissed the conspiracy theory. He also said that he was offered the job, considered it, and turned it down and that he did not believe it had anything to do with the story he was working on. He did not go along with the conspiracy idea at all. He was offered the job and thought nothing more of it. I am of the same view. I am a bit surprised that anyone, particularly someone of Deputy Rabbitte's experience, would rush into print with a statement suggesting a conspiracy of some sort. If we started to offer journalists jobs to stop them writing stories, we would have about 4,000 people employed in Government Buildings.</P>

It was always clear that any figures I discussed would be subject to Department of Finance approval.

      <P>Does the Minister of State not accept, in the light of all the extraordinary revelations unfolding on a daily basis, that his approach, not through any form of advertisement, to an investigative journalist of the calibre of Jody Corcoran who was unearthing very unhealthy aspects of the past of this Administration, to offer him a job at a price range of £75,000 per annum way in excess of what he currently earns at the Independent Newspapers Group could be reasonably construed, since he is the Government Chief Whip, as attempting, to use his own phrase, to &ldquo;put a price on his silence&rdquo; so there would be no more investigative revelations from that journalist?

The compilation of court statistics must have due regard for the confidentiality of family law cases and any arrangements to extend the scope of such statistics will have to fully respect such confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted carefully the concerns of the <Col N="1052" /> National Statistics Board and I am in contact with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the improvement of divorce statistics in the context of the modernisation of the General Register Office and of the establishment of the new Courts Service Board. Further consultation is envisaged in the near future.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the Statistics Act, 1993 would only be warranted in the context of a comprehensive solution involving the full consideration of all the issues involved, including the implications for the court statistics and the registration of vital statistics systems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an entirely inadequate reply. Will the Minister of State address the concerns expressed in the report by the National Statistics Board concerning the recording of divorce statistics? The report states it is entirely unsatisfactory that the lack of co-operation between the CSO and the courts means we do not have reliable divorce statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about this matter. We need accurate divorce statistics to plan social policy. The CSO has to compile those statistics with some qualitative analysis of the length of marriage and so on.</P>
      <P>The situation seems to be that the Courts Service Board will review the quality and detail of all statistics produced by the courts when it comes into operation. It may decide to produce more detailed information. In the year ending July 1998, 2,722 divorce applications were received and 1,431 divorces were granted.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that the CSO is anxious to produce more information on this matter. The present information comes from the courts. The courts and the Department are protective of the confidentiality of family law issues and, therefore, the information is not being transmitted other than in a factual sense about the number of applications received and granted.</P>
      <P>An important meeting will take place on 26 February convened by the Department of the Taoiseach which will be attended by the various persons and agencies involved. It is a meeting of officials from the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the CSO. The CSO must have qualitative divorce statistics for social planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State. However, will he indicate what steps he is taking to address the inadequate situation? Will he explain how issues of privacy relating to family law affect the compilation of statistics? Why can the courts not supply the requisite statistical data? No one is looking for names or personal case histories. Why is the Minister of State ruling out an amendment to the Statistics Act, 1993? The only inference which can be taken from this <Col N="1053" /> report is that there ought to be such an amendment to put arrangements between the courts and the CSO on a proper structural basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSO sought to include a provision in the Divorce Act, 1996, to enable it receive statistical returns on individual divorces. The Government sought to have the rules of court introduced to enable the courts to supply detailed information on a voluntary basis. Both of these attempts by the last Government were unsuccessful because of issues relating to protecting the confidentiality of information on individual divorces.</P>
      <P>This is new territory for Ireland and we are beginning to make our way through it. Confidentiality was cited in 1996 as the reason for not including such a provision in the Divorce Act. Presumably the same reason is now proffered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the courts. I would imagine that that is still the case but I cannot confirm it. If one published statistics on the first six cases, half the country could probably name those involved. The divorce figures are now at 2,722 so that may also be an issue.</P>
      <P>When I became responsible for this area I wrote to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on 20 November 1998 asking him to consider establishing a divorce register in the context of modernising the General Register Office. We are still pursuing that matter. I understand heads of a Bill to modernise the General Register Office will be brought to Government in late 1999. I will then pursue the possible inclusion of a divorce register in that Bill.</P>
      <P>I also wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 4 February requesting the issue of more comprehensive divorce statistics to be examined in the context of his review of the establishment of a Courts Service Board. It may be possible to improve the flow of statistics in the context of the courts services board or the General Register Office. A meeting has been called for 26 February with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Central Statistics Office and representatives from the Office of the Taoiseach to try to progress the matter.</P>

      <P>The most recent information available is up to the end of September 1998. In the period January to September 1998, 41,161 births were registered. Of these, 11,439, or 27.8 per cent, were to unmarried mothers. The corresponding figures for the previous year, 1997, was <Col N="1054" /> 52,311 births in total of which 13,892, or 26.6 per cent, were to unmarried mothers.

In addition, it is indicated with regard to a small number of births to married, separated or widowed mothers that the father is not the woman's husband.</P>
      <P>In 1997, there were 2,747 births to teenage mothers. That is almost twice as many as in 1980 when there were 1,431 births. In 1980, 38 per cent of births outside marriage were to teenage mothers. By 1997, this figure had fallen to 19.8 per cent.</P>

Perhaps the Minister of State would prefer us to table questions to enable him to respond, but would he consider it useful if all the facts relating to births to people who are married and unmarried were available? In many cases, weddings follow the birth of the first child. There is an erroneous picture statistically in terms of the number of single parents on lone parent allowances and the percentages in relation to births outside marriage. Does the Minister of State have any intention of requesting the CSO to give the type of breakdown to which Deputy Higgins referred in relation to various urban centres?

      <P>While it is not the norm to divulge details of the deliberations of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, the last meeting of the Cabinet committee took place on 28 January 1999 and the next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, 23 February 1999. In general, as the House is aware, the committee meets on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>The topics discussed at our last meeting related to the three themes of the committee, namely the national anti-poverty strategy, drugs issues and local development issues. A work programme for the coming year on each of these themes and related matters was agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a matter for the Cabinet subcommittee to decide. If it is the Deputy's wish that it be published, I will raise it at the Cabinet subcommittee meeting on 23 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether the views of community groups are being taken into account, with particular reference to drugs, the very structure of the National Drugs Strategy and the local drugs teams allows <Col N="1058" /> for community and voluntary representation which is very significant. That process allows for information and other issues that relate to the local drug task forces and the drugs issue to be filtered through to the National Drugs Strategy. I have political responsibility for the strategy. Therefore, I represent those views to the Cabinet subcommittee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is committed to this task which is of far greater significance than the approach of the Millennium, but would he agree that it is essential, particularly in those communities which are suffering from the ravages of drug infestation and all that it brings in its wake, that ordinary citizens know what this committee is doing or intends to do? Will he not therefore agree that it is highly desirable that the decisions of this committee, where appropriate, are properly publicised and communicated? He might turn to the Minister of State beside him and use the resources of Mr. Rowley to publicise the activities of this committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>That is already happening. Many of the decisions taken by the Cabinet subcommittee are published in the normal course of events. I could refer to a number of them. One is the recent announcement by three of my colleagues on the Cabinet subcommittee on the provision of sports halls attached to second level schools in areas covered by local drugs task forces. This relates to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who came together to provide funding and resources for up to 12 halls attached to schools in those areas. That is one decision that was widely publicised recently. In my direct area of responsibility which relates to local development and to the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, an announcement was made this time last year on which I intend to be in a position to bring forward proposals from the assessment committee at the next meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee next week. In due course, these decisions will also be publicised. The final matter to which I could refer relates to the Integrated Services Project launched by the Taoiseach and given support at that level immediately prior to Christmas. This is making considerable progress. Decisions have now been taken and further announcements will be made during the course of the next two weeks. As decisions are taken that are particularly relevant and important for local communities, they are publicised and communicated locally. I am always seeking ways in which to get the message of the subcommittee through to local people. I am particularly interested in effecting change for communities on the basis of taking action.</P>

This appears to indicate that we are going backwards rather than forwards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the second question, we are making considerable progress in getting to a position where we will be able to announce the establishment of such a committee which I strongly support.</P>
      <P>In regard to the waiting lists of 600 to 700, it is to my eternal regret that that is currently the situation. However, the Deputy and some of his urban colleagues will be particularly aware that this is because efforts by local authorities to establish treatment centres across Dublin have run into severe difficulties because of local objections. I have called previously in this House on people in positions of leadership, which I consider all Members of this House to be, to support the provision of such treatment facilities. Only recently An Bord Pleanála made a decision about one such facility in Tallaght Village which I strongly supported not only publicly in the local area but also by appearing before An Bord Pleanála. Recently An Bord Pleanála took a decision, which it is entitled to do, to turn down that facility which would have provided treatment and counselling for up to 80 addicts. We are finding that the Eastern Health Board, although supported by local drugs task forces, is increasingly frustrated in its attempts to provide treatment facilities which are essential, which I strongly support and which I urge all Members of this House to support whenever the issue arises in their own areas.</P>

      <P>Like the Minister of State, I accept that methadone treatment seems to be the only way to go. That is what the report compiled by Deputy Gregory for the Joint Committee on European Affairs indicated, and there seems to be no other show in town. Has the Cabinet subcommittee on drugs considered the long-term benefits of the methadone treatment programme? Has it carried out any studies and, if so, will it put those studies in the Dáil Library so that Members can familiarise themselves with them?</P>
      <P>Regarding the Young People's Facilities and Services Funds, is the Minister of State aware that some of the independent groups who carried out assessments in their own areas have circulated their findings to groups in their areas? Does the Minister of State consider himself bound by these circulars? What is his position on the recommendations which were sent to him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's second question is that I do not consider myself bound <Col N="1060" /> by any circulars that emanate at local level prior to the work of the assessment committee which is based in my Department assessing each project to ensure that it fits in with the aims and objectives of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund which is an attempt to encourage at-risk young people in areas of deprivation not to become involved in the type of activities which end up in them having to present themselves for treatment. As far as local circulars are concerned, there is a process in place, an assessment committee based in my Department. The results of that assessment activity will be brought to the Cabinet subcommittee. Decisions will then be made based on the conclusions of the assessment committee and on my anxiety to ensure that the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund is used for the purpose for which it was established.</P>
      <P>The issue of whether methadone treatment is a suitable form of treatment is widely debated. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children has brought out a new protocol with regard to the use of methadone. Considerable progress has been made, particularly through the Eastern Health Board, in making methadone available at selected centres under professional supervision, including pharmacists and doctors. Nevertheless, it is a debate that is very considerable.</P>

      <P>At the moment the best opportunity available to us is to use the facility of methadone treatment to assist people presenting themselves for treatment. It is an issue that is increasingly debated. I cannot go into details, but we have briefly considered the issue of methadone treatment at the Cabinet subcommittee. There are divergent views not just there but professionally as well. For the moment it is the best support available to stabilise drug users, unless we take the other route, total abstinence, which may work for a few people, but in my experience, not for the many.</P>

Does he also agree that the Department of Education and Science seems oblivious to the implications of its own lack of activity in the whole area and that, if it were directly represented on the task forces, it would perhaps create or develop a more correct policy towards primary schools in these areas?</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State accept that the opposition about which he spoke is not the full story and that there is need for much more funding in terms of personnel and resources to eradicate waiting lists? Does he also accept that, if that were provided and a campaign conducted for small, local treatment centres, they would be accepted? The fear is of large centres, which have proven to be bad. Does the Minister of State also accept that there is a need for targeted and much more greatly resourced after care in terms of retraining for and rehabilitation of those leaving heroin behind? It is easy to give it up, but staying off it is difficult, so there must be many more resources provided for programmes to enable addicts to stay off drugs and live a new life.</P>

Does he acknowledge that it is a lamentable performance that his accounting officer had to report to the Committee of Public Accounts a few weeks ago that, of the £10 million voted in 1997 and the same amount in 1998, only a cumulative total of £6.1 million has been drawn down? Without the Minister of State driving this programme, does he accept that will be the rate of performance and that it is not good enough in a situation where 600 to 700 young people are crying out for treatment? I say this as someone who acknowledges the Minister of State's support for the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with questions in the order they were asked. I agree with Deputy Quinn on the fear of local treatment and the need to publish more information. We are preparing significant publications, through the National Drugs Strategy Team in particular, which we will circulate in all the areas referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concentrating on the issue of drugs and heroin abuse and the need to put the message across to local communities. Communication is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding local treatment centres and the fear which has been raised by a number of Deputies, I have no difficulty with and would encourage local debate, discussion and consultation, providing <Col N="1062" /> those participating do not assume that, through the process of discussion, they have the right to a veto and can decide whether to have in their area a treatment centre which is intended to meet the needs of local people.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Gregory's reference to the Department of Education and Science, it is important it participates in local drugs task forces and I accept its participation to date has been sporadic. However, I thank the VEC structure for the support it has given to both local drugs task forces and the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund. It became very involved and is one of the funding agencies appointed by my predecessor, Deputy Rabbitte, and has been particularly helpful. However, I would like to see a stronger participation by the Department of Education and Science in the local drugs task forces and that is something on which I am working with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins referred to the need to have smaller treatment facilities. I agree the process can be strengthened if small facilities are provided to meet the needs of local communities because they can then be owned by the local communities and promoted not only by the health board but by the local drugs task force. I regret the one and only primary facility available in Dublin for a long time as far as I can recall, did great damage to the efforts of local communities to provide local treatment facilities. However, the 40 such facilities now established by the health board with the support of the local drugs task forces across Dublin &ndash; a further nine are to be established this year &ndash; are making considerable progress. Nonetheless, I accept the point made by different Deputies on that issue.</P>
    <P>Regarding the final comment made by Deputy Rabbitte on the expenditure of the voted fund, the issue was raised in detail at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and I understand we must respond in due course to the issues raised, which we will do. However, it would be erroneous to assume that, because the money has not been drawn down, it is not committed. I am sure Deputy Rabbitte understands that any project which applied for funding and received notification it would receive it is entitled to have it provided on a draw down basis as required. One of the difficulties which has arisen is that the community structure is heavily involved in the local drugs task force and community structures in some areas were not as strong as they might have been. Some time was required to put in place the support needed to develop local initiatives, many of which Deputy Rabbitte would know. Another issue which hindered drawing down funds relates to the planning process whereby a number of infrastructures to be supported by the fund to which Deputy Rabbitte referred had to acquire planning permission and this sometimes created delays and difficulties. I am happy that, out of 230 projects funded under the original local drugs task force system, almost 200 are now drawing <Col N="1063" /> down funds, with the remainder very close to commencing operation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by Deputy Rabbitte that I should drive forward the process is one I take seriously. I will continue to push very hard to have local facilities put in place and, as requested by Members, for support through treatment and after care, which is where a person, having come through the treatment process, needs help and support to reintegrate into society and the workplace. I have on a number of occasions appealed to employers to be more helpful and forthcoming in allowing young people coming through that system to obtain jobs in industry, because it is an important part of the rehabilitation of young people who have been caught up in the misuse of drugs.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together. The overriding priority of the Government continues to be the earliest implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. We are working closely with the British Government and with the political parties in Northern Ireland to achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress has already been made in the implementation process and work is continuing. The Northern Ireland Act, which underpins in British legislation the constitutional, institutional, equality and human rights aspects of the Agreement, became law on 19 November last year. Yesterday, the Northern Ireland assembly approved the report of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the number and demarcation of Government Departments for the new Northern Ireland executive. The assembly also approved proposals relating to the North/South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the Civic Forum. Agreement has been reached on the six areas for the North-South implementation bodies and the six other areas for co-operation where existing bodies will be the appropriate mechanisms for such co-operation. The Patten Commission on the future of policing, the Crimi<Col N="1064" /> nal Justice Review and the International Commission on Decommissioning are continuing with their work.</P>
    <P>To establish the shadow executive, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, must issue the necessary Standing Orders which allow for the d'Hondt system to be triggered. D'Hondt, as stipulated in the Good Friday Agreement, is the system whereby seats on the executive are allocated to parties in proportion to the number of seats they hold in the assembly. The Secretary of State has identified 10 March as a target date by which time all the legislative arrangements necessary for the devolution of powers to Northern Ireland should be in place.</P>
    <P>Following the agreement reached on 18 December, officials from both Governments, in consultation as appropriate with the Northern parties, have been working intensively on the detailed legislative and other preparations necessary to ensure, as is required by the Agreement, that the implementation bodies are established and will function alongside all the other institutions as and from the appointed day.</P>
    <P>My meeting with the Secretary of State in Dublin was part of the ongoing series of meetings, both at official and political level, between the Governments and the political parties on the full implementation of the Agreement. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs was also present at that meeting. We reviewed the current situation regarding the formation of the shadow executive and decommissioning, and the comprehensive work that had been carried out on the administrative and legislative arrangements to give effect to the agreement reached on 18 December on the North-South implementation bodies and the areas for co-operation. We also discussed how both Governments could best move these issues forward.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some regret that, despite the sustained efforts of both Governments, it has not yet been possible to resolve the impasse over the formation of the shadow executive and decommissioning. Decommissioning was an essential part of the negotiations and an important element of the Agreement. Like all aspects, the provisions of the Agreement in this area must be implemented in full.</P>
    <P>The solution to the current impasse lies in the building of trust on both sides. Both Governments are working on ways in which the necessary confidence on both sides can be built. We are both in agreement that we cannot allow one issue to block progress on full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The resolution of the decommissioning issue lies in the Agreement itself. There are specific mechanisms and a specific framework for handling the issue. The independent International Commission on Decommissioning, chaired by General John de Chastelain, has a critical role to play in resolving this issue. He is working closely with all the relevant parties and has the confidence of both Governments. The appointment of <Col N="1065" /> Martin McGuinness as Sinn Féin's representative to the decommissioning commission was regarded by both Governments as a positive step.</P>
    <P>I am sure all sides of the House will join me in warmly welcoming the vote in the Northern Ireland assembly yesterday. The endorsement by such a large majority of the report of the First Minister, David Trimble, and Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon, represents a major step forward in the process of implementing the Agreement. It sets in motion the final steps towards the establishment of all the new institutions of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the institutions is critical to the success of the Agreement as a whole. In enabling the representatives of the different traditions to work together in partnership and common cause, they will be vital to the underpinning of the new beginning signalled in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>In the same vein, we will all welcome the meeting today for the first time at delegation level between the UUP and Sinn Féin. This meeting marks another step in the normalisation of politics in Northern Ireland. This is the kind of politics &ndash; the politics of dialogue and inclusion &ndash; the people voted for, North and South, on 22 May last year.</P>
    <P>We are now entering a critical period in the process of implementing the Agreement. The challenges facing us are undoubtedly difficult, but we must simply find the ways and means to overcome them. We have no choice. There can be no question of a return to the old ways of conflict and violence. The people of this island have voted emphatically for a new beginning. The Government is working intensively with the British Government and the parties to ensure that the will of the people is delivered in full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister, the Government and all concerned well as they enter into this next phase of the peace process. Given the agreement voted on yesterday in Belfast in relation to the numbers and the demarcation to which the Minister referred, will he agree that if decommissioning were to commence, everything would be in place? Will he agree that on this occasion a form of words cannot be found and we need decommissioning to commence? Is the Minister aware that a recent <i>Belfast Telegraph </i>poll showed that 83 per cent of the overall population believes the disarmament process should commence immediately? Will he agree it is a political necessity that decommissioning commences? Does he have any indication from Sinn Féin or others that the IRA has changed from its previous publicly stated position that it will never disarm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw the results of the poll which called for immediate decommissioning, and of course it would help the process if decommissioning occurred. I have said on a number of occasions that the resolution of this difficult issue lies in the building of trust between Sinn Féin and <Col N="1066" /> the UUP. We must continue to work with these parties to create the necessary confidence on both sides. Taking account of what the Deputy said about time being limited and the necessity to move forward with the implementation of the process in its totality based on the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, &ldquo;parking&rdquo; of the Agreement, as has been suggested, cannot assist this process.</P>
      <P>Both myself and the Minister of State, together with the Taoiseach, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, and her junior Ministers will spend most if not all our time between now and early March in constant contact with one another and in meetings with the various leaders of the parties making up the assembly. It is my intention to visit the North during the coming week, as part of a series of visits I have been making over the recent and not too recent past, where I will continue intensive talks with a number of individuals in the context of the issues the Deputy's question raises. I appreciate the Deputy's wish that we succeed in bringing about the end result this whole island requires, which is a permanent peace based on all the elements of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It may seem like semantics but playing on the word &ldquo;decommissioning&rdquo;, will the Minister agree that since Semtex, for example, has not been commissioned it can hardly be decommissioned, and that some progress made in handing over Semtex or other weapons must be made? It is not a question of finding a formulation of words, it a question of commencement of the decommissioning process. Nobody in this House expects the IRA or the loyalist paramilitaries to hand over all their Semtex and weapons next April. It is implicit in the Agreement that decommissioning should start somewhere along the way. Is the Minister satisfied that some formula can be found to allow Sinn Féin Ministers take their seats in the Executive by way of commencement of the decommissioning of weapons, Semtex, etc?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has had a number of meetings with Sinn Féin representatives where the issue of decommissioning has been extensively and intensively explored. Of course we would welcome any progress on decommissioning of any type of military hardware, be it guns or Semtex. Both have the capacity to maim and kill people and we want that completely taken out of the peace process. We want movement in this area sooner rather than later, but this problem will only be resolved by give and take on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mechanism for dealing with decommissioning &ndash; is General de Chastelain's International Commission on Decommissioning. It is important that we allow him to get on with the task. As I already indicated in the substantive part of my response to the Deputy's question, the general is working actively with Mr. Martin <Col N="1067" /> McGuinness and the representatives of the other parties to ensure that decommissioning takes place within the two year timeframe set out in the Agreement, but if decommissioning can be achieved over the coming weeks, then it is achieved sooner rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister talks about a hope or wish that decommissioning would be achieved in the next few weeks, I presume he is referring to a commencement, a possible gesture or even at a minimum a commitment by the IRA that it will reverse its previously stated position that it will never decommission. Will the Minister clarify which of those three options is the one to which he refers?</P>
      <P>Is he in a position to outline to the House the formula which the Taoiseach indicated to the House yesterday had been put forward by the Government for resolving this particular problem? Is he of the view that there can be no Executive established without Sinn Féin and, as a corollary to that, there can be no involvement by Sinn Féin in the Executive without movement on the decommissioning issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to see all the parties in the Executive. As I pointed out in the substantive part of my response to Deputy Mitchell's question, we want the d'Hondt system to operate. That clearly provides a mathematical calculation based on the number of seats obtained by each of the parties in the Assembly. We want that to happen sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>The option of self-destruction of arms by the paramilitaries themselves is included in the regulations agreed by the two Governments. It is open to the paramilitaries to avail of this option and it is one of the approaches which the International Commission on Decommissioning is exploring. I agree with the Deputy that it is an approach which has obvious potential given the sensitivities and difficulties which surround the decommissioning issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My question, which the Minister did not answer, is whether it is his view that the Executive may not be established without a Sinn Féin involvement in it and, as a corollary to that, that there can be no involvement by Sinn Féin in an Executive unless there is movement by the Republican movement on decommissioning. The other part of that question was whether movement implies a simple statement by the IRA that it is prepared to decommission in accordance with the Agreement or whether there is a requirement that decommissioning commence before Sinn Féin can be accepted into the Executive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The parameters of a solution to the issue for the various parties, including the two Governments, is to continue to press forward and to have the Agreement implemented according to the suggested timetable. In the light of the impasse on the formation of the Shadow Executive, it is difficult to be precise about a sequence for the period ahead. In response to questions on the same issue at Question Time on previous occasions, I stated the timetable for which we might hope. Our best thinking on the timetable would be as follows. In late February-March, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland issues the necessary standing orders to trigger the d'Hondt system. At the following meeting of the Assembly, presuming all goes well, the presiding officer appoints the members of the Shadow Executive. In approximately mid-March, Governments complete the necessary legislative and other preparations for the establishment of the implementation bodies, the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. In March-April, the Governments exchange letters notifying each other that all necessary arrangements are in place; the British-Irish Agreement enters into force; the North-South Ministerial Council, the implementation bodies, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference are formally established and full powers are devolved to the Assembly; and the Government makes declaration and triggers amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. In fairness to Deputy De Rossa, at this stage I regret that I cannot give a more definitive estimate for the likely date for the establishment of all the institutions, but I assure him that everything possible is being done to resolve the current impasse at the earliest possible moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in asking about the issue as opposed to the dates. Would the Minister agree that neither he nor I nor anybody in this House participating in Government would sit around the table with another party who had a private army and would he agree that we cannot ask others to do so? Is it not clearly implicit in the Good Friday Agreement, just as it was implicit that the commencement of prisoner releases would take place over the period concerned or that the human rights framework would be put in place, that the decommissioning process must be started &ndash; nobody is asking for it to be completed &ndash; before Sinn Féin takes its places in the Executive? Would the Minister agree that the best service we, in this House, can do is to stop fudging this issue and make it clear? We know it is a difficult issue for the republican movement and for some loyalists but, difficult as it may be, we cannot fudge it. There must be some commencement to decommissioning so that they <Col N="1069" /> show their bona fides and the Executive can be set up. Is that not the situation?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister answer the questions I asked? I appreciate the information he has put on the record but it is not a response to the questions I asked. Is the Government seeking a statement from the IRA, through Sinn Féin or otherwise, that they are prepared to decommission? Such a statement would be a reversal of statements made on three occasions that they do not intend ever to decommission. Would such a statement be sufficient to allow Sinn Féin representatives to become members of the Executive? Is that the minimum required and are there other stages in the process which must be gone through? The Minister may say he is not in a position to answer my second question, in which case he will not be prepared to go as far as the Taoiseach did in his article in <i>The Sunday Times. </i>Is it the Government's position that the Executive may not be formed unless Sinn Féin is part of it and that Sinn Féin may not be part of it unless there is decommissioning?</P>

      <P>There is no intended fudge. The Taoiseach dealt with this matter yesterday in considerable detail. There is no point in dealing with it again unless the Deputies insist on doing so. I would have no difficulty in that regard. The Taoiseach and I have always said that decommissioning must happen. There can be no place for weapons in a democratic and peaceful Ireland. That is the principle the Taoiseach was reflecting in his interview in <i>The Sunday Times. </i>We all stand by that principle. The issue is now one of timing and interpretation, of how we go from the present to a point where all guns and Semtex have gone and of what must happen as we proceed along that route. The Agreement gives the key role in that regard to the estimable General John de Chastelain.</P>
      <P>I make two final points. I agree totally with Séamus Mallon that only an inclusive solution will work. I heard him on the radio recently set out very clearly what was required, in his usual articulate and excellent manner. Second, it is only through the Agreement and its implementation that decommissioning will happen. It will not occur otherwise. It simply cannot occur otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell asked if the Minister or the Government would sit down with Sinn Féin in government here without decommissioning. That is a reasonable and appropriate question. However, it is a completely hypothetical question. It is the people who decide the composition of governments. I would, of course, only serve in government with those who are committed to <Col N="1070" /> peaceful and democratic means. In case of any doubt, I emphasise that Sinn Féin, under the leadership of Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness, has made a critical contribution to the search for peace and is committed to the full implementation of all the terms of the Agreement, including decommissioning.</P>
    <P>We must all be careful not to complicate further a very delicate issue at an extremely delicate time in the negotiations. In fairness, Deputy Gay Mitchell and Deputy De Rossa recognise that and I am appreciative. The task of the Government, the British Government and the leaders of all the political parties in Northern Ireland is not easy. The accommodation needed will be difficult all round. However, we must find an outcome with which everyone can live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for matters related to EU Structural Funds lies in the first instance with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council is responsible for co-ordination of the Agenda 2000 negotiations as a whole and for the preparation of an overall package to be presented for consideration by Heads of State or Government. In this context, the Department of Foreign Affairs performs a co-ordinating function, including through the work of the permanent representative to the European Union in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Vienna in December reiterated its firm commitment to reach overall agreement on Agenda 2000 at the European Council on 24 and 25 March of this year. A tight work programme has been agreed with a view to meeting that deadline. Foreign Ministers will meet in conclave to discuss Agenda 2000 on 21 February and again on 21 March. An informal meeting of Heads of State or Government will take place on 26 February in Bonn. The informal meeting of Foreign Ministers on 13/14 March is also likely to discuss Agenda 2000. The Agriculture Council and the ECOFIN Council will continue to discuss the relevant aspects of the package. Detailed discussions at official level will continue throughout this period.</P>
      <P>In addition to its co-ordinating function in respect of many of these meetings, the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to co-ordinate the preparation for various bilateral meetings at official and political level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> The Government will continue in the Agenda 2000 negotiations to press the case for a balanced and equitable outcome which takes full account of Ireland's concerns. As regards the Structural Funds, one aspect of central concern for us remains the need for adequate transitional arrangements for regions moving out of Objective One status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister's Department facilitate bilateral meetings only between his and other Departments or will meetings between Ministers and Secretaries General to examine Agenda 2000 be held on a collective basis? Can the Minister identify the critical issues of concern to Ireland in Agenda 2000 apart from the question of the Common Agricultural Policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a Ministers and Secretaries General committee which meets on a very regular basis. That is a combination of the leadership of the Taoiseach and the various Ministers involved in the negotiations together with the Secretaries General and officials of the various Departments. It has been meeting regularly with the view to a positive outcome to the negotiations. The negotiations are serious and the outcome appears less than generous from Ireland's point of view. I refer particularly to the Common Agricultural Policy proposals &ndash; CAP II &ndash; and Cohesion and Structural Funds. We are bound to tell the House that we are seized of the necessity to present a strong case on all three fronts to the various ministerial councils involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food will begin an open-ended meeting on Monday next which, hopefully, will conclude on Thursday, with his ministerial agricultural colleagues on the whole question of the Common Agricultural Policy. I am in close touch with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, in my co-ordinating role. We take these negotiations seriously. Given that I was involved in the previous negotiations with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in Edinburgh in 1992, I am aware of the need to keep in close contact with all the relevant Departments that have an input into the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Deputy's question as to what other than CAP are the main issues so far as Structural Funds are concerned, the problem is the suggestion that stability is the principle, in other words there will be no increase in the funds available as between 1992 and the present. In the context of the overall funding there is a considerable threat to Ireland's position. The problem as I, the Taoiseach, other Ministers and the civil servants involved see it, is that the Celtic tiger gives a false picture. In addition to many other problems the infrastructural development has been left far behind. We have to continue to emphasise we are an island off the mainland of Europe and that the <Col N="1073" /> needs in terms of Cohesion and Structural Funds are still very real. They have to take account of the lack of infrastructural development, environmental need and other issues which are extremely important.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental group on Agenda 2000 chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs was established in July 1997 to consider Ireland's overall strategy in relation to the Agenda 2000 negotiations and report to the Ministers and Secretaries General group on EU policy chaired by the Taoiseach. The interdepartmental group met regularly for that purpose until the Vienna-European Council on 11-12 December 1998. With a view to co-ordinating Ireland's approach in the decisive final phase of the negotiations, the Government decided in December 1998 to establish a Cabinet sub-committee on Agenda 2000 as well as an expert technical group to support that sub-committee, both of which are chaired by the Taoiseach. Informal co-ordination takes place on a day to day basis between the relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>Effectively, it is all systems go as far as Agenda 2000 negotiations are concerned. The Germans wish to bring the negotiations to a conclusion at the final Council meeting on 24-25 March. While that is what they are aiming for, it is not cast in stone. We are not seeking any special consideration apart from our entitlement as a member of the EU and we are not engaging in a process of pretence, with the begging bowl or the upturned hat, quite the contrary. We are there as an equal member of the European Union and we seek only equity and justice in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Presidency, under my colleague, Mr. Joscha Fischer, who is an understanding individual, seeks to advise countries such as Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece that their net contribution over the years has to be reduced. That is his negotiating position. Our negotiating position is otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister what he believes are the critical issues for Ireland, apart from the Common Agricultural Policy, not the critical issues relating to Structural Funds. It is clear from his reply that the Government sees this process as a means of extracting the greatest amount of money from the European Union. Does the Minister believe much damage has been done to Ireland's position in Europe as a result of the artificial manner in which two regions were created, which bear no relationship to real regions in Ireland, stretching from County Louth to south Kerry? It is seen simply as a grab for what will probably amount to less than £100 million over six or seven years in additional moneys. This has damaged Ireland's reputation as a member of the European Union. Will he indicate what other objectives the Government has in these negotiations, other than maximising the amount of money from the European Union? Does it have any objectives regarding the enlargement <Col N="1074" /> issue and the assistance which might be offered&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is the principal spokesman of an important democratic party and the sort of guff he has articulated and his attitude are less than helpful to our position in the run up to the Agenda 2000 negotiations. So far as our application to EUROSTAT for Objective One status for the 15 counties in the Border and western part of the country is concerned, it is an utterly important part of the negotiations. It is appropriate and I see nothing wrong with it, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes of ensuring Ireland is advantaged in the CAP negotiations is to maximise the benefits. The Deputy should ask the farmers who, I understand, are outside the House in their thousands, road users and those who drink water on a daily basis if they want all those services improved. The only way those services can be improved is through balanced detailed negotiations. At the end of the day it is all based on consensus and a positive outcome for all countries. That is legitimate and I see nothing wrong with that position.</P>
      <P>Given that we are coming to a critical phase in the negotiations, the interventions by Deputy De Rossa and the manner in which he made them are less than helpful. On the question of enlargement, Ireland wants to see the so-called central and eastern European countries come into the larger Union. It wants to see the five plus one countries, the so-called &ldquo;in&rdquo; countries, involved in the European Union in the year 2003-04. Account has been taken of that fact. We strongly support enlargement and the sharing of European finance that has been divvied out to the original members of the European club. We have no problem with further enlargement down the road; that is, the ins and the pre-ins, the ten plus one, plus possibly Turkey. We see that as part of a positive and peaceful future for the European continent. We have no problem with that.</P>

      <P>The British Foreign Secretary and I met with the President of the Commission on 25 January on the occasion of the General Affairs Council. The President of the Commission was accompanied by Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, the Commissioner responsible for regional policy.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cook and I had sought the meeting to underline the importance of continued EU support for the peace process and to set out some ideas in that regard. As the Deputy will be aware, the Cardiff European Council in June 1998 warmly welcomed the Good Friday Agreement, noted the Commission's commitment to go on finding new, creative ways to support the peace process and invited the Commission to make proposals accordingly. Those conclusions were reaffirmed by the Vienna European Council in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We took the occasion to express our appreciation to President Santer for the Commission's consistent support for the peace process in the past. The importance of maintaining an adequate level of structural funding in Northern Ireland was emphasised. I underlined, in particular, the <Col N="1076" /> importance of building on the current cross-community and cross-Border initiatives such as INTERREG, the Peace and Reconciliation Programme and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister subsequently wrote to President Santer developing our joint thinking in the matter. Moreover, Mr. Trimble and Mr. Mallon have also reiterated to President Santer the importance of continued EU support and have set out their shared thinking in that regard.</P>
    <P>The support of the European Commission, the European Parliament and all our EU partners for the peace process has been very significant and deeply appreciated. The Commission is currently reflecting on the points which have been made. I have no doubt that the situation in Northern Ireland will be recognised by specific and generous treatment in the context of Agenda 2000 and beyond.</P>

      <P>Given the day that is in it and the decision announced by the Commission, why did the Minister not seek to raise the question of duty free sales with the President of the Commission? Given the Government's stated position that this is a priority for it and the impression given by the Minister for Public Enterprise &ndash; one would think they were storming heaven in this regard &ndash; why did the Minister not raise the duty free campaign?</P>
      <P>Did the Minister raise with the President, or did the President raise with him, the matter of accountability of European Commissioners, given what happened in the European Parliament and the views expressed by the Parliament on the need for Commissioners to be more accountable? Specifically, did the position of Commissioner Flynn and the domestic controversy surrounding him come up in discussion? If so, in what context did it arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not raise the issue of duty free on the occasion I met with President Santer and Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, who is the Commissioner responsible for regional policy. My mind was set on one message, which related to the peace process in Northern Ireland. I did not think it was appropriate to raise the matter of duty free at that time.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about the duty free issue because it is a nonsense to abolish it. I have expressed that personal position in the past. Wiping out thousands of jobs at the stroke of a pen flies in the face of what we are preaching about the number of people unemployed in the EU. However, that is just my personal point of view. In reply to the Deputy's question, I did not raise the matter of duty free because I left that matter entirely for the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to deal with in her very capable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the accountability of the EU Commission, given that we were looking for something for the North of Ireland, it would have been impractical to raise with the President of the <Col N="1077" /> Commission and his colleague, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, their appearance before the European Parliament. That would have been inappropriate on the basis that Mr. Cook and I sought the meeting to discuss the peace process.</P>
    <P>The matter of Commissioner Flynn was dealt with by the House last week. To answer Deputy Mitchell frankly, I did not mention him one way or the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's suggestion that the regions are invented. They are nothing of the kind. There is a legitimate application before EUROSTAT in relation to these regions, one of which is for Objective One in transition and the other is Objective One. This application should be supported. It is an utterly legitimate request and nobody has said otherwise, other than the observations made by Deputies Mitchell and De Rossa.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cook and I sought the meeting to underline the importance of continued EU support for the peace process and to set out some ideas in that regard. We met with President Jacques Santer, who has been hugely helpful to the North and South of Ireland since he became President and is very positive in response to requests made to him on any matter. He has been particularly helpful to the peace process, in terms of the funding of INTERREG, the Peace and Reconciliation Programme and the International Fund for Ireland. I did not mention these matters at that meeting. However, I wish to put on the record our continued appreciation of his interest in that and other matters.</P>

      <P>Before the debate adjourned, I asked who would police the police state? That is what we will have in the new powers conferred on the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of <Col N="1079" /> Social, Community and Family Affairs. It will create serious problems for many people.</P>
      <P>Families are being attacked once again with the increase in VRT on small saloon cars. The Minister was unable to look after the family man who needs a car to bring his children to school or to travel to church or work. When Ireland joined the EU, we expected to be able to buy cars at the same price as other European citizens. Instead, successive Governments have used the car industry to raise revenue. The recent budget offered an opportunity to leave the car industry and the family man alone. It is disgraceful that such an attack was made on ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The Minister looked after his friends in the racing fraternity. We see millionaires and billionaires travelling by helicopter to the Phoenix Park to place £500,000 bets. I know he likes a little flutter and likes to attend race meetings, as do many other Ministers but they would be far better off if they went out to meet the common people and listened to their problems and fears. VRT will affect many families.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed the recent budget did not contain any major initiative to address the serious housing crisis. Details of urban renewal schemes will be announced today and I am delighted that Ballina will be included. I am very disappointed that my own home town, Westport, is not included but was delighted I was able to achieve its inclusion when Fine Gael was in Government. Westport is paying a price for not having a TD in Government. People in Swinford, Ballyhaunis and Kiltimagh will be very disappointed that their towns are not included in the scheme. I will highlight that issue and inform the people that they have been let down once again by this Government. They are becoming accustomed to it. They have been let down time and time again.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Ring agus a chomhleacaí as Fine Gael as ucht a gcuid ama a roinnt liom. Ba mhaith liom cúpla rud a rá faoin mBille Airgeadais; tosóidh mé leis an bunphointe. I listened carefully to the Minister's Second Stage speech. He boasted that the budget and the Finance Bill were fair, reasonable, balanced and well thought out. However, the widening gap between rich and poor remains unchallenged. The situation which has been highlighted by many agencies, not least by the ESRI, demonstrates that the gap is a very real one. According to the ESRI, between 1995 and 1998, the richest 10 per cent gained 4 per cent over and above the simple indexation rule while the poorest 30 per cent gained 2 per cent less than that from various social welfare increases. The ESRI also points out that over the past four years social welfare rates have increased by 16 per cent whereas incomes have risen by 22 per cent. There is clearly a section of society which feels very left out. If the Government is serious about being a Government for all the people, there is some ground to be made up and a need to establish a <Col N="1080" /> more equitable system. Having done that, it would be necessary to ensure that progress from that point on would be sustainable.</P>
      <P>Today on the Order of Business, I raised the issue of the lack of sustainability in our general economic activity. That will land us in serious trouble because of our obligations and also because of wider unsustainability factors.</P>
      <P>The Minister has introduced legislation on the Bretton Woods Agreement. I do not believe that legislation is necessary at this point. Previous Governments have resisted signing up to that economic straitjacket. I am glad to see the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, in the House as I am aware she has a keen interest in this area and in the economic systems of other countries. Apart from our country which is not receiving due attention in terms of equity and equal treatment for all citizens, we are now exporting inequality through our support for the IMF, as expressed in the Bretton Woods legislation. We have got ourselves into a situation from which this Government does not seem willing &ndash; whatever about capable &ndash; to get out.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill refers to the drift to urban centres. However, the radical changes required to address that are not in the Bill. The Minister referred to the rural renewal provisions in section 41. They fall far short of what people outside of this House would expect from someone serious about rural renewal. Rural Resettlement Ireland &ndash; an organisation for which I have a great deal of respect &ndash; is constantly crying out for funding and support but that support is not forthcoming. Talking about rural renewal reliefs in terms of revenue falls short of the job which must be done; it gives rise to expectations but does not follow through on them.</P>
      <P>On section 11, the Minister stated that employment of a carer will now extend to the hire of a carer through an agency. He has recognised to some extent the huge volume of work being done in this society on a voluntary basis. Carers are currently experiencing a very difficult time, as they always will because of the nature of their situation. I hope the Government will alleviate the huge burden of work placed on them, if only because they are saving the State an enormous amount of money by avoiding the cost of institutional care for the people being cared for.</P>
      <P>The child care provisions outlined in section 11 are principally considered in the context of people in full-time employment. This has given rise to enormous anger among people who stay at home to look after their children. They do not feel valued. I am sure the Minister has seen the letters in the newspapers to that effect. They feel even less valued when child care is dealt with almost exclusively in terms of people in full-time employment. Some people who stay at home to look after their children probably give up many career opportunities and do not wish to be excluded from the child care provisions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> Section 16 refers to tightening up relevant contracts tax whereby tax is deducted at source in the case of certain subcontractors in the construction, meat processing and forestry industries. I wonder if such tightening up of the tax system will squeeze the largesse of some of the larger contributors to some of the political parties in this House. We will know that when we will see how it will affect contributions to political parties. Through the Freedom of Information Act and other ways, I look forward to finding out what effect this measure will have.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that an individual will have a greater role in the investment of accumulating funds during the contribution period, but it does not refer specifically to ethical investment. In light of revelations concerning financial institutions, increasingly people will want to know where their money is being invested and the ethical use to which it is being put. There are many institutions dealing in unsavoury activities. I mentioned the arms industry. The organisation promoting investment in Britain states there is no need to set up trade unions as it is possible to get away with paying staff reasonably low wages.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the minimum period of the lease of properties eligible for section 23 type allowances will be reduced from one year to three months. If this provision is designed to adequately deal with problems in the housing sector, it falls far short of what is required. It also falls far short of dealing with problems in the rental sector. It is time these problems were addressed. There is a lack of monitoring of rental income. Landlords are required to register, but vast numbers of them are not registered. At one time I assessed that the owners of 80 per cent of rented accommodation were not registered, yet rental allowances from the health boards, which is public money, makes up some of the rental income of some of those landlords. Such income must be monitored by enforcing the rules governing this sector.</P>
    <P>Section 63 provides 100 per cent capital allowances for the provision of park and ride facilities. This has been extended to allow for commercial and residential development. It will tempt large contractors, who want to promote out of town shopping, to avail of this provision, but the Minister should not allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>Sections 75 and 76 refers to tax measures to eradicate undesirable exploitation and they relate to non-residential tax structures, but they are being circumvented. The Bacon report allows for investment outside this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to what is undoubtedly the most radical and reforming <Col N="1082" /> budget we have had in many a day. Even the most visionary commentators would not have thought last year that the Minister for Finance would introduce such radical change, particularly in the income tax system by the introduction of a tax credits system.</P>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to a number of issues, the first of which relates to provisions which will affect older people. The £6 per week increase in pension benefit, plus the £3 increase for qualified adult dependants is extremely welcome. The provision for extra beneficiaries of the fuel allowance has also been greatly welcomed. The income taxation limits for persons aged 65 and over has been increased by 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are major improvements in the guidelines for medical cards for people over 70 and the increase, particularly for those in the older age bracket, has been widely welcomed. A married couple aged 70 to 79 years can have a weekly income of approximately £179. Many pensioners, who were excluded from eligibility to a medical card up to now because they were in receipt of occupational pensions, will be able to benefit from one from 1 March. That is an important social inclusion measure in this year which has been designated as the international year for older people.</P>
      <P>This Bill will give effect to the budgetary proposal that the income tax limits for those aged between 65 and 74 years of age be increased by 30 per cent from £3,000 to £13,000 for a married couple and by £1,500 to £6,500 for a single or widowed person. For those aged 75 or over exemption limits have been raised by 18 per cent to £13,000 for a married couple and to £6,500 for a single or a widowed person.</P>
      <P>Another welcome provision is that of capital allowance to encourage investment in private convalescent facilities. There is a shortage of nursing home care and of step down care facilities. This provision is extremely welcome and will encourage the provision of more bed places which can be made available to the various health boards.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's grant scheme has been reformed and improved. I have asked various Ministers to do this down through the years and I compliment the Minister on doing it now. I compliment, in particular, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, for dramatically increasing the level of the grant to £12,000 for a house extension for a disabled person. That budgetary provision has made a great difference to many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about urban renewal. I was delighted to learn from the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, today that the areas, for which Dublin Corporation sought tax designation following their submission of integrated area plans, will receive residential incentives initially which will apply for a three year period from 1 March. This scheme will transform the centre of Dublin city in particular. The Government has committed approximately £180 million to rejuvenate the <Col N="1083" /> 2,500 housing units in the Ballymun area. This is the largest urban renewal project in Europe. The next largest one is the rejuvenation of Beirut, which is also being carried out by a Dublin architect. I compliment Danny O'Hare, chairman of Ballymun Rejuvenation Limited, its board and the Ballymun community for the way they responded to the consultative process.</P>
    <P>The heritage rejuvenation project around the Smithfield area which stretches to Collins Barracks is also welcome. The old Inchicore-Kilmainham area will also be transformed, as will the Liberties and the Coombe and the north east inner city. We look forward to the transformation of the main boulevard in this city, stretching from Parnell Street to O'Connell Bridge, under the O'Connell Street millennium project.</P>
    <P>Another sector of beneficiaries is younger people. The reform of the income tax system will benefit first time earners. For the first time in years they will have much more money in their pockets.</P>
    <P>Section 23 relief is extended for a limited period to cover the conversion, construction and refurbishment of residences for third level students. I expect Dublin City University, which is in my constituency, will avail of this. On capital allowances for buildings used in third level education, I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, for their vision in introducing the provision whereby 50 per cent of funds are provided by the public sector which will also be able to avail of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Employees who receive travel passes from employers are liable to income tax on the value of the benefit. The Finance Bill will exempt employees from taxation on travel passes provided by employers where the passes are valid for a period of one month or longer. This is an excellent provision and certainly will help the traffic congestion problem which bedevils the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent referred to section 63 which provides a 100 per cent capital allowance for the establishment of park and ride facilities in the larger urban areas to help alleviate traffic congestion. It is an excellent provision. My big concern about park and ride facilities was that we would end up with rather bleak, grey, multi-storey car parks surrounded by almost desert conditions. However, I am glad the Minister has responded to representations which will allow commercial and, more importantly, residential developments to be associated with park and ride facilities, subject to the residential element of any project not exceeding 25 per cent of the total allowable expenditure and the residential and commercial elements combined not exceeding 50 per cent of that expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill includes many more provisions which I welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Carey for sharing his time. The budget is quite remarkable and it <Col N="1084" /> has not been properly or appropriately recognised. It is visionary and has brought real tax equity for the first time. We are beginning to put in place major tax changes. Tax reliefs amounting to £581 million are the best news ever for personal taxpayers. Taking 82,000 taxpayers at the bottom of the scale out of the net is a real sign of progress. This being the case, I do not recognise the macabresque version of events set out by Deputy Sargent. It seems the Deputy has not read the Budget Statement and certainly has not read the same papers I have.</P>
      <P>There are so many measures in the budget, that in the short time available one can only dwell on a few. In addition to the positive measures on personal taxation there is a series of innovations, some of which have been mentioned in the debate and which deserve recognition. I welcome the tax relief improvements introduced by the Minister in the creation of the scientific and technological education investment fund. This will provide very valuable additional capital investment in the education sector. It is a use of the tax system which we have failed to grasp over the years. For a country which has introduced a vast array of tax breaks for a variety of causes, some good, some bad and some indifferent, it is amazing that it is only in recent times we have begun to really focus on the issue of tax breaks, third level education and the entire education sector. The decision made by the Minister to which the Bill will give effect will be regarded in future as prudent, timely and far sighted.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the tax inducements to improve the situation pertaining to student accommodation. As a parent and somebody involved in third level education, I have been increasingly alarmed in recent years at the crisis in accommodation for third level students. There has been a major crisis in this area which has grown over the past five or six years. It is a major problem for families and students and I welcome the provisions being introduced by the Minister. In the recent past some creative uses have been made of the tax system, for example, the creation of the student villages in UCD which are a remarkable use of land and which showed an ingenious adaptation of the tax system. The general extension of section 23 reliefs to cover the construction and conversion of accommodation for student use on or close to campuses is very welcome and one which will have a major impact in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I hope the third level colleges will use the certification role they are identified as playing as a pro-active way of levering investment in the vicinity of third level colleges. In particular I mention some of the smaller towns and cities where the institutes of technology are based. This provision will be tremendously beneficial in Carlow, for example, and I hope to see major initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also worth pointing out that students, parents and accommodation providers will not be the only beneficiaries of this measure, as the accommodation created under this measure will not be <Col N="1085" /> in use as student accommodation during June, July and August when it can be turned to other uses. For example, it can be used in the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey touched on the remarkable things happening in Ballymun. Ballymun is very close to DCU and there are a huge number of potential student accommodation units in some of the tower blocks. In this context it is a bit of a pity that we have decided on total destruction rather than conversion. However, that is a matter for Deputies from the area.</P>
    <P>Another important measure which I welcome is the roll over of the existing tax relief for the film industry. I live within yards of Ardmore Studios and I represent County Wicklow, Ireland's premier location for film production, where the local authority has put its money where its mouth is by creating a very innovative film commission. I welcome this measure. However, I ask the Minister to consider another taxation measure, perhaps not this year but in the years ahead, namely, a tax break to assist studios and production companies to protect Ireland's film heritage. We have established quite a unique production record dating to the 1920s. Yet there is no measure in place to protect some of this unique heritage. It would be a major attraction in towns such as Bray, for example, if sets and props of films such as Braveheart, Excaliber and the Blue Max were protected rather than torn down, burned and dispersed. Perhaps the Minister will examine this matter in the next budget.</P>
    <P>The decisions on urban renewal are very welcome. However, I remind the Minister, and will again if I get a chance to speak on Committee Stage, that he and I share a common interest in the seasides' resort scheme. It was due to be reviewed and the review was supposed to be published in the middle or at the end of last summer. To date the Department has been silent on the issue. The Minister and I when in Opposition pressed the case for Bray. Bray is unique, being Ireland's first seaside resort. We were looking for designation of a very narrow strip along the Victorian sea front. That did not come, not because the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, did not reckon the value of seaside resort status for Bray &ndash; he did, and he said as much in the Seanad &ndash; but because Deputy McManus, then a Minister of State, did not push the issue. That was a fundamental error. Bray is suffering and I ask the Minister when the seaside resort examination has been completed, to consider sympathetically the phrases he used in Opposition. Certainly, I will remind him of what he said, and I am sure Opposition Deputies will do likewise.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the seafarers' allowance. That was something for which I had looked for years. We have had a problem as an island nation in that we have not been able to attract young men and women into the seafaring life. The provision of the £5,000 tax free allowance for seafarers who are away for 169 days is welcome. I question the stipulation of 169 days, but one cannot have <Col N="1086" /> everything. This is something for which the seafaring unions and certainly the shipping companies have looked for some time. I am delighted the Minister has introduced the measure.</P>
    <P>I would like to inject a little realism into my contribution because I do not want simply to welcome sycophantically everything the Minister has done. There are two issues on which I ask the Minister to pause a little. One of the issues is the VRT measures. I understand fully that the Minister has said &ndash; it is a defensible position &ndash; that he wants to do something about larger motor vehicles, which are problematic in terms of emissions and the environment. I suggest to the Minister that his advisers in this regard might be looking in the wrong direction. It is my belief that if the issue to be addressed here is not revenue, which we are assured it is not, but in fact a reduction in pollution, a more proactive role can be played by the Department and by the tax system in future years by attempting to move the population as a whole, in particular fleet owners and specifically heavy fleet owners, to LPG.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland ignore variations in the prices of petrol. As Deputy Durkan travels in from that beautiful part of County Kildare he will pass ten separate petrol stations and each one, I guarantee him, has a variation of 1p or 2p per litre on prices. People are remarkably price ignorant in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Minister put 1p on the more environmentally friendly levels of fuel and 2p on the environmentally unfriendly ones, he could have created a fund out of which he could have put a tax inducement to every motorist and fleet operator to move from petrol and diesel to LPG. I mention, in particular, bus fleets. It is extraordinary that Bus Éireann is in the process of rebuilding a fleet with the taxpayers' money which will be driven by fossil fuels other than LPG. It is bizarre.</P>
      <P>My other point relates to what I described elsewhere as the nuclear option, that is, the changes the Minister is making in the Bill as regards significant new powers for the Revenue Commissioners, including greater powers of access to information held in financial institutions. In a sense, it is either a foolhardy or a brave political representative who would stand up in the current climate and suggest that maybe we might be going a little far, but I will put my toe into this shark infested water. I suggest to the Minister that this is something we need to consider very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the basis on which the tax advisers in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have indicated to the Minister that we must adopt not only a proactive but a blitzkrieg attitude to the corporate culture in the State which tolerates tax abuse. I have no <Col N="1087" /> time whatsoever nor remit for those involved in exploiting legal, taxation and accounting skills to dodge tax. My view is that if everybody in this country paid their fair share of tax, those of us who are tax compliant would pay a hell of a lot less.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned that we may be going somewhat over the top here. I strongly believe these measures, to some degree, are necessary. Perhaps what has happened, however, is that the Revenue Commissioners having been caught in the spotlight by recent revelations are now advising the Minister to go for a series of options which make sure they are never caught in the spotlight again. I would want to be assured that these measures will not cause hardship and cause decent law abiding citizens, who are by and large tax compliant, any difficulties. I would always support the fullest possible measures against tax evasion and the crooked corporate culture which has grown up in this nation in recent years.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned at the matter in which the new powers can be deployed. I accept the Minister's view that law abiding compliant taxpayers should have nothing to fear from the use of the powers, and I accept that is the Minister's intention and that of his advisers. When introducing extraordinary measures, however, one must also introduce some type of safeguard or cooling off process &ndash; a process to ensure there is not over-vigour. I ask the Minister, particularly in the context of Committee Stage considerations, to consider what protections are needed.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, this is a very fine Bill and it was a fantastic budget. It does not surprise me in the least that the Bill and budget were excellent because that is what I would have expected from an excellent Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill. I compliment the Minister and the Government on the Bill and on giving effect to a very innovative budget. There are three issues on which I wish to speak. The first relates to the budget as regards rural Ireland. Over the years my area of Duhallow, in particular, has seen a decline in population and a haemorrhage to larger urban areas. The buzz words in Europe and among various Government bodies are &ldquo;rural decline&rdquo; and the need to do something about it. Nearly every expert is talking about rural decline and various reports have been compiled and commissions set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important industries in rural Ireland is the agriculture industry which has gone through hell on earth in 1998 and previously as a result of prices and weather conditions. Before the budget, the Government said moneys would be made available for the restoration of three on-farm investment grants, and it was also mentioned in the budget speech. I refer to the control of farmyard pollution, dairy hygiene and installation aid schemes. I know there will be a full debate on CAP reform and Agenda 2000 tomor<Col N="1088" /> row and I will leave my detailed remarks until then. The Government must ensure that places like my native Duhallow are able to rely on the traditional industry. The necessary tax incentives or measures to rejuvenate that industry should be introduced.</P>
    <P>Looking back to 1986 or 1987, which was around the time I completed my leaving certificate, many people were leaving school and going straight on to the emigrant ships to Britain, which was booming at the time, or to America. Few people would have said that in ten or 11 years Ireland would be booming and would be able to provide employment for all its people. We should look at the way we have turned the economy around over the past ten years because we now have an industry which is in decline and under severe pressure. Like it or not, it is no longer a trendy industry into which people go with the encouragement of their families or the institutions of State. The industry can be turned around provided there is the will to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax reforms in the budget and the Finance Bill. For too long, we have heard that it paid people not to work but we have turned the system around and there is an incentive for people to work. They are being rewarded for their work, which I welcome. It is right to encourage people to work.</P>
    <P>The town of Kanturk in my area has a tag, whether flattering or otherwise, as being the oldest town in Ireland, meaning that it has the oldest population. That is as a result of constant depopulation and the drain of young people from the area. The Government is committed to allocating moneys to provide services at the local district hospital. The initiative on nursing homes and disabled persons' grants is welcome. Judging from the statistics, there will be an enormous demand for additional care facilities.</P>
    <P>A tax break has been announced for employers who supply their employees with bus passes, which will not be treated as benefit-in-kind. This will be of benefit mainly to employers in urban areas. Employers in rural areas &ndash; I have specific companies in mind &ndash; who provide a bus service for their employees should be able to avail of a similar incentive.</P>
    <P>The application of the urban renewal scheme to small towns with a population of 6,000 and more has been mentioned. I welcome the initiative of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to extend the townscape restoration scheme to smaller towns. The biggest town in my constituency of Cork North West is Charleville which has a population of just over 2,000. This initiative should lead to their rejuvenation with the retention of services and the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>A tax incentive scheme has been announced for the upper Shannon region. There are many other areas, including Duhallow in my constituency, which would welcome the opportunity to be included in the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget had many good features on which many Deputies will concentrate. There were, however, significant omissions and failures. In discussing a Finance Bill one is discussing what is planned for the economy; it is not simply a tax administration or consolidation matter, it is an expression of economic policy.</P>
      <P>The economy has recorded historic growth in double figures, interest rates are low and unemployment is decreasing but how has the Bill addressed the issue of inequality? The gaps between the five quintiles in terms of incomes have widened. To what extent has the Bill addressed those who are excluded? How has it addressed the issue of the low paid, of which there are many in the Department of Finance? It is not stated sufficiently that there is a small army of staff who are badly paid in the lower grades of the public service. They have received minuscule rises compared to the arrangements made for those on higher salaries.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance adopts an extraordinarily provocative attitude in resolving disputes, from the Botanic Gardens, the museums, Collins Barracks to Údarás Na Gaeltachta, in relation to gradings, salaries and increases in staff numbers. Ministers and Ministers of State often find themselves in a position where they cannot solve disputes which are resolvable on the basis of good industrial relations. These are issues of management within the Department. The suggestion was floated at one stage that the Secretary General of a Department should be able to reach over the head of the respective Minister or Minister or State and deal directly with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance. That would have resulted in a significant erosion of the power of Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>The double digit growth of the economy can be traced to the expenditure of Structural Funds, high capital investment, a highly educated workforce and a fall in unemployment. If this is to be sustained at a time when there are shortages in significant areas of the workforce, capital investment in infrastructure will have to increase. I would place a question mark beside the figure advised by the Department of Finance to the Minister as to what is the appropriate level. This is not just my opinion but that of conservative economists.</P>
      <P>Housing is our most serious problem and it is clear that one cannot solve this issue through a set of taxation measures on the supply side. There is a need for specific short-term and long-term allocations. Short-term assistance should go to those affected by the crisis in the rental sector where special allocations could have been made to organisations such as Threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incomprehensible that the Minister is not <Col N="1090" /> accepting the general thrust of the findings of the working group on credit unions. The only dissenting voice to changes in the tax regime which would favour credit unions came from the Department of Finance's representative on the working group. The Minister would have the support of all sides of the House if he accepted the qualitative difference between credit unions and the banking sector. I do not want to be drawn into more controversial areas, but one bank has reported an extraordinary level of profits. Such results have an immediate effect on shares. Therefore, owning shares in a bank means owning an asset.</P>
    <P>Credit unions which are doing well do not have such assets in terms of shares. They are founded on a completely different philosophy. When the Minister is advised by officials in the Department of Finance that there is no need to treat credit unions more favourably than at present, he is missing the point as to the philosophy, basis, function and nature of deposits in credit unions, and the qualitative difference between such deposits and money lodged in banks or held in shares. I am deeply disappointed by the Bill on this issue. The Minister may wish to return to this matter but my views are shared by all sides of the House. He should take action on this issue and listen to proposals which may arise on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to two other extraordinary matters. The Bill's provisions concerning the film industry are appalling. The Minister is reflecting what was written for him but in his speech he stated that he hoped the clarification will calm matters in the film sector. I assure him his speech will not do so. When I was Minister with responsibility for film, it was clear that anyone planning investment in film, even a low-budget film, needed a minimum of 18 months to put a financial package together. Ideally one needed at least three years so that one could move from one project to another. It is impossible to put film finance together within one year. Under pressure from the Department of Finance, the rate was reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent, but the compensation was that the scheme would be in place for three years. That proved to be the case from 1996 to 1999.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that those who are unsympathetic to film have succeeded in dislodging the Minister. Between 1993 and 1996 when I changed the scheme the results were there. However, I noticed the Department of Finance had a jaundiced eye when it came to film. In 1993, 16 feature films were made in Ireland; in 1994 the figure was 18; in 1995 it was 27; in 1996 it was 25 and it rolled on. Other independent productions increased from 43 in 1994 to 95 in 1996.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the Irish spend from the film industry was £44.8 million; in 1995 it was £73.9 million; in 1996 it was £53.2 million and in 1997 it was £78.7 million. The industry was growing in terms of spend. In 1997, £46.1 million was sought in tax relief, yet the Irish spend in that year was £78.7 million. In 1996, £30.3 million was sought in tax <Col N="1091" /> relief while the spend was £53.2 million. In 1995-96, the tax relief sought was £42.9 million while the spend was £73.9 million. Whatever one was granting by way of tax relief one was more than getting it back in the value of spend and the employment generated.</P>
    <P>The excuse now being offered is that the INDECON report, which favours extending the relief, has to be reviewed. However, that report was carried out some time ago. The report of the industry group established by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, has been available for some time, as have other reports. Deputy de Valera stated in an answer to a Dáil question that we could expect the industry's future to be outlined in the Minister's Budget Statement. However, that statement was silent on film, as were the heads of the Finance Bill. The only reference in the Bill is to a one-year extension which sends the wrong impression abroad just as the film industry is expanding.</P>
    <P>If the extension was to be for one year under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, previously section 35, one would need to explicitly state that this scheme is being replaced by one which will run for three, five or ten years. When I was Minister, Deputy de Valera stated she wanted a long-term strategy for five or ten years. I support that view but where is such a provision in this Bill? There is a 12-month extension which is useless in terms of being competitive internationally on financing and securing funding. This is very dispiriting, not just for the film community. We should remember that in 1996, 95 independent television productions were completed. Huge numbers of people are involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>There is also complete silence on the adequate funding of the training module. The reports are there and by Committee Stage I hope the Minister will be provoked into giving details of what scheme the Department has in mind to replace section 481. The Department of Finance must overcome its prejudice towards film and cultural industries in general. Its attitude seems to be that if this was worthwhile it would have been done years ago by the IDA or someone else. I perceived this hostility. It is time the Department got over its prejudice as there are millions of pounds in income and many jobs at stake.</P>
    <P>At least two reports were published before I left office which suggested the employment potential of the music industry. Three years ago that industry was worth a minimum of £250 million per year in exports. Far more importantly in terms of job creation, there were young bands who wanted to see an expansion of the BES to recording. They wanted facilities provided for the distribution of music. There is no need to wait for a report because two are already available. One was produced by the music industry and the other report on the economic potential of the music industry was commissioned. However, there was <Col N="1092" /> not one word about the potential of this area in the Minister's speech. It is most important to consider how jobs can be created in this area if we wish to do so. A report on film training needs up to the year 2000 was delayed for approximately a year for the want of less than £500,000. As a result, training modules could not be set up. This is outrageous.</P>
    <P>My unusual opinion is not necessarily shared by members of my party but the conservative view of the management of finances, irrespective of economic implications, that has emerged from the Department of Finance is working against the development of a modern economy. I have always been in favour of allocations to Departments which could be used with discretion in an accountable manner on a multi-annual basis in terms of the construction of the budget. However, a greyness is creeping in. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is about to go to the United States to announce a screen commission. She will talk about Ireland competing internationally in film making and distribution. However, she will also have to explain that there was a scheme which was an extraordinary success and people from all over the world considered it. It was run in three year modules but it is now contracted to 12 months. How could anybody who understood the industry think in those terms? It is a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to return on Committee Stage to the issues of specific measures in relation to housing, the need to address the report of the working group in a positive manner in relation to credit unions, the issue of low pay, the negative influence in terms of Ministers not being allowed to solve disputes about gradings and the disposal of staff in their Departments, the failures in relation to film and the failure to mention music at all. I hope the Minister will be his own man in being political about these matters. It is the political economy which matters, not the negative and badly informed type of thinking which is being offered to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>A survey carried out by a newspaper at the most recent Fianna Fáil Party Ard-Fheis showed that the most popular candidate as next leader of that party was the Minister for Finance. I wonder if his current standing owes something to his major U-turns throughout his political career and as Minister for Finance in recent years, particularly in relation to the introduction of tax credits. Under pressure from the Labour Party in particular, the Minister has made a small start along the road towards a much fairer distribution of taxation for employees and also in his new measures directed against criminal tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to overall macro-economic policy, the Government appears to have no interest whatsoever in the low levels of income which much of the population must endure. Recently I raised the problem of adult dependants on unemployment assistance and other social benefits with <Col N="1093" /> the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. According to the recent budget, which is copperfastened by the Finance Bill, these people receive the princely sum of £43 a week on which to live. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats have no interest in the topic of income adequacy and whether tens of thousands of people and their children have the basic wherewithal to live.</P>
    <P>The total social welfare budget amounts to £5 billion compared to a GDP of £50 billion. A third of our countrymen and women must exist on less than 10 per cent of the national income. Unlike much of the Finance Bill, they have no recourse to schemes. The Fianna Fáil Party made categorical promises during the last election in 1997 to consider basic income. However, over the past two years it has thrown the matter around like a hot potato and everybody has been anxious not to have anything to do with it.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem of the low income levels of many people must be addressed. As my colleague Deputy Higgins said, it is essential that another of the Government's election promises regarding a minimum wage is implemented on 1 April 2000 at the latest. There must not be another cavalier abandonment of an election promise.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to section 26 of the Social Welfare Bill, which is an extraordinary provision. Under this section, the police and social welfare inspectors will be empowered to stop vehicles to check on social welfare fraud. My party is bitterly opposed to any type of fraud, including social welfare fraud and tax evasion, but that provision is a ludicrous, over the top approach by the Government. This is why I welcome sections 189 and 190 where the Minister for Finance at last begins, in the face of his earlier pronouncements and those of his party and the Progressive Democrats, to take basic measures against the massive level of tax evasion.</P>
    <P>As I noted when I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts in the previous Dáil, at the outside social welfare fraud year on year amounts to approximately 0.5 per cent of the total budget. However, according to studies in Linz University in Austria and elsewhere, tax evasion could amount to up to 10 per cent of our GDP or at least £5 billion, which is the same size as our entire social welfare budget. I am glad there is a sense of proportion in this area. When the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Quinn, was Minister for Finance, he introduced section 153 to try to make accountants and lawyers accountable with regard to tax compliance. There was much screaming from the Opposition benches at the time, particularly from the Progressive Democrats who were bitterly opposed to the measure. Many elements of the Fianna Fáil Party said the world would collapse if that modest measure in relation to tax compliance was adopted.</P>
    <P>Sections 189 and 190 of the Bill are long overdue and will give a basis in this area. However, I <Col N="1094" /> do not understand the Minister's comments on those sections. He referred to a judicial review of the powers of the three Revenue Commissioners. To what extent will the new powers work in practice in relation to events such as those in recent years, some of which are now the subject of tribunals of inquiry?</P>
    <P>The limited overall budget strategy adopted by the Minister for Finance is reflected in the Finance Bill. He projects a 2.5 per cent increase each year in the health budget. However, it is obvious that he will use the increase in the health levy to cut back on this budget. While in Private Members' time we are appraising the disastrous failures of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, it must be stated that the Minister for Finance is also to blame for the current health and waiting lists crises.</P>
    <P>There are huge needs in the area of housing, to which my colleague referred. I have also referred to social welfare. We hear the continuing mantra in relation to cutting back on the total tax portion of GDP in this economy but, according to EUROSTAT, our tax and social contribution at 34.1 per cent of GDP is the lowest of all the countries in the EU &ndash; Sweden's contribution is 54.1 per cent, Denmark's is 53 per cent, Finland's is 47 per cent, Belgium's is 46 per cent, Italy's is 44 per cent, Portugal's is 37.9 per cent, Spain's is 36 per cent and the UK's is 35.9 per cent with its 20 per cent and 40 per cent tax rates. It is extraordinary that we still have to listen to this mantra from Fianna Fáil and PD Ministers year on year in regard to our huge tax burden when obviously we are the least taxed country in the world.</P>
    <P>We have seen already from replies to recent questionnaires that people want whatever resources are necessary for health and housing. They are demanding that we put in the resources necessary for a decent, inclusive society. My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has written about the difference between an economy and a society. The parties in Government have treated us like an economy in difficulty rather than one with the highest growth rate in the history of economics and projected growth rates of 6 per cent over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>Besides the health and housing crises, we have a water supply crisis in the Dublin region. Because the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is not prepared to spend more than 5 per cent per annum on growth and capital budgets, the water supply system on the north side of the city is on a knife-edge.</P>
    <P>Section 17 relates to pensions. It is a subject to which I will return in the next few weeks when we are debating the Social Welfare Bill and in discussing the amendments on Committee Stage of this Bill. I would like to know who made the demands which form the basis of section 17. It is obvious to most Deputies that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, totally ignored the Pensions Board. He ignored the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and has ridden a coach and four through <Col N="1095" /> the central thesis of the Pensions Board's report by coming up with these provisions. The idea of giving people more autonomy and deregulating the private pensions market for the self-employed has some merits, but the Minister has created an extremely dangerous situation by creating a huge divide between employees' pensions and the pensions of the self-employed. Placing such a low limit of £50,000 when people are capitalising on pensions gives rise to the real fear that at a certain stage we could be faced with a situation where people who had been self-employed or in business will have to depend upon the non-contributory social welfare system, in other words, on our taxation system. I ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to consult his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, about this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the U-turns of this Minister. I hope to have the opportunity to return to them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Conor Lenihan and Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin. This debate gives us a rare opportunity to look back over what this Government has done in the year and a half it has been in office. Our colleague, Deputy Broughan, says that taxation should be increased. I hope he will publicise that to those who will benefit from the changes in personal allowances. Our taxation system needed a radical shake-up and in this budget a start has been made.</P>
      <P>Certain benefits of the tiger economy over the past two years have accrued more to the eastern part of the country than to the part I represent. The Celtic tiger has found it very hard to get past Mullingar. This year's budget contains some incentives that will help to deal with the problem of lack of industrial development and lack of development generally, particularly in the region I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In last year's budget the Minister for Finance introduced the rural renewal scheme, an innovative scheme aimed at trying to redress the imbalance between east and west. In his Budget Statement the Minister indicated that he would be making changes. We all welcome the changes he is proposing under section 41 of this Bill. The changes in the rural renewal scheme mean that there will be an incentive for people to move to and live in the designated areas. It might also help to alleviate some of this city's problems. It might be hard to believe, but I have constituents who commute on a daily basis from my constituency to Dublin, because of the quality of life in rural Ireland and the cost of housing in this city. This is something that will have to be looked at more and more. In other countries commuters spend anything up to two hours commuting to and from work. However, in this city if one happens to get caught up in the traffic it could take an hour and a half to commute ten or 15 miles. There are incentives in the budget to try to deal with that, <Col N="1096" /> incentives such as park and ride schemes and the bus ticket initiative. These initiatives have a positive impact in encouraging people to leave their cars at home. It will also encourage people to move out to within the hour or hour and a half train journey if there is a proper rail service because that is becoming acceptable to many people &ndash; it is better than being stuck for an hour and a half in the traffic gridlock in this city.</P>
    <P>The tax changes in this budget are phenomenal. The increase in the tax free allowance for the PAYE sector is one of the largest I have seen in my 21 years in this House and will be of major benefit. It will encourage people to go to work &ndash; it has to be Government's aim to ensure that there is an incentive for people to work. There are also changes in the tax free allowances for senior citizens. That is important because these people have made a lifetime contribution to building this country and they are entitled to a reasonable share of what they have contributed to when it comes to tax provisions. These increases are welcomed by everybody because they will benefit people who made an enormous contribution to this country over their lifetime.</P>
    <P>In the context of the rural renewal scheme, there is a need to look at the square footage that is being suggested and possibly increase it because many old farm houses in my area are over the limit. Rather than leaving such farmhouses to decay, it would be more productive to increase the square footage allowed so that these houses can be inhabited and the rural landscape rejuvenated. Without people there can be no local economy. We have to give people an incentive to live in rural areas. Our small towns and villages depend on that. If the proposed Shannon corridor scheme is successful, similar schemes could be initiated in other areas in the future. It has been proven and EUROSTAT has come to accept that the counties singled out for a continuation of Objective One status are entitled to that status but it is something many people do not accept.</P>
    <P>A measure which will be welcomed by parents of third level students is the proposed incentives for the provision of accommodation for such students. The amount rural parents must pay for accommodation in towns and cities for their children attending third level has caused nightmares for them. The increases in grants are not sufficient to sustain students in any reasonable lifestyle and their parents have had to make enormous sacrifices to keep them in third level education. If this scheme is properly run and sufficient accommodation is provided, it will help reduce the rents paid at present for accommodation.</P>
    <P>The changes concerning facilities for the elderly are welcome. Greater use of private nursing homes will mean that in many cases the State will not have to maintain people in public hospitals. That situation is developing at the moment.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Finance Bill for education are welcome. The recent announcement by <Col N="1097" /> the Minister for Education and Science regarding the local contribution for school extensions and new schools is of major benefit to local communities in that there will now be a cap on the amount they will be expected to pay for the provision of new facilities.</P>
    <P>Another important measure is the additional funding for the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The increase in road grants of 13 to 14 per cent will make a tremendous difference to people in rural Ireland. In my county, it means road works schemes scheduled for 2001 and 2002 will be carried out this year. That is of enormous importance. Certain sections of the national road system need to be dealt with urgently and extra funding should be provided for that. There is a need to examine other incentives which could help upgrade the road infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The rail system is in need of upgrading &ndash; I have said this on previous occasions in the House. The commitments given by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to the rail lines to the west are to be welcomed and supported by everyone living in the region. If the regions are to be developed, the infrastructure will have to be provided. This is something which is tremendously important to me.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Broughan refer to the health debate which will take place later. He is being unrealistic in not giving credit to the current Minister for the increases he has obtained for the health service. Health is a major issue but people only take notice of it when someone in their family falls ill. The Minister's proposals for reducing waiting lists are to be welcomed and encouraged. However, we should also be aware that there are certain areas in the health service in need of a little belt tightening. People in need of surgery should not be subject to belt tightening in terms of resources available to them, but there are other areas where some tightening could occur and perhaps that could be examined.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes in the Finance Bill are welcome. There is a little unease regarding the powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners. People have nothing to fear, except those who have been involved in tax evasion. However, to boost public confidence, a public statement should be made that these powers are not intended to make life awkward for compliant taxpayers. Perhaps it could be examined on Committee Stage whether safeguards could be included in the Bill to allay people's fears of an unscrupulous Revenue Commissioner going over the top. The Minister has gone a long way to clarify the matter in his speech and, if there is need for further clarification, I am sure he and his officials will deal with it between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will help prolong the growth rate in the economy which will be important in allowing us lay the foundations for the next generation. We are able to do so now and, at the same time, give people many extra incentives to work and assist the poorer sections of the com<Col N="1098" /> munity. The Social Welfare Bill, which will shortly come before the House, will do much good for people caught in the poverty trap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Ellis, I was struck by the contribution of Deputy Broughan. It sounded like something old that we had not heard for a long time. It will be hard for him to get the genie he has let out in this debate back into the bottle. Deputy Broughan told us the old socialist thinking of high taxation and confiscatory taxation policies is back in business in the Labour Party. His was a remarkable contribution in that regard. We were fed propaganda in the past week or two since the merger of the Labour Party and Democratic Left that this was some seismic socialist or social democratic shift on the political landscape. From what Deputy Broughan had to say, it appears it is the opposite. He has clearly indicated that the Labour Party, if returned to Government, will be in favour of raising taxation rather than lowering it. Deputy Broughan clearly believes that, while this is a low taxation economy, it should be transformed into a middle or high taxation one. That is a remarkable policy.</P>
      <P>I thought the Labour Party had moved with the times when Deputy Quinn became leader but it appears not. Rather it has been left to Fianna Fáil to represent the social democratic principles which are prevalent everywhere, be it in America, on the Continent or in the UK. It appears Fianna Fáil is the one true custodian of the social democratic spirit in Irish political life. I thought all the old socialist thinking went out when the Berlin Wall collapsed, but clearly even among the younger and newer Deputies in the Labour Party, of which Deputy Broughan is one, this thinking continues.</P>
      <P>It is very surprising that, in his contribution on the economy, Deputy Broughan spoke of the U-turn of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. This is a remarkable statement and does not stand up to rational analysis. The Minister has been one of the most remarkably consistent Deputies in the House. He was for many years outspoken, open, honest, frank and forthright in his approach on the need for fiscal rectitude and prudent management of the public finances, even though it was to the disadvantage of his career when Mr. Haughey was leader of Fianna Fáil for him to argue against his own Government and highlight the profligate approach being taken with the national finances. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, deserves to be commended for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is not just a position he held then. It is not a matter, as Eoghan Harris puts it, of &ldquo;That was then and this is now&rdquo;. What one finds with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is a remarkable degree of consistency. Not only did he state those views in 1979 on what was best for the wellbeing of the economy, he had the foresight, consistency and dedication to carry them through many years of disturbance in Fianna Fáil to the time when, belatedly in his political career, he <Col N="1099" /> became Minister for Finance. He is an open, honest and frank politician determined to continue the good work of the Government in taxation and other matters. Fianna Fáil is a party committed as much in spirit and in practice as the Labour Party to social justice in the economy and that will not be ignored by the Government. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is also remarkably consistent in his approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>I was flattered that Deputy Broughan thought it appropriate to quote our Ard Fhéis delegates in saying that Minister McCreevy would be a favourite for the leadership of our party.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to linger too long criticising the Labour Party. I was struck by Deputy Higgins's contribution which was in stark contrast to that of Deputy Broughan. It appears Deputy Higgins is much more flexible, pragmatic and ready to move with the times, in terms of both his previous socialist thinking and his arrival at social democracy. I agree with his admonishment to the Minister in relation to the credit unions which have a special role to play.</P>
      <P>I also commend the Labour Party on coming up with the idea of the third force in banking when it originally set out its stand before the 1992 election. We are now in the enviable position of seeing not only a third but a fourth and fifth force in banking. The TSB-ACC merger and the building societies and the Irish Permanent in particular are a sort of fifth force in banking.</P>
      <P>We are not being radical enough in relation to the banking sector. The Minister could take steps to create a more competitive environment in our financial and banking sector. In this regard, I would like him to put forward the case for creating a new joint venture for An Post so it can transform itself, with its excellent communications infrastructure and its many retail outlets, in a joint venture with another post office bank abroad and become a sixth layer of the banking sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like An Post to develop for the benefit of its workforce and champion the cause of electronic banking. It appears little is being done in this area by the mainstream banks. They are not <Col N="1100" /> making the necessary investment for our banking sector to remain competitive in the larger European set-up when the era of electronic commerce emerges. An Post, particularly through its subsidiary PostGEM, is ideally placed to take up this role, a role that has been taken up by a large number of post office banks in the Scandinavian countries.</P>
    <P>I was struck by Deputy Higgins's suggestion about the music industry. The Minister should examine the possibility of extending the taxation benefits given to the film industry to the music industry. There are enormous wealth and job creation possibilities if the music industry were developed in the way the film industry was developed in recent years.</P>
    <P>This Minister has an enviable record in relation to his budgets. They have been consistent, fair-minded and dedicated to lightening the tax burden on the ordinary individual taxpayer. I stress the words &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; and &ldquo;individual&rdquo; because the individual taxpayer has had to put up with a great deal. The recent political history of our State is perhaps defined by the tax march of 1979. In fairness to the Progressive Democrats, they grew as a party because they identified the problem that the country was over-burdened with tax. I am not talking about big businessmen but ordinary taxpayers who were paying too much tax.</P>
    <P>This budget is a radical shift in terms of lightening the burden on the ordinary PAYE taxpayer, but at the same time moving the essential principles that underpin our tax system to a solid grounding in the principle of equity of treatment with the focus on the middle to lower paid earner. It is a remarkable achievement that 80,000 people have been taken out of the tax net and I suspect most Members opposite would like to have had the opportunity to introduce that budget. The Minister pointed out that the 80,000 people taken out of the tax net includes 15,000 elderly people. Again, this was a serious issue that many Deputies faced on the doorsteps. Older people, particularly those on lower incomes, felt their pensions were being eroded by high taxation.</P>
    <P>Another remarkable aspect of this Finance Bill is the new powers being accorded to the Revenue Commissioners. Many people are complaining about that and I suppose that will always be the case in a country like ours which is moving from a background of high taxation to a new environment of low taxation. As a result of the Finance Bill and the tribunals ongoing in Dublin Castle we are marking out a definitive shift from a culture of non-compliance to one of compliance. Ordinary PAYE taxpayers have nothing to fear from the additional powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners. The PAYE taxpayer is not being placed on notice as a result of these powers; it is the repeat non-compliant taxpayer who should fear these measures.</P>
    <P>I was reassured by what Mr. Dermot Quigley, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, said in a lunchtime radio interview the other day. He said this measure would not be directed at the <Col N="1101" /> ordinary taxpayer, but at those who were involved in serious larceny against the State by way of tax evasion. That is as it should be and it is time we made a shift in that direction to ensure those who offend in this manner are punished by the full rigours of the law. The Revenue Commissioners are now capable of conducting a policy of criminal prosecution against people who perpetrate persistent and serious fraud against the taxpayer. That is a welcome development and I am glad this Minister, and previous Ministers, have given the Revenue Commissioners the resources needed to do this. It is shameful that until the past year or two the Revenue Commissioners did not have a sufficient number of legal advisers available to them to pursue the full route of criminal prosecution of tax evaders. That is another welcome feature of the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister has emphasised, as did the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Quigley, that there must be <i>prima facie </i>evidence of serious tax evasion before these powers can be invoked. That is good news. We are now moving from a culture of non-compliance to one of compliance and that value is shared by all Members of the House, irrespective of party.</P>
    <P>There are other challenges remaining. Those who analyse poverty have pointed out that up to 20 per cent of our population live in poverty. If that is the case it is a scandal which must be addressed. The Government is moving decisively in that direction, but if the figure of 20 per cent is correct, there is a huge task facing everybody in the House, not least the Minister for Finance, to tackle that problem. We must focus on the issue of social disadvantage, but we must ensure spending is targeted at those most in need, whether it be in housing, child care or education. The people who must benefit are those who live in disadvantaged communities. We should not pass on the benefits of our economy to advantaged communities but to those that are clearly not benefiting in any way.</P>
    <P>A working group from the social partners has been set up to examine the question of child care. I have some questions about the thrust of the group. It appears that at least in some cases the social partners become rather obsessed about those in work and forget that there is a community of people who are either on low pay or who are unemployed. We must cater for those people particularly in relation to child care. Those people are entitled to benefit from any tax credits or child care system. We need to reintroduce those people to the world of work because, unfortunately, as Members are aware, there are many second and third generation unemployed in the system. That is not acceptable and we must try to counter it.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for that clarification.</P>
      <P>When I spoke in the budget debate in December, I said the Minister for Finance had clearly been conscious of the widespread and correct interpretation of his previous budget as one for the wealthy. The Government had to acknowledge that the benefits of the economic up-turn were not enjoyed by great numbers of the population. I welcome the positive aspects of the budget, such as the easing of the tax burden on the lower paid, some of which measures are contained in this Bill. What has yet to be acknowledged, let alone addressed, by the Government, however, is the fundamental inequality in society which sees the gap between wealth and poverty widening as increased wealth is created. Key provisions in the Bill will reinforce that trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives extensive new powers to the Revenue Commissioners to access bank accounts. It is a great pity that the spotlight has not been turned on the banks. As well as facilitating those people who defraud the compliant taxpayer, the banks enjoy a position of enormous privilege. <Col N="1103" /> The huge profits being made by financial institutions are not being harnessed for the economic benefit of the nation. In recent days the country has been incensed by revelations of how powerful and privileged people who incurred debts to the banks can receive favourable treatment with massive debts written off in cosy appointments with the leading executives. Contrast this with the tardy and, indeed, often contemptuous treatment by the banks of the small investor and customer who is pursued ruthlessly for the smallest debt. There is no better example of the continuing culture of privilege in Irish society.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that in the Bill the Minister is trying to tackle tax evasion perpetrated by a range of sectors. However, the experience of the Ansbacher accounts shows that tax evasion happens in an international context beyond the remit of any Government. There is no recognition in the Bill of this international context.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to make a substantive contribution to the Bill within the time constraints in which we are expected to operate. I welcome the positive and much needed provisions in the Bill to improve the tax system. They are in line with, but not as high as, expectations. In respect of the elderly, widows, widowers and families the Bill contains some taxation improvements but there is still a considerable distance to go. Widows and widowers must live on a fixed income, which they can supplement to some extent but which is liable to tax, and it leaves them in considerable difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not support income tax or social welfare fraud. I wish I had Deputy Lenihan's confidence in the new measures and my constituents do not have his confidence in these proposals. I hope people do not get the impression that insufficient laws existed previously. My fear, and that of the public, is that the new regulations will not necessarily be applied against the appropriate people. For example for many years an elderly person with a disability seeking a disabled person's grant to extend his or her home required a tax clearance certificate. Such a certificate was also required by an applicant for a local authority loan despite the fact that the person might be on the housing list and entitled to be rehoused. I do not know why there is a need for this. When that <Col N="1104" /> requirement was in place, there were other avenues open to other people. That is where the problem lies. That is why my constituents, and many others, are looking somewhat askance at the new proposal and asking whether they will be applied to them and not to others.</P>
    <P>In the budget and Bill it was important that the Minister addressed the problems of rural Ireland. There are improvements in the Bill but nothing which enhances the fabric of society in rural Ireland. Many areas have a small and diminishing population. Deputy Ellis referred to parts of the country which come within that category, but I do not agree with him that the Bill contains the measures necessary to resolve the problems of the people who live there.</P>
    <P>The serious national housing crisis, which could have been addressed in the budget and the Bill remains. This serious problem is getting greater. A Government Deputy said that health was not a serious problem and the Minister was doing a great job. If that is true, somebody is codding us because the public is concerned about health issues. The Bill does not do anything to assuage their concerns nor is there likely to be because the culture and thinking of the Department of Finance on health policy is not helpful.</P>
    <P>My final point concerns overseas development aid, an issue which prompted the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell to threaten to resign earlier in the year. Fortunately, she did not carry out that threat. I am not sure whether it was a good idea to issue the threat. However, the targets to which she aspired when in Opposition are far from being reached. The proposal to spread the burden over a number years to give the impression of achieving targets does not cod anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the absence of any realistic measures to tackle the urban traffic congestion problem and, in particular, the lack of any provision for Dublin Bus. All reports indicate that Dublin Bus cannot meet the demand for bus services without such a subvention. I welcome the tax incentives the Bill provides for park and ride services. However, a car park where it is not possible to take a bus or train is useless. The Minister has failed to make our tax system more green or to make provisions to improve our air quality and to ensure it complies with EU directives and with the terms of the Kyoto protocol. He proffered the increase in VRT as a green tax. It is nothing more than a revenue raising exercise and, as the Minister anticipated, car sales have continued to increase, as has the income to the Minister. If he had been serious about reducing toxic emissions from cars, he would have paid significant attention to changing the relative duty levels of dirty and clean fuels or perhaps funded a switch to cleaner fuels by the urban bus fleets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government is not persuaded by social or environmental arguments, there are good economic reasons for encouraging a change to public transport and for providing a good public <Col N="1105" /> transport system. All the economic analyses indicate that huge revenue is foregone because of the deteriorating level of traffic congestion which also jeopardises our potential to sustain growth.</P>
    <P>The law on inheritance tax concerns a number of people. This tax rightly recognises the rights of the spouse and children of deceased persons by according them higher threshold levels before they become liable for inheritance tax. There are thousands of families in which parents are living together in stable relationships and who, for a variety of reasons, are not married to each other. On the death of either partner, the surviving partner is regarded by the tax code as a stranger, as are his or her children, although they may have been cared for over many years and regarded by the deceased person as his or her children in all but name. Such situations can result in the sale of the family home, and all the disruption that goes with that, to pay inheritance tax. In fairness and equity, the Minister should amend the Bill and give these families the same treatment as married couples. If there are revenue implications they are very minor and a deep injustice could be remedied by a simple amendment.</P>
    <P>Public service pensioners are discriminated against because they have paid a modified PRSI over many years. The situation regarding public servants' PRSI has changed but there are pensioners who, because they pay the modified PRSI, do not qualify for social welfare pensions and, in turn, do not qualify for non-cash benefits such as the free TV licence. Many of these pensioners live in very poor circumstances, particularly as they grow older and their health costs increase. This difficulty was recognised by the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, when he increased the disregarded income for eligibility by £30 per week. That was in 1996 and it is surely time to increase it again. The country can now afford to allow every citizen, or at least those over 75 years, automatic entitlement to non-cash benefits. It is inherently unjust that public service pensioners should pay tax, PRSI and levies and not receive benefits which are available to people who are in much better circumstances, receiving social welfare and occupational pensions. There is no reason for making non-cash benefits dependent on the level of PRSI payments.</P>
    <P>Acute disappointment was felt by thousands of young families at the absence of any attempt to deal with the child care issue. Young families who voted for the Government parties on the basis of pre-election promises now see a second budget in which no attempt has been made to address the problem. This is acutely felt in urban areas, particularly in Dublin where couples are forced out to work by high housing costs while high child care costs negate the value of their efforts. This is a complex social problem which needs more than one simple solution, but that is not an excuse for doing nothing.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the need to attract women back to work; we cannot even keep them <Col N="1106" /> at work. We are losing educated, skilled, motivated and valuable members of the workforce simply because it does not make economic sense for them to stay at work and pay £1,000 per month for child care. We are making a huge investment in education to ensure people have choices in life, but these women are being left with no choice. The Minister ignores this problem at his peril.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's move to introduce tax credits. The Fine Gael Party has advocated this measure for a long time. I also welcome the extension of a tax allowance for the employment of a carer, including the hiring of a carer through an agency, for a family member.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the inheritance tax threshold. If a parent dies, leaving a son or daughter living in a house worth £300,000 &ndash; that would not be unusual in Dublin &ndash; such a son or daughter would have a taxable inheritance of approximately £110,000. He or she would have to pay 20 per cent on £10,000, 30 per cent on the next £30,000 and 40 per cent on the balance of £70,000. The tax on that amount would be £39,000 which, added to probate tax of about £6,000, would leave a total tax bill of £45,000. The allowance for dependent children is not sufficient and this question must be examined. The case of brothers and sisters must also be examined. The level of tax paid by a brother or sister who inherits property from a sibling is also high. I hope the Minister will examine these matters carefully.</P>
      <P>If George Orwell were to come back to life he would say the powers the Government have acquired were greater than he had described in <i>Nineteen Eighty Four. </i>When a person leaves home in his car he or she can be stopped by a garda investigating motor tax and insurance, which is highly desirable. Customs officials may dip his or her tank to see if the correct diesel is being used. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs now proposes that people should be stopped and asked if their PRSI and tax affairs are in order.</P>
      <P>However, the considerable power of the law has, regrettably, not been used correctly. A list of 27 people who were fined for tax offences was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 16 December 1998. Of the 27 listed only four owed more than £30,000. Are they the only wealthy people evading tax? Given that the powers are available, ordinary individuals will be penalised for the sins of a few. The powers were sought because the system had been blackguarded. Adequate powers are essential but let us not penalise ordinary individuals. Great care is needed and if an Ombudsman is deemed necessary to protect the people, I would welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few brief points. Virtually all speakers referred to vehicle registration tax. Given that the scrappage scheme came to an end, I was surprised at the increase in vehicle registration tax. The <Col N="1107" /> Minister may make the argument that the sale of cars has continued to increase. Be that as it may, many families who had budgeted for a new car in 1999 have been hit by this measure; it is termed by some as a retrospective tax. Other than an income raising measure, I cannot see the necessity for it. Life is difficult enough for motorists without imposing this additional penalty. A car, in most cases, is not a luxury item, but rather a necessity.</P>
      <P>Section 42 introduces capital allowances for expenditure on private convalescent facilities. It is envisaged that patients recovering from acute hospital treatment will be accommodated in these premises. This is a welcome measure. Not only should the guidelines, due to be issued by the Minister for Health and Children, be all inclusive and comprehensive but a system should be in place to ensure that the laid down standards of facility and service are adhered to. While acknowledging there are many fine private nursing homes, I had occasion recently to visit a new accommodation which was not too inviting as the design and structure were aimed at profit as opposed to service and comfort.</P>
      <P>Equally, section 43 provides capital allowances for expenditure on child care facilities. It is important to ensure the correct motive is applicable and that the development will be to the advantage of the children who frequent it.</P>
      <P>Section 44 provides relief similar to section 23 relief. While I realise the Minister has not formulated the shape of such a scheme, the accommodation should be on campus and measures should be put in place to allow the private developer carry out work and implement the lease-back arrangement. To implement it on a broad basis would not be satisfactory as this would be extremely difficult to control and we might eventually arrive back at square one. On campus student accommodation has proved successful. It can make college life much more pleasant and students are protected from landlords who do not adhere to their moral obligations. Certain control over rents can be exerted. It should help roll back some of the down sides of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, introduced to implement the Bacon report.</P>
      <P>Section 63 provides for the granting of capital allowances for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of qualifying park and ride facilities. In many areas where there is a requirement for such a facility there is a scarcity of space. When drawing up the qualifying guidelines I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to be flexible in his approach. If various clubs or institutions nearby can provide a parking facility, they should not be discounted as that may be the only option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many welcome measures in the area of income tax. I welcome the move to tax credits and those measures aimed at the handicapped. This is a question we have never adequately addressed. I hope, as the economy grows and <Col N="1108" /> there is greater wealth, we will not leave a patient immobile in a Cheshire home for two days because the health board cannot provide a wheelchair battery.</P>
    <P>I regret there were no tax measures to encourage investment in the areas of disadvantage in education. Such a measure was introduced last year. Has it been a success? While money has been given to the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for relief work and the renovation of listed buildings, I had hoped for some measure in the Bill. Will the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, ask his colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, about an old building in the Glen of Imaal, Coolmoney House, County Wicklow, which is due to be demolished. When I contacted the Minister's office about it, I was informed there is a technical report on file which suggests the building is unsafe. However, I ask him, if possible, to put a stay on the demolition of the building given its historical significance for many people in the area and for former and serving members of the Defence Forces. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would bring this matter to the attention of the Minister and perhaps get an independent consultant to examine the safety aspect.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question, a couple of times during the year, seeking to establish the tax relief given on a measure introduced in the Finance Bill, 1994. It is unusual for the Department not to cost its measures. Are all the measures in the Bill costed? </P>

      <P>The explanation will be communicated to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate how daunting it must be to come to grips with an enormous Bill of over 300 pages. I appreciate even more how difficult it is for <Col N="1110" /> spokesmen on that side to react to proposals to be inserted in the Bill which they have not yet seen.</P>
    <P>I accept the force of the comments made in this regard. Every effort will be made to have the relevant provisions published in good time for Committee Stage. If the House will permit, I must explain there are particular reasons for the procedure of inserting the main pension provisions and some of the IRNR material on Committee Stage. The proposed pension changes are complex; they require particular teasing out, much discussion with officials in the Department and the Revenue Commissioners and a considerable deal of consultation with the pensions sector and various interested commentators.</P>
    <P>The Minister insisted that, as it was not physically possible to have the legislation in the Bill as published, the fullest details should be given in the material accompanying the Bill on its publication. This took the form of a very detailed six page appendix to the summary of the Finance Bill measures issued with the Bill on 11 February.</P>
    <P>In the case of IRNRs, the main tax provisions are in the Bill as published. These are being complemented by measures in the company law Bill to be announced shortly. The Government was anxious that a comprehensive set of company law and tax measures should be allowed simultaneously, given the hybrid nature of the problem. As Deputy Noonan indicated, the Finance Bill has a certain immutable timetable laid down in law. Ideally, it would be preferable to have the companies Bill published at the same time as this Bill. Unfortunately that was not possible. It was not feasible, therefore, for technical reasons to include some of the tax measures which cross refer to the company law measures in the Finance Bill as published and, consequently, these will have to go in on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope the House can accept this explanation. It was the Minister's intention to avoid substantive insertions on Committee Stage, for the valid reasons explained by Deputy Noonan, but this proved unattainable. The Minister has spoken to the chairman of the committee to arrange for extended time on Committee Stage. The option is there, in ordering the time allocation, to make sufficient time available for the more important provisions in the Bill and less for those areas not requiring the same degree of parliamentary input.</P>
    <P>One important area is that of Revenue powers. I am glad Deputies Noonan, McDowell and others welcome the provision of such powers. As the Minister said in his opening remarks, we must make a choice. If we want to seriously combat tax evasion, Revenue must be equipped with the necessary powers. We can debate, as we undoubtedly will on Committee Stage, whether we have the balance right, whether there are sufficient safeguards and what procedures and parameters might be laid down to guide those using their powers. It is clear, however, that extra powers are required.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners indicated they <Col N="1111" /> will update their &ldquo;Statement of Practice on Powers&rdquo; in light of these new provisions and will introduce appropriate checks and balances. This is in response to the important point raised by Deputy Noonan. The proposed powers are not inserted to hound the small man or to conduct busy body searches of individual's bank accounts. They have been framed after detailed consideration by the Revenue and the Department of Finance. Part of that consideration involved a special study of revenue powers in other countries &ndash; the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, US and New Zealand &ndash; with visits to several of these tax authorities by officials from the Revenue and the Department.</P>
    <P>The study showed all these countries to be well in advance of what we do, particularly in regard to bank accounts. As the Minister admitted, and Deputy Noonan concurred, the best course would have been to await the findings of the various tribunals. The Government, as is its prerogative, considered it necessary to act now to allay public concern about the recent tax scandals. The proposals are not a knee jerk reaction or political ploy, as seems to be suggested. The powers are based on what Revenue sought and on its experience and knowledge of recent events.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance listened with great care to the sound advice in the House and will reflect on what was said before Committee Stage. There may be confusion over the effect of the provisions on the privilege of confidentiality. There is not a proposal to impose severe penalties on professionals, solicitors and accountants who advise and assist taxpayers in ordering their affairs or who breach legal professional privilege. These provisions are not a re-run of section 153 of the 1995 Bill on reporting of tax evasion to Revenue.</P>
    <P>Neither is there a wish to provide unfettered access to accounts or engage in examinations of accounts without good reason. Where powers of access are to be exercised in the case of unidentified accounts or classes of account holders, High Court or appeal commissioners' approval will be required. Deputy Ardagh can be assured it is not proposed to use the powers to conduct an on-site audit of a bank's affairs as a blind for a trawl through bank accounts. The rules of the game will be the responsible use of those powers. Revenue has shown itself to be measured and balanced in these matters. I am sure the commissioners recognise the need for a proportionate and targeted exercise of such new powers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan raised a number of specific issues. The pre-funding of social welfare pensions, which was also raised by Deputy McDowell, is the subject of an interdepartmental examination. On the subject of tax credits it is not fair to say the Minister took only a partial step in this direction in the budget. The standard rating of the basic personal allowances gets us almost 90 per cent of the way. The standard rating of other personal allowances will be addressed in the next <Col N="1112" /> budget in a way which will not leave the persons concerned worse off as a result of the move.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Noonan welcomed the so-called &ldquo;Shane Broderick&rdquo; provision. The Deputy has ideas on how that might be extended to other circumstances and I am sure the Minister will listen to those on Committee Stage. The Deputy also raised the issue of CAT biting even harder on domestic situations because of the rise in house prices. I am aware the Minister studied this issue in detail prior to the budget, decided to make a number of changes and look at it again before the next budget. CAT brings in more than £180 million per year. Any radical changes will cost a significant amount of the yield and will, given the nature of CAT, benefit a restricted number of taxpayers. The Minister is mindful of the issues raised by the Deputy. However, finding a balanced and fair solution at a reasonable cost is the tricky part.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also raised the issue of certain tax reliefs having to be paid back to the Exchequer under state aids. That is not on the cards but we must argue our case in Brussels. The best advice we have is that such concerns, although valid, should not be transformed into scares. The Minister has successfully secured the capital allowance regime for the Custom House docks areas concerned. A case is being actively made to the Commission for commercial reliefs under urban and rural renewal, double rent reliefs and rates remission for the area.</P>
    <P>The Commission has set its face against double rent reliefs and rates remissions as operating aids and these will not be approved by it in the future for areas outside the Article 92(3)(a) regions. The criteria for Article 92(3)(a) areas are the same as those on which Objective One status is based. Thus, additional benefits are to be gained from securing such status for as much of the country as can be justified.</P>
    <P>The Commission's concerns on state aids grounds relate to commercial tax reliefs. The reliefs for residential purposes do not require state aid approval. For this reason the residential reliefs are in place since last June in the case of rural renewal. The implementation of the residential tax incentive elements of the new urban renewal scheme was announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government today as well as a new tax relief scheme to be drawn up which is aimed at the restoration of townscapes in smaller towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan, McDowell, Deenihan and Ryan, among others, mentioned the film industry. The Minister has given an assurance that rolling reliefs forward does not mean the end of film relief. It is a valuable incentive to film making here and is recognised as such by the Government. We want the relief to continue to work to secure the Government's aims for the industry. We also want the publication of the special reports on the industry by the Government think-tank and its detailed consideration is the best way <Col N="1113" /> to address the appropriate policies for State support in this area. Deputies Noonan and McDowell made a number of interesting comments, both practical and philosophical, on profit sharing schemes and I am sure there will be a useful examination on Committee Stage of the appropriate way to proceed in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell devoted a large part of his contribution to expenditure policy, multi-annual budgeting, financial envelopes, the basis of no policy change estimates and the stability programme submitted to the European Commission before Christmas. While all these are matters worthy of discussion, in the limited time I have, I will deal with the items he raised that are relevant to the Bill. Perhaps the Deputy might accept the Minister responding to him separately on the budgetary and expenditure issues he raised.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy on the need for significant investment in developing our infrastructure. This Government, more than any other in recent years, has given this problem the serious attention it demands. Substantial increases in public capital investment have been and are being undertaken. The increase in voted capital spending in 1998 over 1997, based on outturn figures, was 27 per cent. The post-budget 1999 allocation over 1998 outturn provides for a 15 per cent increase. Voted capital expenditure will have increased by a cumulative 61 per cent by 2001 over the 1997 outturn.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised two concerns in the pensions area. One was that we might make too generous a provision and, thus, facilitate tax planning rather than prudent pension provision. This is not the intention. Tax will be paid, as at present, when the fund or the income is drawn down. The tax provisions will, nonetheless, take sensitive account of certain situations of surviving spouses and minor children, and this is only right.</P>
    <P>The second concern related to the need for security in pension provision and to avoid persons being prevailed upon by some to dispose unwisely of their savings. The Minister's proposals seek to address that by requiring that a substantial sum be kept in an approved minimum retirement fund as security. The Deputy also believes the Minister's proposals fly in the face of what the national pensions initiative proposed last year but I do not see it that way. Both initiatives seek to enhance and secure retirement provision. The national pensions initiative proposal for a personal retirement savings account, PRSA, is still on the table.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also mentioned credit unions. The Minister will publish the report of the working group on credit unions in the next few days. The Deputy will be able to see there the facts marshalled and both sides of the issues argued out. The credit unions are seeking effective exemption of credit union dividends from income tax. Credit unions already receive favourable tax treatment through an exemption of income from corporation tax. This recognises their special voluntary status. The Minister is con<Col N="1114" /> sidering the working group's report. One new fact to which attention should be drawn is the role of the EU Commission under State aids rules. A consideration that apparently influences the Commission in not getting worried under State aids rules about the exemption of credit unions from corporation tax is the fact that the members are liable to income tax on the dividends. This factor is worth reflecting on in the context of the credit unions' proposals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ardagh referred to the legitimate role of public representatives in making representations to Revenue on behalf of their constituents. The handling of such issues is entirely for the Revenue Commissioners, but I believe they have no problem with the points he made and have long-standing arrangements to ensure representations from public representatives are attended to in an expeditious manner. On Revenue powers, the Deputy also perceptively pointed to the new power for Revenue to check one's statement of assets against what one has put on one's insurance policy. I am sure some hidden assets will be revealed by this new power of cross-checking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin felt the Bill should go further in relation to child care. The issue of child care provision is receiving detailed consideration at present. A special interdepartmental committee has been set up to examine the various reports and proposals in this complex area. It held its first meeting under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform last Monday, 15 February, with a view to the preparation of an early White Paper on this matter. The Finance Bill provides, in the meantime, for tax measures to add to the supply of child care places. I am sure the House will agree supply side measures are the effective way to address cost pressures in the child care area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan expressed misgivings about the increase in VRT rates and indicated he would seek changes on Committee Stage. It is worth reminding ourselves that nearly 60 per cent of new cars &ndash; those up to 1400 cc &ndash; incurred no change in VRT from 1 January 1999, while for many of the rest the increases were relatively modest. The car buying population seems to have got this message, as evidenced by the fact that new car sales were up 21 per cent in January 1999. The car trade is booming thanks to other Government policies of reducing business taxes, personal taxes and interest rates. We should put all things into the balance when weighing up the VRT issue.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies called for the extension of rural renewal. I have a personal interest in this issue because representations have been made to me by people from County Limerick, particularly those representing the Ballyhoura area. However, any such scheme must have a line drawn somewhere and, as always, those on the wrong side of the line see themselves as losing out. I appreciate their position and concern in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes made an interesting proposal <Col N="1115" /> that those promoting new tax schemes should be required to inform the Revenue. I am sure that suggestion has been carefully noted by the Department of Finance. If I am not mistaken, the US Internal Revenue Service has operated such a requirement since 1997.</P>
    <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate. This Finance Bill is, in many ways, a watershed. It contains provisions that reform our tax system in favour of the lower paid; it copperfastens a <Col N="1116" /> pro-business tax regime to maintain our job creation record; it provides much needed reliefs in many areas, especially in social areas such as accommodation, education, health, child care and traffic management; it requires those who can pay their fair share to do so; and it equips the Revenue Commissioners with powers to give the public greater assurance that this will happen.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The increased prosperity of the State is not reflected in the provision of adequate health services. The two tier system is becoming increasingly unfair. It is unfair and unjust to those who cannot afford to go private for their operations, which would give them a better quality of life. It is also unfair that some people must wait in pain and discomfort for up to two years for hip replacements and others must wait one and a half years for cataract operations. Some elderly people must wait up to 12 months to have their eyesight tested, during which time they are deprived of the simple pleasure of reading the newspapers.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that breast screening programmes which should have commenced last September will not commence until next autumn at the earliest. The Minister for Health and Children does not appear to have any understanding of the suffering and stress his policy is causing those who cannot pay upfront for services. I have been contacted by patients on medical cards who were advised by their doctors to go private because of the stress being caused by their condition. If they do that, they will be presented with a bill from the health board for which they do not have the finances to pay. They will then be threatened with court action, all of which does not help their convalescence.</P>
      <P>Approximately 3,000 women are awaiting mammograms. In December 1998 an estimated 38,000 patients were on the waiting list and last month more that 400 elderly patients in acute hospitals in need of nursing home care or convalescent care were on the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has failed to provide funding for the full commissioning of the Regional Hospital in Limerick. The people of the mid-west are entitled to hospital services on a par with those provided by the other health boards. The development of services at regional hospitals is crucial to achieving this. I ask the Minister present to review immediately the level of funding allocated to that hospital and to respond to the needs of the people of the mid-west who have the right to adequate hospital services. Hospitals in the mid-west will close wards during the sum<Col N="1119" /> mer. The policy of closing wards is a disgrace and should cease. The closure of wards to balance hospital budgets is a false economy. It results in paltry savings, prolongs pain and suffering, places at greater risk patients with life threatening conditions, demoralises hospital staff, contributes to the lengthening of the waiting list and, ultimately, puts additional pressure on the many accident and emergency departments. The cancellation of operations originally scheduled for the end of last year and early this year was partially responsible for the accident and emergency crisis which confronted our hospitals in January.</P>

      <P>Last week I got a phone call from a member of the staff in St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel requesting that I come to the hospital immediately. I knew from the caller's concerned voice that there was a crisis at the hospital. I was devastated by what I saw when I visited the hospital. There were seriously ill patients there, one was unconscious, another was fighting bravely for his life having had a stroke and three others were on trolleys in the corridor. The staff were exhausted and management was under severe stress. This is not only a local story, it is a national one.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that patients are being treated in the corridors of hospitals. It must be the greatest scandal of our times that our sick people cannot be admitted to a hospital ward. Can the Minister imagine the indignation, embarrassment and the sheer lack of human dignity of being treated in a corridor when one is at one's lowest ebb? That is human suffering due to the crisis in our hospitals caused by a shortage of beds. The Minister makes no secret of the fact that his priority is financial management, but his duty and responsibility is patient care. He has no business running a Department with responsibility for health unless he puts patients first.</P>
      <P>We all recall what he said when he commented on his coalition partners, &ldquo;when in doubt, leave them out&rdquo;. I fear he runs the hospital services on that ethos. We must be grateful to the medical profession who work on the principle of &ldquo;when in doubt, take them in&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The matron in St. Joseph's Hospital told me last Monday morning, when he was under severe stress that the hospital will continue to admit patients who need hospital care, even if they can only provide them with a trolley on the corridor. He said the hospital would do its best to provide them with medical care rather than let them go without it. It is ironic that on the morning I visited Clonmel hospital the Minister was interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. Did he talk about the health services or the crisis due to a shortage of beds? He did not mention hospital services.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is not prepared to administer his Department on the ethos of putting patients first, he should pass on the responsibility to someone who will put patients first.</P>

      <P>I spoke to the Minister about the problem in Tullamore hospital. A constituent of mine who requires a hip operation was told on the day he turned up for his appointment that he would have to return home because there was no bed available for him. He telephoned the hospital on the morning of his second appointment, but was also told a bed was not available. If one had a dental appointment for an extraction and was told on arrival that the dentist could not extract the tooth, one would be disappointed. One can imagine the disappointment of that elderly person, having prepared himself mentally for the operation when he was told on two occasions that a bed was not available. That man still has not had his operation. Tullamore hospital is in the Minister's home county and under the remit of the local health board, but he is not doing much to address the crisis there.</P>
      <P>The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, and Barry Desmond, fought to secure funding for the Longford-Westmeath hospital in Mullingar, which is now lying vacant. I ask the Minister to invest the necessary resources in that hospital to ensure it is fully operational because that is what the people of Longford and Westmeath deserve.</P>
      <P>I want to bring to the Minister's attention the position prevailing at Mount Carmel Hospital in Longford. There is no general hospital in Longford, patients must travel to the general hospital in Mullingar. We were promised a casualty unit in Longford hospital, but that has not transpired. The staff in the casualty unit in the general hospital are doing their best under difficult circumstances. I want the Minister to review the policy of closing beds in Mount Carmel Hospital. I represent that area and the Minister also represents the midlands. I want as many beds as possible in Longford hospital. I ask the Minister to ensure no beds are closed in that hospital. If he does not do that, I will come back to him on this.</P>

      <P>This motion of no confidence is a juvenile exercise in pre-school parliamentarianism, proposed by an Opposition which is unable, either in policy or performance, to match the work record and achievements of the Minister for Health and Children. The motion seeks to exploit those most vulnerable in society. Under the guise of concern for those in our midst <Col N="1121" /> who are afflicted by illness and infirmity, the Opposition is seeking ineptly to inflict political damage. It does so in full knowledge of the complexities and difficulties which all in this House seek to address so as to provide a decent and caring health service for the people. The Opposition makes its attempt in the absence of any coherent policy proposal. This is play school politics at its worst.</P>
      <P>Today the Opposition has chosen to engage in the politics of spite and bitterness. This is not new patriotism but rather new nihilism, attempted political destruction simply for the sake of destruction. It is mindless criticism proffered without any attempt at proposing policy alternatives. The health service is being seized as a crude political cudgel and used without regard to those most affected by it.</P>
      <P>Any properly focused debate on the state of our health service would acknowledge the achievements which have been attained and built upon. It would acknowledge the high level of expenditure which successive Governments have directed at the health services. Any such debate would reassure those who need to have recourse to our hospitals and medical services that ours is a service in which patients can properly place their faith and trust. Our standards are comparable to those of any developed country and we have avoided travelling the American route where assets are frequently a prerequisite to medical care and assistance. We are entitled to be proud of our health service. We are entitled to expect constructive debate which will reassure those in hospital or who have relatives or friends in hospital. We ought not to have an exercise in tabloid scaremongering which is precisely what this motion represents.</P>
      <P>Whatever criticism may be levelled at Fianna Fáil in Government or in Opposition, it cannot be said that we lack coherent policy alternatives. Time after time we introduced Private Members' Bills, set out our alternatives and frequently legislated from the Opposition benches. Ours was a constructive Opposition and our politics was that of democratic choice, policy alternatives and substance. The same cannot be said of the current Opposition which is geared to soundbite rather than substance. Baseless criticism, unfounded innuendo and political character assassination are the order of the day. In the contemptible prose of one of the chief gurus of this newly emerging school of political thought, this motion can be described as no more than a crude attempt to &ldquo;take out&rdquo; a decent and hard working member of the Government. Deputy Rabbitte, the self-appointed headmaster of this school of political thought, has transformed himself in a few short weeks from being the Voltaire of Democratic Left to the Dustin of the Labour Party, a turkey desperately seeking a microphone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not for Fianna Fáil to decide whether the old intellectualism of the Labour Party is to be swamped by the new nastiness of their newly acquired brethren. The battle between those who <Col N="1122" /> think and those who merely talk has clearly just begun. New Labour has yet to decide whether its soul belongs to the Channel 4 of Deputy Michael D. Higgins or the MTV of Deputy Rabbitte. This motion is strongly indicative that they propose to move towards the politics of thrash and away from the politics of substance. This bodes ill for the future of the Labour Party. The newly demoted Deputy Shortall can hardly welcome the down market direction in which her replacement has stained her portfolio. As she sits smouldering, having been deprived of her former responsibilities, she can hardly welcome the advent of the new nihilism being dictated by the dialectic die hards so recently rescued from the wreckage of Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>I frankly have no time for those who expound the politics of nihilism, those who criticise without proffering a solution, those who under the guise of social concern seek only to foster political mayhem. Their methods are base, their tactics deplorable and their motives dishonourable. The primary purpose of those who support tonight's motion of no confidence has nothing at all to do with the health service. Their motivation is far removed from concern or constructive criticism. This is a debate about politics, about the last general election, about the winners and losers. Most of all it is a debate which exposes the extent of the tactics which those ousted from power are prepared to utilise to overturn the democratic will of the people. Innuendo and rumour are the weapons of those bereft of political policy or popular appeal. The decent, hard working politicians who cannot be challenged fairly in the light of day are being stalked in the shadows by political opponents who have neither the honour nor courage to confront them openly.</P>
    <P>For the sake of politics and for the sake of a Minister discharging his responsibilities and duties without fear or favour, I urge that this opportunistic motion of no confidence be roundly defeated.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite will have to forgive me if I am more than a little sceptical of their approach to this debate. The Labour Party Deputies who have put their names to this motion know very well that they will not improve our health services one iota or better the lot of a single sick person in the country by coming to the House and heaping a litany of abuse on my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. It is a pity the Labour Party has chosen to exploit the difficulties in the health service in a negative, simplistic and unfairly peronsalised fashion. I say to Deputy McManus that this is only a personalised attack on the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and is not for the benefit of the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facile tactic of putting down a no confidence motion of this nature contributes nothing towards a serious constructive debate on the <Col N="1123" /> realities which any Minster for Health and Children has to deal with in the effort to provide our people with the kind of health service we all want to make available to them. Last night the Minister, Deputy Cowen, provided a very thorough analysis of the difficulties which exist. As doctors, patients and public we would all love to believe that there is such a thing as an instant quick fix solution to all the problems affecting our health services. We all know in our hearts and souls that there is no such magic solution &ndash; every Deputy who will enter the division lobbies this evening knows that. That is why I deplore the insincerity of the Opposition in this debate. We all accept there are problems not alone in health but in many areas, and it is the responsibility of Government to deal with those problems in as constructive a manner as it can. If there were no problems there would be no need for Government.</P>
    <P>Our health services are being provided with £3.3 billion this year. In 1995 the total health budget under the rainbow coalition was £2.2 billion. In 1996 it was £2.3 billion. We entered Government in 1997 and from that time we have increased the health budget to £3.3 billion, an increase of £800 million. How is it possible for a newspaper to quote Deputy Shatter, as one did this morning, that the Minister is locked in a 1980s time warp of economic recession and that his main political mission is limiting health service expenditure? How can this comment be quoted in a newspaper when we have doubled what Deputy Shatter's Government invested in the health service?</P>
    <P>Health service costs are rocketing all over the world. This is a feature of every health service in Europe, USA, Australia and New Zealand. We are not the only country which faces such a problem. The day we have no waiting lists, medical science will be at a standstill. Britain is constantly forced to overhaul and reform its national health service. Escalating costs are further enhanced by the rapid and, I emphasise, welcome advances in medical science.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the magnitude of the problem &ndash; we had &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; motions in the Minister for Health in 1990 and 1991. At that time the health budget was £1.3 billion. A sum of £2 billion extra has been put into the health service in that short time by successive Governments involving Ministers from all the major political parties.</P>
    <P>Besides trying to cope with normal health services, such as primary care, preventive medicine, geriatric and psychiatric care, paediatrics, mental handicap and so on, it is trying to stretch resources to meet the cost of medical advances and breakthroughs. High technology medicine is now the order of the day. Procedures unheard of ten years ago are now commonplace such is the rapidity of modern medicine.</P>
    <P>Take the example of a patient with arthritis of the hips or the knees, a condition which until relatively recently was accepted as the inevitable degenerative consequence of advancing years. It <Col N="1124" /> is not long ago since I was prescribing Brufen 400 milligrams three times a day and the cost was £3 to £5. It is now seen as a treatable condition but with availability of treatment comes demand. Replacement of joints renders patients mobile again and pain-free. We do not consider the cost nor should we. Who wants to talk about cost, particularly when a patient is well. In 1997, a time when it cost £3 to £5 per prescription, £11 million was spent on 2,502 artificial hip operations, representing an average of more than £4,000 per joint replacement.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of a patient with increasing chest pain and invalidism, a feature of progressive coronary heart disease. There was a time when such patients were told &ndash; I did it myself &ndash; to put a tablet under the tongue, being reassured that they would be all right once they remained at home and never moved out. This disability is no longer acceptable. A patient can be whisked into hospital, his chest opened, the diseased heart vessel bypassed rendering the patient mobile again and pain free. It costs more than £10,000 to £12,000 per operation and over 1,006 such operations were carried out here last year.</P>
    <P>If the heart becomes more and more diseased, then a replacement is now possible. We now have the heart transplant which is commonplace according to Mr. Maurice Nelligan, the cardiac surgeon. In 1997, 12 heart transplant operations were performed at an average cost of £40,000 and that does not take into account the very expensive drugs which are necessary to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. That is a long way from a few tablets under the tongue.</P>
    <P>Kidney transplants are now regarded as commonplace procedures, so commonplace we do not mention them anymore. What may not be known is that renal transplants cost an average of £2,500 and there were more than 348 renal transplants last year at a total cost of more than £1 million.</P>
    <P>Besides kidney transplants, a patient while awaiting a kidney transplant must have renal dialysis, and go into hospital overnight and be treated. Last year we had more than 110 kidney transplants averaging a cost of more than £20,000.</P>
    <P>Liver transplants can restore dying patients to normal active life at an average cost of £40,000 per transplant. This is a small country. We would have done more than 20 liver transplants last year and some 49 bone marrow transplants were carried out at an average cost of £27,000 each. It is a great tribute to our country and to our health service that we were able to do this volume of work in the past year.</P>
    <P>There are now diagnostic procedures, ultra-sound, CAT scans, nuclear magnetic resonance and cardiac catheterisation, new sophisticated procedures which facilitate more accurate diagnosis, but we also must remember the cost. More sophisticated and expensive procedures are coming on stream daily and availability creates demand.</P>
    <P>The more the high technology procedures become available, the greater the demand for <Col N="1125" /> them. When the public sees these items on television and reads about them in magazines, they wonder why they cannot have access to them. Expectations are very high and why should they not be so. With the rate of advances and breakthroughs in medicine, I can see that health costs could outstrip the gross national product in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The blame does not lie with the Minister for Health and Children. The Minister does not stand indicted before the Dáil and the public. He, like any other Minister for Health, is faced with agonising choices, as Ministers for Health the world over are with so many demands on the finite resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The problem arises in that the budget for geriatric, psychiatric and mental handicap care, the so-called Cinderellas of the health service, may become more and more curtailed as more high technology medicine devours increasingly more of the finite health budget but that is not the case even in the Cinderella area. Last year in those areas we spent £270 million up £11.3 million on 1997.</P>
    <P>We, the politicians, stand indicted before the public for failing to spell out the escalating costs of high technology medicine and for failing to educate the public on this subject. We are the people who should be indicted, not the Minister for Health and Children. As I said to Deputy McManus, this is just a personalised attack on the Minister and will not do one iota for the health service.</P>

      <P>The criticism by the Labour Party of our Minister for Health and Children is a futile exercise in negativity, propped up by the Samba band on the Opposition benches. As Minister with responsibility for older people, I emphasise what the Minister has done to enable him and me to improve services for older people by injecting a significant level of additional funding, both revenue and capital, into the system since we came into office in mid-1997 and also in developing a planned, focused and phased programme of overall improvements in our health service.</P>
      <P>Excluding the nursing home subvention scheme, which we will deal with separately, the amounts of additional revenue funding provided to services for older people by the previous Government in the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 were £2.1 million, £2.5 million and £3 million, respectively. In 1998, the additional amount provided by this Government was £7 million and in 1999, the figure was £16 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the nursing home subvention scheme, the annual budget in mid-1997 when this Government came into office stood at £17 million. The allocation in 1999 is £33 million, an increase of almost 100 per cent. So much for our newspapers today. Combining the two lots of figures mentioned, £25 million additional revenue <Col N="1126" /> funding was provided to services for older people in 1999 over and above the 1998 figures.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, this Government has more than doubled the level of capital resources previously made available for health facilities for older people to £14 million in 1998. The investment will accelerate the provision of additional residential care units, rehabilitation, respite care and day care facilities for older people as well as enhancing existing services so that older people and their carers will have better facilities closer to where they live.</P>
    <P>The construction or planning of new community nursing units is under way in places such a Ballyconnell, Virginia, Clonmel, Killybegs, Birr and Achill. A new 50 bed unit will be opened in Dublin this year. Funding was also provided last year for 11 day care centres and in recent days I announced the availability of funding for a comprehensive day care centre in Finglas.</P>
    <P>Funding was provided in 1998 for a range of minor capital works in relation to services for older people in locations such as Dungarvan, Thomastown, Limerick, Ennis, Cork city, Loughrea, Ballina, Clonakilty, Bandon, Dingle, Dunmanway, Macroom, Schull, Castletownbere, Kanturk, Cobh, Clifden, Newcastlewest, Raheen, Castlebar, Athlone and Bellmullet. The capital allocation for 1999 has not yet been finalised but it will exceed last year's figure of £14 million.</P>
    <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People, the statutory advisory body on issues affecting older people, has identified support for older people in the home as well as support for carers as fundamental to improving the quality of life of older people. This is also the consensus view of the various organisations which represent the interests of older people. A number of initiatives have been taken this year which will enable health boards to provide greater support for older people in their homes.</P>
    <P>The home help service is widely recognised as a key service in supporting dependent persons in their homes. Notwithstanding this, it is generally accepted that there are a number of problems relating to its organisation and development which need to be addressed if the service is to realise its full potential. The findings of a report commissioned by the Department which have just been published are being studied. In the meantime steps have been taken to deal with the most immediate problems. A sum of £1.5 million has been earmarked for the development of the service. This will be used to extend its coverage, providing more hours' service, and improve training for home helps.</P>
    <P>Older people should not be deprived of medical care because of inability to pay. In line with its commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government has decided to increase significantly the income guidelines for entitlement to a medical card for those over the age of 70. This improvement will be introduced over three years beginning on 1 March.</P>

An additional £3 million has been allocated to health boards to raise the minimum rate of payment for all home helps to £3 per hour from 1 April. This is part of a phased improvement of rates of payment, the remaining phases to be implemented as resources permit.</P>
      <P>Improvements have been introduced for carers who will receive an additional £6 per week. A sum of £200 will be available towards the cost of respite care. Improvements will also be made to extended care services. Grants to voluntary bodies will be increased while additional geriatricians will be appointed. There will be a new psychiatric service for older people as well as other development programmes. The Minister's hallmark is that he delivers on his promises.</P>

The Opposition and some of the newspapers have been trying to imply that, <Col N="1128" /> because of funding difficulties, there has been a reduction in the level of patient care at the hospital. There will be no such reduction, as has been confirmed by Arthur Stirling who is a member of the board.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that new Labour, perhaps in its first motion in Private Members' time, is engaged in a cynical exercise in political opportunism. It is playing politics with anxious patients awaiting medical treatment, including surgery. It is undermining the confidence of health service personnel who are working hard in difficult circumstances to provide a service. It is seeking cheap publicity at the expense of sick patients, their families and relatives. It is a sick motion which should be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to those who work in the various institutions, hospitals, clinics, day care centres and so on, for which the Minister has responsibility. They are dedicated, highly skilled and highly motivated. I appeal to health board management to improve communication, especially with the families of those awaiting medical treatment, including surgery, in which, perhaps because of misunderstandings, there is often a breakdown.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, on the work he did in reconstructing the regional hospital in Limerick. Under a plan devised in 1995 nine new operating theatres were provided. A sum of £22 million or £23 million has been spent in developing the hospital, including the provision of new out-patient facilities and an intensive care unit. The modernisation programme has been accelerated by the Minister. A sum of £26 million will be spent this year in providing a new paediatric service, which is badly needed, new laboratories and a new accident and emergency department and in modernising the radiology department. Improvements have also been announced in Ennis. This indicates a desire on the part of the Minister to improve the services available in the regions.</P>
      <P>Much of this discussion has centred on Tallaght Hospital which everyone is anxious to see working successfully. However, there have been major problems in the regions. I compliment the Minister on travelling to see the problems at first hand and providing almost £3.5 billion for health services. This is a uniquely large amount of money which, along with improved managment, will boost the delivery of services over the coming years. Instead of condemning the Minister we should be withdrawing the motion and giving him our full backing for the work he is doing.</P>

      <P>This motion is worthy of the sup<Col N="1129" /> port of Deputies on both sides who recognise and are concerned about the chronic state of public health services. The contrast between the resources available to this Minister and the lengthening queues for vital treatment confounds the public. The Labour Party believes the Minister has failed. Given the prosperous state of the nation's finances, the health services should be entering a phase of expansion and improvement. However, with the Minister at the helm we are living through a crisis which has caused severe pressure, particularly on public hospitals. It is time to call a halt to this deterioration and to make a fresh start.</P>
      <P>Last evening I spoke to patients in Beaumont Hospital. One patient informed me that, on average, 27 patients are on trolleys in the accident and emergency department awaiting admission to the appropriate ward. This is the main acute hospital for north Dublin, city and county. This patient also stated that the length of time patients remained on trolleys varied from 16 to 19 hours. This is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I also met a constituent who had brought his 90 year old mother into the A&amp;E department four hours earlier. Hopefully that woman is receiving attention in a ward or has been discharged. This is totally unacceptable in a Christian country.</P>
      <P>Given the pressure on staff, particularly on doctors and nurses, I acknowledge the professional and humanitarian care they provide for all patients. This acknowledgement should be made in a more appropriate way by the Minister and the Government. I could give numerous examples of the problems of waiting lists. For example, young men and women have been waiting for more than ten years for orthodontic treatment, since they were children.</P>
      <P>The following case illustrates the hardship faced by thousands of men, women and children awaiting heart surgery. I will refer to the individual involved as &ldquo;John&rdquo;. In 1976, after a visit to Dr. O'Brien in Jervis Street Hospital, he was diagnosed with blood pressure and mild angina and gave up smoking immediately. In November 1996, he suffered his first heart attack and spent three weeks in hospital. He was informed that he would be taken in at a later stage for an angiogram.</P>
      <P>In 1997, while awaiting an angiogram, &ldquo;John&rdquo; had a second heart attack and was hospitalised for two weeks. He was called for an angiogram after two months which highlighted three blocked arteries leading to the heart. &ldquo;John&rdquo; was informed that he needed heart bypass surgery and was put on a waiting list for the operation at the Mater Hospital. At the same time he was informed that he would not survive another heart attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today, February 1999, this patient is sitting at home in a distressed and breathless condition. He is awaiting the bypass operation having being forced to give up work in 1996. This case is typical of thousands of people who are waiting for urgent <Col N="1130" /> medical treatment. Most of these people have paid their taxes and PRSI contributions over the years and contributed to the upbeat economic climate.</P>
    <P>We should compare their situation with those who can obtain medical care through private health insurance. These people have almost immediate access to the Mater Private Hospital or the Blackrock Clinic. I doubt if they would have to wait two weeks for treatment, let alone two years, which is the norm for public patients.</P>
    <P>This is the real world which exists for the majority of people and it cannot be allowed to continue. The Minister's attitude is unacceptable. He continuously states that he is putting more money into health in 1999 than ever before. However, the facts show that since he took office waiting lists have jumped from 30,000 to 35,000 at a time when the coffers of the Department of Finance have never been so full or when finance has never been as readily available for the few rather than for the majority.</P>
    <P>As Labour spokesperson on older persons' issues I am deeply concerned at the lack of residential and other long-term care facilities for older people in need of important, if non-acute, care. This is a major problem which is leading to a substantial blockage in the availability of acute hospital beds. Unless this issue is resolved now when the money is available for much needed capital investment, the situation will get infinitely worse given the projected increase in the number of older people as we enter the new millennium.</P>
    <P>A number of issues can and should be addressed as a matter of urgency. In many out-patients departments numerous patients are called for the same appointment time. It is not unusual to see 15 or 20 people waiting for the same time resulting in large queues. In many cases, elderly people, particularly those living in the city centre and in more rural areas, have to leave home well before their bus passes come into operation in order to make hospital appointments.</P>
    <P>The lack of co-ordination of administration in hospitals results in patients who have to meet other consultants or specialists having to make different appointments on different days. This system needs to be streamlined and reformed. The change in the drug refund scheme recently announced by the Minister and signalled on budget day will mean an additional cost of £10 per month for people who require regular medication. It is scandalous that this will take up the increase in social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>I wish to address the controversy unnecessarily and unfortunately provoked in respect of Tallaght Hospital. I make no comment about the wider range of health issues so comprehensively covered by Deputies except to say that if I was pouring as much money into the health service as the Minister claims to be and the result was an additional 5,000 people on the waiting list, I would be taking a long and hard look at the calibre of managment in the health service, including in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the impression given last night by the Minister that the service plan has been adopted by the Tallaght Hospital board and all is well. This is emphatically not the view on the ground and I refer the Minister to the insightful report in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> by Carol Coulter and to the views of the Tallaght Hospital Action Committee.</P>
      <P>Without being partisan, I am persuaded that a serious miscalculation was made in respect of the funding requirements of a new hospital which comprises the commissioning of three old hospitals with their own traditions and ethos. The funding mechanism was inappropriate for such a new hospital and that was one of the conclusions of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report. It also concluded that capital overruns could not have been avoided. Admittedly, there was a blurring of expenditure in terms of these overruns and the requirements of equipping, furnishing, etc, which were imperatives acknowledged by the Department at the time. The Department knew that the 21 June opening date would not otherwise have been met.</P>
      <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche acknowledges that the management had to spend above budget on capital. However, the Department did not shout stop. Furthermore, I wish to state with a full sense of responsibility that the Department had full knowledge of and left the impression that it acquiesced in the overspend. I am further concerned that having facilitated the considerable achievement of the June opening, the Department sent in the accountants after 105 days. Their remit was supposedly for three weeks. However, the consultancy went on for ten weeks during which a great deal of valuable management time was deflected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a Department which has not distinguished itself in terms of management efficiency, the indecent haste to intrude into the affairs of Tallaght Hospital is curious. I am mindful of the traditional struggle to protect the Adelaide ethos. I recall previous conflicts not between Government and the Adelaide but between the Department and the Adelaide. I hoped the patient accord, put in place by the for<Col N="1132" /> mer Minister, Deputy Noonan, had put that debate to bed. The people of Tallaght and the surrounding catchment area do not want that debate reopened. They want the delivery of quality health care. I profoundly hope that we are not contending with the problems of contrived indebtedness.</P>
    <P>The people of Tallaght do not wish to engage with the Department in a battle for control of the new hospital. I do not implicate the Minister in pursuing such an agenda, but the least he owes to the long standing and long suffering population who have waited 20 years for this hospital is to be alert that he is not being walked into old battles that have no place in the new Ireland. In this regard I am gravely disappointed that the Minister last night gave the impression that all is now well at Tallaght. All is far from well and I hope the Minister knows it.</P>
    <P>The board has been brow beaten into reluctantly endorsing a service plan which a majority do not believe can work. The <i>realpolitik</i> of the situation dictates that they had no choice but to bend the knee to the Department. They have not received the extra £1 million mentioned by the Minister and they believe it will not arrive before April. Services inevitably will be curtailed and a union management meeting scheduled for tomorrow may or may not clarify the staffing position. Meanwhile, there is no reassurance for the distraught parents campaigning to ensure that the paediatric haematology services realise their tremendous potential at Tallaght. Patients being transferred from the Tallaght cardiac catheterisation unit to St. James's Hospital may be at risk in some cases. A total of the 16 unapproved staff working in the sterile supplies department are essential to comply with EU regulations. For these and other reasons, some board members voted against acceptance of the service plan and others abstained.</P>
    <P>We have lost a chief executive of international standing and embroiled a new hospital in unnecessary conflict. Dr. McCutcheon was attempting to build a management team which would manage the successful transition. Given the background, the situation required tact and consultation. Relocating three established hospitals with their own traditions and ethos to a single campus, inevitable start up and commissioning problems and hugely delicate industrial relations and people problems demanded great patience, tact and conciliatory skills. The situation did not require a Minister for Health and Children hurtling around the pitch like an overcharged rugby player, crashing into members of his own team and undermining the team effort.</P>
    <P>The tremendous achievement of Tallaght Hospital derives from the patient, co-operative team effort which the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, should be encouraging and not undermining. It is a pity, for whatever reason, the Minister has chosen to spoil the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar. It was unnecessary that this tremendous new hospital for which the people of <Col N="1133" /> Tallaght waited so long should have been born in conflict and controversy. We can only hope that when this controversy abates, the Minister will change his inflexible approach and respond to the justifiable and reasonable requirements of the new hospital.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the array of Ministers who spoke in support of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, are not present because I wish to respond to some of the comments they made. I assure them and the Minister for Health and Children that this motion is not about play school politics, but serious politics. We are not looking for magic solutions to our problems. We want responses to real problems which have been identified, costed, planned and pleaded for by health boards.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Mid-Western Health Board and we are blue in the face trying to plan for the health needs of our region. We have not received the required response to the extent that a number of the members of the board voted against the service plan this year. For the first time since I joined the health board, including times when I was in Opposition and representative of a Government party, I and other political representatives voted against the service plan. Professional representatives, including doctors and nurses, also voted against it. We are not, as Deputy Daly suggested, undermining the staff in the health care area. Some of them voted against the service plan because we are so aggravated by our efforts to meet the health needs in our region.</P>
      <P>Deputy Daly referred to the paediatric ward. However, we have no guarantee that we will be in a position to open the ward in the new regional hospital because we have not secured funding for it. Another area of need is the regional maternity hospital. It was necessary to send twins from there to Cork although the needs had been costed. Plans had been made and money had been sought.</P>
      <P>We have also sought money for mental handicap services. A total of 76 residential places and 81 day care places are required. We have received money for 19 residential places and 17 day care places. I am aware of the case of an elderly man who is on a waiting list. He is 84 years of age and at the top of the list. However, he has been told that all the people on the waiting list must be reassessed because it has grown so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party said it would reduce the waiting lists as a priority, but instead, the lists have increased by over 5,000. The motion is not electioneering or an attempt to play politics. It is about serious issues for people like me who are members of health boards and who are trying to get a response to proposals which have been costed. Plans have been submitted and funding sought. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, may be interested to know that we have sought funds for children who are being cared for outside the country because they have specific behavioural <Col N="1134" /> needs. We submitted a plan to the Department but we still have not received funding.</P>
    <P>Our service plan asked us to close wards at a saving of £470,000. However, those wards need to be kept open. Sick people in our region need those beds. I understand the point made by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, about medical inflation, growing costs and a growing elderly population. However, we have planned for that situation and we are trying to address it. I urge the Minister to respond to this debate which is not about point scoring or casting aspersions on members of other parties. It is a serious debate about the real needs of people.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. I do not regard it as a personal attack on the Minister and I do not join those who have brought personalities into the debate. However, the state of our health services is such that I cannot but support the motion which represents a lack of confidence in the Government's health policy and the Minister's implementation of it.</P>
      <P>Many Members cited the tens of thousands of people on hospital waiting lists. The figures speak for themselves, but they can never speak as eloquently as the individual men, women and children in desperate need of health care, who are forced to endure pain and anxiety while waiting for attention in our public hospitals.</P>
      <P>Let me cite the case of a young constituent of mine who has suffered from tonsillitis for a long time. It has made life a misery for her. Her future career prospects have been affected because she has had to suspend her studies due to the debilitating nature of her condition. She requires a simple straightforward operation to remove her distress, yet she is told she must wait another year before getting that operation.</P>
      <P>I received a copy of a letter to another of my constituents from a surgeon. He writes to the family doctor of this three year-old child, again describing the severe symptoms of tonsillitis, from which she suffers. Once again a simple operation could end her and her distraught family's ordeal, but she too must wait. At the end of the letter the surgeon notes that he can arrange for the operation to be done privately.</P>
      <P>Tonsillitis is not a life-threatening condition. It does not require hugely expensive care or complicated surgery. However, in a period of unprecedented economic prosperity, this State cannot manage to provide the resources to treat it promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case we see exposed the inequality at the very heart of our health service. Neither this Minister nor any of his predecessors have seriously challenged this inequality. It is an absolute obscenity that in Ireland in 1999 a person with sufficient financial resources of their own or with sufficient borrowings can walk past the queues in our public hospitals and receive immediate care, often within those same institutions and from the <Col N="1135" /> same consultants. Health is for sale as a commodity in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>The debacle of Tallaght Hospital has been mentioned by many speakers. I wish to mention briefly one aspect of it. Parents of children suffering from leukaemia have been forced to come together to resist the threat from the Minister for Health and Children to close down the haematology and other units in Tallaght and move them to Crumlin children's hospital. The Minister's handling of this issue has been appalling. He refused to respond to the parents for three months and only met them last week after their newly-formed campaign group CHILD received nation-wide publicity. This group of parents is totally disillusioned with the Minister's approach. Their anger and disillusionment is shared by patients and staff across the health services. They have no confidence in the Government's ability to manage the services on which the health and well-being of their children depends. I must concur with their judgment and support this motion.</P>

        <b>:</b> I will be voting against the Government in tonight's vote. That is not because of the personality of any particular Minister but because of the way the health service is administered and the philosophy that is allowed to dictate the way it is administered.

We have a health service that is very unequal indeed in the way it treats people who are wealthy, people on average incomes and poor people.</P>

        <b>:</b> I propose to share that time with Deputy Gormley.</P>
      <P>Private health care is allowed to develop and encouraged in some quarters to the detriment of those who are unable to afford it. The health service is the subject of a major rip-off, and that is why there is a tightening of the lid on the public sector of the service. Consultants in the private area are ripping off the health service big-time by the huge incomes they receive from limited resources and in the way they organise their business. The health service is the subject of a massive rip-off by pharmaceutical and health supply companies, and this is not being investigated by the Government. The rip-off of the health service by the drug supply sector is nothing short of a scandal &ndash; pills and so on that cost a few pennies to develop are allowed to be sold for pounds to fatten the profits of private multinational companies. These are some of the issues that should be challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may tell us the amount of money being spent on the health service, but as a percentage of gross domestic product it is one of the <Col N="1136" /> lowest in the European Union, and has slipped considerably in recent years. The facts bear that out.</P>
    <P>It is particularly nauseating to see private medical insurance companies coming on the scene, and the way these people sell their intervention into the health service, using terms such as &ldquo;products, &ldquo;packages&rdquo; and so on. In other words, nursing care, medical care, the care and attention that people who are sick or old need is reduced to a crude product to be marketed just as one might market a soap powder. These people should be booted out of the health service area. We need a comprehensive, public, democratic health service that is equally accessible to all our people. The resources could then be redistributed and new resources found to create a situation where we did not have the crisis of waiting lists and crises such as we see in Tallaght at present. The Tallaght Hospital Action Group must be weary that they have to go to the barricades again after their tremendous fight to get the hospital in the first place. They should get the full support of the Dáil.</P>

    <P>I intend to speak on a very important issue. If the Minister wishes to heckle, he can. The question I wish to raise concerns the haematology unit <Col N="1137" /> at Tallaght Hospital. The Minister is aware of this issue, but I do not know whether he understands the heartache it is causing parents and the suffering it is causing many of the children.</P>
    <P>We have a state-of-the-art hospital in Tallaght. We have this haematology unit there and the expertise. However, it is suggested that it be moved to Crumlin children's hospital. Tallaght Hospital is fully accredited. International trials are taking place there. It is a fact, credited in independent reviews, that children attending such a facility have a 10 to 15 per cent better chance of survival. This is reason enough to maintain that unit in Tallaght. I ask the Minister to address that issue directly tonight because it is giving rise to grave concern among parents.</P>
    <P>The impression now is that the money given to Tallaght Hospital comes with strings attached and that the individual ethos which was part of the Adelaide is being undermined. The Minister must address that.</P>

      <P>Deputy McManus's main argument, that the Minister was only concerned with accounting and accountability rather than the quality of patient care, is as false as it is grossly unfair to the first Minister for Health and Children to undertake a fundamental reform of health services. He is the first Minister to have taken on the old habits and prejudices of a lifetime. He has addressed the old demand-led structures where those who shouted loudest got the most.

      <P>Compare this to the totally inadequate £400 million allocated by the then Minister for Finance, now Labour Party leader, Deputy Quinn, between 1995 and 1997. In three budgets, Deputy Quinn had more than £40 billion to allocate. Why was the Labour Party not so concerned then about the health services? Why did it not put money towards the waiting lists then? Why in its period in Government did it reduce the funding for the waiting list initiative from £12 million to £8 million in one year? Perhaps Deputy Quinn, when replying, can explain why the only specific initiative for public patients was reduced by a Government of which the Labour Party was a member and which claimed to be socialist.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party and Fine Gael must feel a sense of shame in the way they have run away from the 1996 accountability legislation which they introduced when in Government. It is the chaos resulting from this legislation which has bedevilled the development of a modern caring health service. All the Labour Party can offer in this debate is a return to the old days. How can there be quality patient care without accountability? How could we return to the days of the then Minister for Health, Barry Desmond, in 1986, when the Labour Party ignored every principle of accountability? In that year Barry Desmond allowed an overrun of £35 million on the health services.</P>

      <P>If we had allowed that percentage increase of an overrun last year, it would have meant a budget deficit in last year's figures of a whopping £85 million. Under the accountability legislation which the Labour Party introduced, this would mean a first charge on the 1999 budgets of health boards and hospitals and would result in £170 million being taken out of services. What kind of perverse logic is it from Deputy McManus and Deputy Shatter that demands of a Minister for Health and Children that he concedes everything to the loudest voices and to the most organised special interest groups, thereby damaging quality health care across the spectrum which the Opposition pretends to care so much about?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in Cabinet with the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and have worked with him, so I have no doubts about his ability. We have only one out of every four slots for Private Members' time, so when we decided to use that time, we were doing so against a background of parliamentary scarcity. We did not choose something which was not a serious issue but something which was not just of concern to the Labour Party and people in the Chamber but also something which was a serious problem beyond. We do not have political confidence in the Minister for Health and Children because neither he nor his Department is doing a good job. I heard him on the radio this morning talking about the increase in resources. That compounds the criticism because alongside the increase in resources has been an increase in the waiting lists. The Minister consistently evaded the question put to him by Richard Crowley. While we unfortunately do not have political confidence in him, it is not personal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make another observation which could be <Col N="1140" /> construed as being personal but do not wish it to be taken so. I am amazed that a Minister for Health and Children in whom a motion of no confidence has been tabled in Private Members' time is not directly supported in the Chamber by the Secretary General of his Department. The ongoing row in the Department, where one senior Assistant Secretary has not spoken to the Secretary General for more than a year, is a clear indication that the Minister cannot do his job, even if he wanted to. There is a crisis in the Department of Health and Children where a breach of promise relating to promotions ended up in court, where senior civil servants, in an unprecedented manner, testified against each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Attack me, not the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is politically responsible for the running of the Department and both he and the Minister for Finance should not have allowed that case to go to court. It is a matter of fact and public record that people legally testified against each other.</P>
      <P>We have been in Government together in the past and have done things, some of which we would have preferred to have done better. The Minister is speaking to a party which has the experience of Government and which knows what happens when a Department does not function properly or completely. Part of the difficulty for which he has political responsibility is the management of the Department of Health and Children and the way it relates to the rest of the health infrastructure which is immensely complex to administer. Anyone who knows anything about the politics of medicine and health in any OECD country will concede that.</P>
      <P>One classic example of where the internal failure of the Department of Health and Children under the Minister's stewardship hit reality, taking into account the legacy of problems from the past which he inherited, was the way in which the Tallaght Hospital was established and the fact that the original budget was not realistic. The failure consequent to that is what created the crisis in Tallaght which has already been referred to and about which Deputy Rabbitte and others spoke.</P>
      <P>We are not engaging in any type of personal vendetta against the Minister or any other individual. The Minister of State may take some comfort in that kind of criticism, but that is not the case. We are saying there is a crisis in our health service that has been failed, in terms of the resolution, by the actions taken so far by the Government. It is because that failure is so manifest and because we are hearing about it in our clinics and reading about it in our newspapers&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank everybody who has contributed to the debate. It is an unusual step to propose a vote of no confidence in a Minister but it is clear that our health services are in a serious crisis when there is such consensus across a wide range of parties on the need for a fresh initiative in the health care area.</P>
      <P>This is not a personalised attack, it is something much more serious than that. The Minister made a lengthy contribution in which he trawled through his Estimates to highlight every project, hospital extension and other spending to impress us.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable amount of money is involved and it would be extraordinary if it were any other way. If there had not been a significant increase in health spending in a time of such prosperity we would not be looking for a vote of no confidence in one Minister but in the entire Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The achievement of this Minister has been that while he obtained the increase in spending power, the increase is more than matched by an increase in hospital waiting lists. That failure to save lives and alleviate suffering gives us the power to challenge the premise by which this Minister is in office. We do not know the true extent of the <Col N="1142" /> waiting lists; we only have figures up to September. Before Christmas, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association estimated that the figure is increasing to 40,000.</P>
    <P>In my contribution last night I raised important points with the Minister, including the issue of hospital waiting lists. Unfortunately, the Minister was not willing to join me yesterday morning on the radio &ndash; instead he spoke on the radio this morning.</P>

It was noted that the number had dropped, which is welcome, but the reason one name is off that list is because that person, Baby Murphy, who last August was promised by the Minister that he would have his operation, never made it to the operating theatre because he died. Others have died, small babies, young adults and adults who were entitled to expect the best treatment this country can provide but which this Government and this Minister failed to provide.

I represent west Wicklow, along with Deputy Mildred Fox. Will the Independents be able to explain what is happening to their constituents in Baltinglass, Blessington and Dunlavin who access facilities at Tallaght Hospital, the parents of children with leukaemia? How can any Deputy ask people to support what is happening in Tallaght when there is an opportunity for the Independents to use their muscle and for the Minister for Health and Children to seize this unique opportunity presented to him in these prosperous times? At the same time there is a failure in the system, which is the responsibility of the Minister and his Department, which is leading to some people losing their lives and to others living in unnecessary pain and suffering.</P>

    <Title>Agenda 2000: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the agricultural aspects of the Agenda 2000 proposals. We are at the critical stage of the negotiations. The Council of Agriculture Ministers will meet in Brussels next Monday and the meeting is likely to continue for most of the week. The German Presidency is determined to try to reach agreement on CAP reform at the meeting. Whether it will be successful in achieving that objective remains to be seen, but one way or another we are coming closer to the stage when far-reaching decisions, which will be vital for the future of Irish agriculture, will be taken.</P>
      <P>The European Council meeting in Bonn on Friday, 26 February is scheduled, among other things, to consider the outcome of the Agriculture Council meeting. In any event the European Council meeting in Vienna last December confirmed that political agreement on the Agenda 2000 package as a whole should be reached no later than the end of next month. It is precisely because the decisions to be taken are of such major importance that I have devoted such a high priority to forcefully putting Ireland's case at successive meetings of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. I have also used every opportunity to put Ireland's case in a series of bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and with my ministerial colleagues. I have consulted widely here in order to get the best advice and input and I will come back to these contacts in greater detail later.</P>
      <P>Statements on the Agenda 2000 CAP reform proposals were last taken in the House on 27 November 1997. At that stage we had only outline proposals on the table and I indicated that my concerns were that the reforms should be carried out in a way which ensured that the principles of the CAP were preserved, the interests of member states should be taken into account in a balanced way and, above all, the incomes of farmers and the viability of rural communities should be fully protected.</P>
      <P>These remain my concerns, but the detailed proposals for CAP reform which the Commission presented in March 1998 disappointed me greatly as they contained major changes, by reference to the outline proposals of July 1997, which would adversely impact on Ireland. The more significant changes which affect us are the reduction of beef premia to create the national envelopes; reductions in our male beef premium ceiling and suckler cow premium rights; the abolition of beef intervention and its replacement by a scheme of aids to private storage and an increase from 10 to 15 per cent in the price reduction for milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these changes involve a loss of one kind or another for Ireland. In addition, the Commission put forward other changes from which Ireland does not gain, including the allocation of milk quota to mountainous regions, the restoration of <Col N="1151" /> the maize silage subsidy and changes in the beef extensification measures. The balance of the proposals, therefore, changed significantly for Ireland between July 1997 and March 1998.</P>
    <P>I accept that European agriculture has to be positioned to cope with the rapid changes taking place both in agriculture and society in general. I agree that, in particular, it has to be ready to meet the challenges which will inevitably arise from the enlargement of the Union and the next round of the World Trade Organisation negotiations, which are due to commence before the end of the year. However, since the proposals emerged, I have made it very clear at meetings of the Council of Agriculture Ministers that the proposals in their present form would seriously damage Irish agriculture and the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>From the outset I indicated in the strongest manner my concerns about the effect of the proposals on Irish farmers' incomes and about the lack of equity between member states and different types of production. I have also taken every opportunity to put this case in bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and ministerial colleagues, most recently when meeting the Commissioner in Dublin earlier this month and again in bilateral discussion with him and the President of the Council, German Minister, Herr Funke, in Brussels yesterday. The Taoiseach has also put forward this point of view in his bilateral discussions on Agenda 2000, most recently with President Chirac and Prime Minister Jospin in Paris and Prime Minister Kok in the Hague this week.</P>
    <P>It is significant that I obtained acknowledgement of the importance of the beef and milk sectors to Ireland by having written into the conclusions of the Agriculture Council last May a statement that the dependence of particular member states on specific sectors would be taken into account in the final agreement. The beef and milk sectors account for 70 per cent of the Irish agricultural output and 4 per cent of Irish GDP. This is not the case in any other member state, or even remotely so. Each of these sectors is more important to our economy than the entire agriculture sector is to nine other member states. Through the conclusions agreed at the May meeting, the Council has recognised that major Irish economic interests are at stake in the CAP reform negotiations and I intend to ensure that this recognition is honoured by the Council.</P>
    <P>The 30 per cent price reduction and the supply control measures proposed for the beef sector by the Commission go far beyond what is needed to restore market balance and will fall disproportionately on extensive producers. It is possible to achieve market balance through lower price reduction and a different approach to supply controls. I put forward proposals for a solution along those lines to the Commission and my colleagues on the Council.</P>
    <P>Another issue of major importance to Ireland is the level of compensation in the beef sector. <Col N="1152" /> The Commission proposals aim to shift the balance of compensation in favour of intensive production. I have stressed the need for changes to be made to favour extensive production and that a satisfactory outcome to this crucial issue is essential. It is also central that an effective intervention system is retained to ensure that, in the event of temporary market disturbances, it will be possible to provide a floor in the market. That situation was seen last autumn when, despite that fact that we got increases in export refunds and private storage, it was necessary to introduce intervention. It had a stabilising effect on the market. It is critically important for Ireland, which has such a dependence on export markets to third countries and is so vulnerable to them, to have intervention retained.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty in the beef negotiations is that there is a perception among other member states that Ireland fared well out of the 1992 reforms. I pointed out that in 1992 the Council decided deliberately to encourage extensive production and structured the premium system accordingly. It was not surprising, therefore, that Ireland, where 99 per cent of beef is produced extensively, benefited from the premium system. I also pointed out that extensive production is a low profit production system and our beef prices are as much as 25 per cent below European levels.</P>
    <P>We only have to look at the annual report from Teagasc on incomes to see that incomes in the beef sector are among the lowest of any farming enterprise. We do not have the benefit of maize silage and lower cereal prices which benefit more intensive production systems. If those were taken into account the perception that Ireland receives proportionately more per kilogramme of beef would be found to be erroneous.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposals in the milk sector also give rise to difficulties for Ireland. They involve a 15 per cent price reduction and compensatory premia, which would only compensate for 60 per cent of the price reduction. This inadequate compensation is unacceptable. The proposals also involve a milk quota increase of 2 per cent at EU level but the proposed allocation of this increase between member states is uneven, unfair and unacceptable. Ireland's share amounts to a 1 per cent increase, while some other member states receive increases of up to 8.4 per cent. This is clearly discriminatory and will not be accepted.</P>
    <P>Reform of the milk sector is not necessary at this stage and we should not embark on changes that would be both expensive &ndash; at about 2 billion ECUs per annum &ndash; and of limited benefit in terms of trade liberalisation. I would prefer to see the current régime continuing for the present but with provision for a review, in say 2003, in the light of developments at WTO and on world markets.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that if a quota increase is to be part of a final agreement, Ireland will not accept any discrimination against us in its allo<Col N="1153" /> cation. In other words, we will demand our fair share of allocation, which is priority allocation, as was written into the 1984 agreement to introduce the milk quota system. We will hold the Council of Ministers to that and ensure they honour that declaration.</P>
    <P>On arable crops, the compensation being proposed for the 20 per cent price cut is clearly inadequate. I am seeking to have this redressed, as well as maintaining the separate base area for maize. It is clearly very important that we get a separate maize area because, if we do not, any increase in maize production would eat into our cereal production quota.</P>
    <P>On rural development, we support the Commission's proposals, although significant changes are necessary, particularly a widening of the range of eligible activities to include research, advice, training and promotion. That is critically important for Ireland. Teagasc provides a very important research function. It also provides a very important training function. Almost all young farmers have a green certificate and training provided by Teagasc. An Bord Bia has also been supported in its promotional activities under these funds. We need that research, training and promotion to continue. I will demand that the Commission proposals be widened to include those activities.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the impact of the reform proposals on the sheep sector. That sector is left out of the proposals entirely, as if it did not exist. Sheep production is a very important sector of Irish farming &ndash; about 36,000 or 37,000 farmers are provided with an income from sheep farming. There are not any circumstances under which a proposal to reduce, for example, supports for beef by 30 per cent, which is the present proposal, would not impact on the sheepmeat sector &ndash; it would be bound to have an impact. I have expressed my concerns about the flaws in the sheepmeat régime. I have pointed out that the consequences of the reform proposals for the beef sector would make the sheepmeat situation even worse. We have the anomaly whereby sheep are counted for stocking density, and yet there is no extensification premium for them. Sheepmeat producers are getting a raw deal in these proposals. I have insisted at every opportunity that sheep be included in the final deliberations.</P>
    <P>A complicating factor in the negotiations is the future funding arrangements for the CAP. A report on EU financing arrangements was published by the EU Commission last October. This report addressed the complaints by some member states that the burden of their net contributions is excessive.</P>
    <P>One of the options put forward by the Commission to redress the balance was co-financing of direct payments to farmers by the EU and member states. My position is unequivocal on this. Co-financing is completely unacceptable to me and to the Government. At last month's Council of Agriculture Ministers' meeting I pointed out that the Common Agricultural Policy <Col N="1154" /> has been built up over 40 years on three central principles &ndash; market unity, Community preference and common financial responsibility &ndash; and that it has contributed enormously to the solidarity which has cemented the Community over the years. For these reasons, we cannot now begin to dismantle that achievement to provide a partial answer to a problem that goes far beyond the CAP.</P>
    <P>While I am reasonably confident that, in the light of the discussions at that meeting and in other fora, the Irish views &ndash; shared by some other member states &ndash; on co-financing will prevail, there is no doubt that a majority of member states favour a tighter budgetary framework for CAP reform. In this connection, a number of member states have put forward options for the stabilisation of expenditure on the CAP.</P>
    <P>In addition, France has put forward the concept of degressivity, that is, the reduction of direct payments to farmers by a certain percentage annually. This concept now appears to have the backing of a significant number of member states and even of the Commission itself, although the Commission has not yet put forward a formal proposal. I am concerned that degressivity will impact more on those sectors, such as beef, which are more dependent on direct payments and less, or not at all, on those sectors where direct payments are small or even non-existent, such as the wine sector. Degressivity could, therefore, give rise to distortions as between sectors, regions and member states and Ireland would be disproportionately affected.</P>
    <P>I will stress that if degressivity is to be applied, the different circumstances of each sector will have to be taken into account. It will also have to exclude small scale producers and, in the event of its being applied, I will seek an exemption limit as high as possible to exclude as many Irish producers as possible. For example, the current proposals suggest that those farmers who do not get more than 5,000 euros, or about £4,000, will be excluded. That is obviously too low a limit. I have asked the Department to do a number of studies of limits of 5,000, 7,500, 10,000, 12,500 and 15,000 euros so that we can be certain of the number of farmers who would be affected by this proposal.</P>
    <P>While it is clear from what I have said that stricter budgetary discipline will apply, I will insist that the resources available must be adequate to fund a worthwhile and equitable reform. I have already emphasised that there is no point in carrying out a reform that is inappropriate, simply to save money.</P>
    <P>Throughout the negotiations, I have been mindful of the need to consult as widely as possible here at home about the implications of the Commission's proposals and on alternatives to them. Since mid-1997 I have had regular consultations with as wide a number of people as possible. That is why I set up four consultative groups last Easter, to which farmers, processors, academics and other interested persons were appointed. I was also conscious of the value of <Col N="1155" /> direct consultations with the farm organisations; I met the four farm organisations this morning in preparation for next week's crucial Council meeting. All these consultations have been very helpful in enabling me to gauge the strength of opposition to these proposals by Irish producers and the Irish agriculture industry.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism from the Leader of the Opposition of my decision to establish the four consultative groups on the grounds that the members of the groups represented vested interests. This is an extraordinary criticism. In the first place, it ignores &ndash; and indeed insults &ndash; the many members of the consultative groups who are there because of their professional standing as academics and researchers. Second, this criticism is based on the assumption that policy can be formulated in a vacuum without any input from people involved in the industry, that is, without an input from farmers and processors. I wonder where the Leader of the Opposition is coming from or on what planet he is living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is enormous expertise in the Department of Agriculture and Food and in institutions such as Teagasc and the universities, the expertise acquired from earning a living in the industry must also be brought to bear. Certainly, people from the industry have special interests but they also have expertise. They have to get up in the morning and earn a living from agriculture. Any politician worth his or her salt should be able to distinguish between special interests and expertise. I would listen very attentively to a person making a living from a particular area of activity, such as farming.</P>
      <P>I have set out for the House the present state of play and indicated the type of changes I am seeking to have incorporated in the final agreement. My main objective will be to secure an agreement that will contain lower price reductions and higher compensation &ndash; by which I mean full compensation &ndash; for the three sectors of beef, milk and arable crops, and a non-discriminatory, fair and equitable allocation of any increase in milk quotas. We are entitled to priority in any additional quotas. That will be done together with other changes that will be favourable to the development of Irish agriculture. We want to lead into the next century with a much needed improvement in morale, particularly after the past seven or eight months of difficult prices and adverse weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to be as frank as possible in regard to these negotiations. I have shared all the pro<Col N="1156" /> posals and our papers in relation to them with the social partners, farmers and their representative associations. I am still negotiating on these reforms. Nothing has been conceded and no decisions have been made. Next week will be the first time since negotiations began that we will get down to serious detail. I look forward to a constructive debate this evening on the issues involved. I will be very happy to take on board any suggestions which will assist me and our most important natural resource industry in next week's crucial negotiations.</P>

In spite of the fact that the Minister's record has been extremely poor at home, I hope he will be re-energised when he gets to Brussels. I hope he will not find it as difficult to deal with his EU colleagues as his Government colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance. He has not been very successful in obtaining Cabinet approval for the measures required for Irish farmers. That is the only criticism I will make. The Minister's voice has been an extremely lonesome one at the Cabinet table and rural Ireland has not seen the desired results.</P>
      <P>As far as Agenda 2000 is concerned, it will be a case of all hands on deck. This is a hugely important time in the lives of every farmer. The effect Agenda 2000 will have on our towns, villages and cities will be immense if things go wrong. The agricultural industry is experiencing terrible difficulties. All sectors, with the exception of the dairying sector, are in decline. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine debated the Irish pigmeat industry today for the first time. In the next four to six weeks, we will hopefully have a decision from Brussels. I hope that by being hurried, we will not be put off side. It is vital that our national interest is looked after, however long it takes.</P>
      <P>We must focus on events at the world trade talks. Fine Gael recognises the need for reform but it is important that any reforms introduced are suitable. Some of the proposals go much too far. I conveyed that opinion to Commissioner Fischler last week although it was difficult to know whether he agreed with me. Some of the proposals, particularly in regard to the beef sector, are completely over the top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formidable challenge we face is something I have not witnessed previously. I accompanied Deputy Deasy during the negotiations on the milk quota in 1983. We must draw a line in the sand beyond which we are not prepared to go. There are two or three measures we cannot accept under any circumstances. It is important that we build up a platform in Europe comprised of agriculture Ministers and heads of state, particularly of bigger countries that experience prob<Col N="1157" /> lems similar to our own. It is extremely important in the last hours of negotiations to have influential people on one's side. I presume the Minister will be working in that regard in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>We have always prided ourselves on the fact that the Germans were very good to Ireland. On this occasion, I believe the French will also be very good to us. Against that background, every political and diplomatic move that can be made should be made to ensure we have important friends in high places when we most need them.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say he would block any attempt at co-financing which is an insidious proposal. It appears to be going off the boil but the possibility remains that the issue might be reintroduced at some stage during the negotiations. If one imagines the German Government with its financial strength deciding to pay a treble suckler cow grant to 2 per cent of its farmers, one can see the competitive edge that would give them over us, given that farmers comprise almost 10 per cent of a population of 3.5 million. Everything I understood the Treaty of Rome to mean under a Common Agricultural Policy would be undermined if co-financing were introduced. Small nations would be downtrodden under those conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the renationalisation of our European markets. I appreciate it may not form part of the negotiations but it is an issue about which I am particularly concerned. I always believed that the cornerstone of the Treaty of Rome was founded on the free movement of goods and services within the member states. The record clearly shows that in countries such as France and Germany, we had good outlets for our products and received prices we could not obtain elsewhere. Because of the country of origin labelling system, we now find ourselves moved off the market. It is very important that our goods be given free access across Europe, particularly in the context of the beef sector. At today's committee meeting on the pigmeat industry, I could not help thinking that some of the problems experienced here relate to imports into the country and the fact that Irish products are not clearly labelled.</P>
    <P>We must draw a further line in the sand on an issue of concern to everyone involved in Irish agriculture and clearly outlined in the IFA document, namely, the issue of compensation. We must receive full compensation for any reforms which occur. We are a long way from that at the moment. We have the daunting task of having to sell 500,000 tonnes of beef every year. That tonnage might be reduced somewhat in the foreseeable future, but it will be something of that order. We export nine out of every ten animals. There are too many cattle in Europe and it is arguable there are too many cattle in Ireland. Based on a management supply control system, if there was a small reduction in cattle numbers across Europe and other measures were taken, and having regard to the fact that we export more cattle than <Col N="1158" /> any other member state of the European Union, that would create space on the markets of other member states. It is important to monitor this area in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>To rebalance the market, I was told it was necessary to reduce our national herd of cows from 12 million to 10.3 million. In our circumstances farmers producing top grade cattle cannot be asked to produce beef at 60p per lb. If that happened, farmers would lose interest in their businesses. They would know before they begin to rear an animal that it will die in debt and a large proportion of the cheque in the post would go only towards ensuring they break even. That proposal is not a runner.</P>
    <P>The maize subsidy will create havoc from a competitive point of view. I have a list, which I do not have time to go through, on which Ireland is placed at the bottom of the league. We produce very little maize. Maize to a continental farmer is what silage is to an Irish farmer. If farmers were paid £100 to £150 an acre under such a scheme, we would be at a major disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal for the suckler cow quota. The proposal for the super levy on suckler cows is interesting. I had not thought there were as many suckler cows outside the quota in Europe or in Ireland. That proposal may be a runner. From Commissioner Fischler's point of view, if the price of beef is reduced to 60p per lb, there will not be any problem rebalancing the system because many farmers would want to get out of farming at that stage.</P>
    <P>We must radically review our beef industry.  We must market our industry. We have said that for years, but we have not done it. This time around we will be given only one chance. Under those conditions we must find the niche markets. We must develop the Belgian Blue for Italy and the Limousin for France. This will have to be undertaken by our AI stations and breeding centres and any bulls or semen used will have to be of the highest quality. I am sure the Minister will not have to spend much time convincing farmers of the need this time. It pays to have quality. Any farmer with a weanling fit for export last autumn was able to get £100 or £150 more than for an animal that could not be exported, and the difference came down to quality.</P>
    <P>We would give anything to open up the live cattle trade with Libya, Iran or Egypt, but we must accept that those markets are unstable. We found that out to our cost. We must ensure in future we a sell top quality product at the highest price in the European Union. That is the foundation for the future of our beef industry.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that crises such as the BSE crisis upset our business, but a window of opportunity has opened. I would not have any problem with developing the industry to export top quality live weanlings. Free trade means that if we have something to sell which somebody in Europe wants to buy we can sell it to them. However, we should ensure every animal kept there is of <Col N="1159" /> sufficient quality, and that we have sufficient quantity to meet our needs.</P>
    <P>Heifers and sheep should be included in extensification proposals. The Minister will have to engage in serious negotiations on stocking densities. If proposals are agreed and sheep are not included we will not be able to do anything about it, but it will not be the hill sheep farmers who will suffer but the best lowland producers in Wexford, Cork and Galway. On a farm where there are cattle and sheep and extensification at £80, farmers will do their sums and will move the sheep off their farms. I can see huge trouble in that. The Minister will have to take a stand on this as many of the 45,000 farmers who have sheep also have cattle. This proposal could be bad news for many of them. This is one of the most insidious proposals I have heard, even though it is not written into the proposal.</P>
    <P>With regard to rural development we will have to put up a fight for the cereal sector. Our cereal industry is extremely important not only for those directly involved, but it has a knock-on effect on the livestock, pig and poultry industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister put on record that in regard to the milk quota a deal for us was mooted. What happened in Brussels on a night in 1983 was registered. That should be taken into account. If there is to be an increase in the milk quota we want to get our share. We were promised it and are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>The European model of agriculture is supposed to distinguish us from other regions of the world. That is one of the reasons we are members of the club, known as the European Union. I was in Argentina recently, I also visited rural America and I have seen what happened in New Zealand and Australia. While it is true farmers there farm without subsidies, I did not meet a farmer who had under 1,000 acres who was able to make a living. I met farmers with 5,000 acres and even 10,000 acres. If our membership of the European Union means anything, we would want to be in a position to protect the livelihoods of the highest possible number of farm families. We all know some farm families will move off the land and while it is difficult to gauge the number, it could be large. We do not want to introduce measures that would entice people to move away from rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that we maintain as many farmers as possible, whether full-time or part-time, in rural Ireland. We must also ensure industry is restructured in such a way that it will attract people to live in rural Ireland. If we want to suck the vitality out of rural areas, all we need do is allow the people to leave them. They were not able to hold that in the countries mentioned. I am a bit disappointed with the rural development section which refers to consolidating the existing regulations, namely, those concerning accompanying measures, less favoured areas and socio-structural measures, into one global regulation. The section has <Col N="1160" /> many proposals but there is no accompanying estimate to back them up.</P>
    <P>Regarding intervention I agree entirely with the Minister. It would be a retrograde step for us if the intervention system was scrapped. A few days after the BSE episode, people stopped eating meat. However, six, eight or ten weeks later the same people were eating meat. What would farmers be expected to do in the meantime if there was no intervention? The system of aids to private storage has not worked in Ireland and never will.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a daunting task. I hope it will be possible for young farmers to see an opening to ensure farming is sufficiently attractive for them to make a career in the sector. I am a bit disappointed with installation aid. I thought the Minister would make a case <i>vis-à-vis</i> Structural Funds for co-financing and would pay a reasonable amount of installation aid consistent with the present. The amount the Minister is providing from Government funds is what young farmers had to take in 1984 or 1985. Surely we must have progressed from that. The Fine Gael proposal of a payment of £12,000 is much more in line with the current situation provided it is co-financed from Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Labour Party on this extremely important debate. Decisions are about to be made in Europe which will leave an indelible mark on the face of rural Ireland. I assure the Minister that the Labour Party will give him our full support as he sets about securing what we hope will be the best possible deal for agriculture. This matter transcends party political interests. It is about a vital national interest. At the end of the day we will support the Government which is committed to a deal that will ensure the maintenance of the maximum number of farm families on the land in rural areas and a sustainable income for these families.</P>
      <P>This is a tough task as there are many people in Europe who believe we were major beneficiaries of the MacSharry farm proposals in 1992. Many of these people feel we got certain benefits which were not available to other countries. This perception, which totally misconstrues the proposals, emanates from people who have no knowledge of our economy, that beef is ten times more important to our economy than to our European counterparts. It shows no knowledge of the percentage of GDP involved, of the fundamentals of CAP reform or the manner in which the CAP came into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been three core principles in relation to CAP. Article 36 of the European Treaty refers to market unity, Community preference and common financial responsibility, but these have gone out with the wind. Many European countries have used every trick in the book to pay lip service to these principles which are more observed in the breach than in the spirit. I have spoken many times in the House about the <Col N="1161" /> problem of renationalisation. The EU labelling requirements establishing the country of origin have been utilised by countries to ensure the exclusion of products from shelves which had a right to be there under articles of the treaty which refer to the free movement of goods and persons. This is one of the great disappointments in this debate. Why are we not conquering the shelves in Europe? Why is only one UK multiple stocking Irish beef while there is virtually no product in French supermarkets? The answer is clear: it is because of the EU labelling regulations which promote the country of origin.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Electricity Regulation Bill I recently said in the House that we have been over-concerned about strict adherence to everything laid down by Europe. We take everything that comes from Europe, hook, line and sinker. We transpose 100 per cent of every directive and regulation. Very often there is a failure to tailor regulations, directives and other European legislation to our particular needs. There is a major failure in this context. Somebody shouted across the Chamber that I was a Euro-sceptic. That was not the first time I made those points, and if that is Euro-scepticism, so be it.</P>
    <P>The French, Germans and Dutch ensure their country's products are promoted at all costs. They do not do so in an overt fashion. Deputy Connaughton is correct. Today we spoke about the pig industry which is a glaring example of how to succeed. However, over the past 12 to 15 months the beef industry suffered in that these countries ensured that Ireland, which has a premier product, cannot get into those markets, despite a scarcity of product. We are producing 7.8 million cattle, a record number. We have a very good product &ndash; great efforts have been made by private producers, farmers and processors over the past couple of years to ensure it is one of the best. A tremendous effort has been made to clean up our act in every way. Yet we are still struggling to secure our market niche which is there to be fought for.</P>
    <P>I have a very strong view on this matter and it should be taken up in the course of negotiations. It must be fought out in the negotiations as once they end the Minister will be told what was accepted and that we must live with it. A starting point would be to ensure that an immediate end is put to any emerging renationalisation trend. The Minister should call for this, as renationalisation undermines the whole basis upon which the European treaties are based and upon which the CAP came into being.</P>
    <P>From the perspective of the Labour Party, it is critical that farm families are put first in the context of these reforms. It is no use bringing forward proposals which help perpetuate the myth that there are a few ranchers doing well in farming. Very often this is seen in Britain where very well-heeled people are doing extremely well because of the manner in which subsidies and premia are allocated. The time may well come &ndash; it may be here already &ndash; for us to be radical.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> In the past two weeks I spoke to a 32 year old farmer who went through agricultural college, who farms 100 acres and is involved in beef production for the domestic market. There are no subsidies or anything of that nature for him. He said he did not think he would ever get married, asking who would take him. The reason was that the level of income he was generating from that enterprise would come nowhere near, as they say down our way, an ass's roar of the average industrial wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Romantic Ireland is dead and gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is dead and gone. I was absolutely taken aback because I have often argued this point in the House. This young man brought it home more forcibly than all the great rhetorical speeches and flourishes which one hears. This was a message from a young person in rural Ireland. It brought home to me the fact that we have been living in an established state of denial as to the extent of the problem.</P>
      <P>We are fighting for the preservation of farm families, for the retention of services and the preservation of the population in rural Ireland. When a population falls below a critical mass, all the economists will say that certain services are no longer needed. That is the critical element in terms of the interaction between farming and agriculture and the rural population in general and the retention of services in rural Ireland, impacting as it does on schools and churches and in terms of keeping Garda stations open and even keeping the local football or camogie teams going. That is how this problem affects rural Ireland. The way these proposals are handled will have a major economic effect. If there is growth in the economy and in urbanisation, the corollary is mass rural degeneration. We have an obligation to ensure the blinds do not come down on rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>If we revisit the CAP reform measures of 1992 introduced by the then Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, the essential thrust of these proposals was to maintain the maximum number of farm families on the land, to supply food at affordable prices for the community at large, to deal with supply and production of grain, beef and milk products, to take care of the environment and to ensure a supply of good quality food. Even the most cursory examination reveals that CAP reform failed miserably in relation to the first two proposals, that is, to maintain the maximum number of farm families on the land and to supply food at an affordable price to consumers.</P>
      <P>Since the MacSharry proposals, we have lost 35,000 farmers. The fear is that if the Agenda 2000 proposals are implemented in their current form, it would change the face of rural Ireland because we would lose about another 35,000 to 40,000 farmers. That would not be in seven or eight years; we could lose them in four to five years, and that is the worry. As Deputy Connaughton said, some people will leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> The reason I called for a national forum on agriculture, wider than the forum about which the Minister spoke, is that it is essential to involve not only primary producers, processors and academics but those who work in the industry because they are important. It is also important to involve the consumers. I was in Argentina and the one thing which was made clear was that there was interaction between the agriculture industry and the consumer which benefited the farming population. It is important not only that we react to policy changes but that we are proactive. We should have a long-term strategy or plan for agriculture and rural development. We see agriculture purely in economic terms and we have failed to develop a social policy for farmers and farming in general.</P>
    <P>We were not able to fill our agricultural colleges 12 or 18 months ago and the numbers have been declining. That gave us a startling bolt in that it indicated that things were not rosy. There were a number of factors outside our control which accentuated this trend and we cannot blame people here for external factors. Nevertheless, the warning signals were there for us in that we should ensure a social policy is developed. That is why I was critical of the Minister in relation to the installation aid scheme.</P>
    <P>We have one of the oldest farming structures with only 12 per cent of our farming population under the age of 35. On average our farmers are about 15 years older than their Australian counterparts. It is critical in trying to maintain the number of farm families on the land that we integrate agricultural education in the agricultural colleges with trade developments because young farmers need every assistance in going back to the land. That is why installation aid was such a critical measure. There should be other ways for young farmers to supplement their incomes. The young farmer I mentioned who has 100 acres in beef heifer production does not believe he will have enough income to marry and bring up a family in rural Ireland. That is a very worrying trend.</P>
    <P>As I said when speaking to IFA executives a week or so ago, the devil is in the detail. We all know the macro figures as regards the 30 per cent, 20 per cent and 15 per cent price reductions with which we can deal. It is the minute detail which can undermine any gains we make at the negotiation table. We know about the co-financing proposal and our alliance with France has proven extremely useful in this regard. However, I worry about what trade offs the French will exact from us in return. We must be very alert because there is no such thing as a free lunch. While we may build up alliances, they should be mutual and common alliances. I do not like their policy of digressivity because, as the Minister said, it would mean many different things to different sectors and areas. They will not mind in that it would impact least on the wine growing areas and most on our products. While it is fine to take co-financing out of the equation, we must <Col N="1164" /> be careful about what parallel developments take place in relation to their negotiating position. That is why I am eager that this matter is fully explained by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In addition to our dependence on agriculture, we are certainly a more insular nation than any other in Europe. We have grass based production and we pride ourselves on our environmentally green and clean image but the thrust of the proposals, as formulated, is to favour intensive producers, basically factory farmers. One of the criticisms I have made all along is that we often took that at face value.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment in recent weeks to establish an expert working group on agriculture. On milk quotas, we are entitled to an increase of 8.4 per cent. This is non-negotiable and should be distributed to small farmers.</P>
    <P>The way in which moneys are distributed should be looked at also. In the last round the beef sector was badly done. There are 100,000 dry stock producers who face desolation unless the method of allocation is changed. There should be tiered payments. According to Ray MacSharry, the system of premiums and subsidies was designed to keep farm families on the land. Some farmers are in receipt of sums as low as £2,500 while others are getting as much as £350,000. The Roscommon study indicates that a slight change would have the effect of increasing incomes by up to 50 per cent. According to the IFA study, conducted by Mr. Jim Phelan, 37,000 farmers have incomes lower than they would receive on the dole. This problem has to be tackled. The Minister will have the unqualified support of the Labour Party in the task that lies ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views of Deputy Penrose on the need to maintain as many farm families as possible on the land. From a rural regeneration and development point of view, every effort should be made to ensure policies are tailored to meet the needs of small and medium-sized producers, without whom rural Ireland would die, and to prevent a continuation of the drift to the east and urban areas.</P>
      <P>It is not often realised that agriculture and the food industry continue to play a huge part in the economy. Some 300,000 work full-time or part-time on farms. The sector accounts for one third of net foreign earnings from trade. Agenda 2000 dominates the horizon. The Taoiseach stated recently, &ldquo;We are not just negotiating for an economic sector, we are negotiating for the incomes of Irish farm families and we are determined to defend the right of Irish farmers to a respectable standard of living&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> I compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister on their efforts to boost our case throughout the European Union. The Taoiseach has discussed our concerns and needs in the context of CAP reform and the Agenda 2000 proposals with the other Prime Ministers. The Minister has discussed our concerns in intensive negotiations over many months.</P>
    <P>When this issue was debated in the House in November 1997 it was thought that the proposals outlined by Commissioner Fischler would prove damaging to agriculture. It is most disheartening that the proposals currently on the table are even more severe. We wish the Taoiseach and the Minister well.</P>
    <P>In excess of £1 billion was paid out in direct payments in 1998. A strong case can be made for a modulated system of payments. It is clear to everyone that they are not targeted properly to make more holdings viable and to preserve more farm families on the land with a proper standard of living. The Minister should argue strongly in favour of a better system. There should be a cut-off point. It is incumbent on the Minister and his officials to highlight the concerns of the farming community about the level of payments.</P>
    <P>A few months ago the Minister addressed a North-South dairy conference in Cootehill. It was disturbing to hear the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Lord Dobbs, speak strongly in favour of doing away with milk quotas. The Minister spoke strongly in favour of their retention. Farmers from Tyrone, Fermanagh and elsewhere in the North were appalled at the efforts of the British Government to do away with quota system which has proved advantageous and should be retained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister on being resolute in their opposition to the Agenda 2000 proposals. I also compliment the farming organisations on the work they have put into their proposals on behalf of farmers.</P>
      <P>In the 1972 referendum 83 per cent voted in favour of membership of the EEC, from which Ireland has gained substantial financial benefits through transfers under the Common Agricultural Policy. Consumers have gained indirectly through the reallocation of Exchequer resources. The Common Agricultural Policy has not, however, succeeded in maintaining farm families on the land or in providing food at affordable prices for consumers.</P>
      <P>In coming weeks decisions will be made which will have major consequences for rural Ireland. These consequences will determine the economic future of the country. Agriculture has always been crucial to the economic and social fabric of Ireland. It also plays a significant role in the economies of Central and Eastern European countries such as Cyprus which will become part of the EU. In such countries it accounts for more than 20 per cent of the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> The Agenda 2000 proposals are designed to address the problems which will ensure enlargement. Despite the fact that the number of consumers will rise to 500 million, enlargement will bring about an even greater surplus in many products. While Ireland accepts the need for reform, farm incomes and rural economies must be protected. Price reductions must be compensated for and compensation must be fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear at meetings of the Council of Ministers that the current proposals would seriously damage Irish agriculture and the economy. He has succeeded in getting an acknowledgement of the importance of beef and milk production to this country. Therefore, the dependence of member states on specific sectors will have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Ireland's beef producers are faced with difficult problems. Ninety per cent of our production has to be exported. Irish beef is almost 25 per cent cheaper than the European price. Production is vulnerable not only to adverse market conditions but also to adverse weather. The sheepmeat sector must also be vigorously defended.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes are not acceptable. The Minister is insisting on a lower price reduction and higher compensation. These changes favour existing production. An effective intervention system must also be maintained to ensure a floor in the market.</P>
    <P>Since 1984 the dairy sector has largely benefited from the quota régime. We must maintain EU milk prices by extending the quota system. The proposed 20 per cent reduction in grain production is unacceptable. Any reduction must be compensated for so that growers' incomes are not reduced. A separate base area, including maize silage, must be maintained. Farmers can rest assured that every possible effort will be made by the Government to protect their livelihoods.</P>

      <P>The song says: &ldquo;Now is the Hour&rdquo;. The Minister is a nice man and I like him but the problem is that he is too nice. We have a problem in Europe in the next few weeks as the Minister is not strong enough. We need negotiators in Europe. When we joined the EEC we were promised much and we gained a great deal from membership. Mr. MacSharry and company have taken 50,000 to 60,000 people out of farming which was a disaster despite all the welcomes he received for the plans at the time. We are going to pay the penalty for that over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not have the support of the Government, the Taoiseach or the Cabinet. We have seen this concerning the fodder scheme and the agriculture crisis here over the past two years. I hope the Minister will take Deputy Deasy to Europe with him next week. When Deputy Deasy <Col N="1167" /> was Minister in the 1980s he fought the Irish case and was probably the greatest Minister for Agriculture we ever had. He was probably the Minister who got most from Europe. At that time he had the support of the Taoiseach of the day. The present Minister does not have that support and that worries me. All parties have offered the Minister their support.</P>
    <P>If ever a Minister needed to wear the green jersey, this Minister must do so next week. We do not want to see the white flag. We want to see the green flag as this is serious business which will determine the future of agriculture for the next ten to 15 years. Young people do not want to get involved in agriculture. Farmers tell us that their sons or daughters will not take the land at any price. That is serious. If the Minister has to use the veto next week to protect our natural industry then he must do so. It was done in the past and it must be done again.</P>
    <P>We have seen how the Americans have bullied half the world. They are now bullying the EU as they want free trade and cheap food. Our farmers must be protected. We cannot expect them to produce beef and sell it below cost. One cannot expect any industry to survive in such circumstances and subsidies will not go on forever. The MacSharry plan sucked us in and now it is going to squeeze us.</P>
    <P>The Minister must fight in Europe. There will be no warm welcome for him if he sells the country down the drain. The IFA marched in 28 centres around the country today. Farmers do not want to have to march. They want to be on the land and doing what they love; looking after their land and their stock. They are marching because they are suffering and I cannot understand why Europe is having a go at Irish farmers when the industry is in such a condition.</P>
    <P>If we have to use the veto it must be used. If the Minister brings Deputy Deasy with him he will see what can be done for farmers. The current proposals on beef and milk are not on. The IFA has lobbied the Minister and all political parties. That organisation knows what it wants and it will not accept anything proposed by the EU. If we do so we might as well close down rural Ireland and forget about the people, the schools, churches and post offices as it will all be over. This is in the Minister's hands. He has the green jersey on and I will be the first to congratulate him if he does a good job. He is a nice man but he is not the man to do the job as he does not have the support of the Taoiseach or the Government who only think of the Dublin 4 brigade.</P>

      <P>The reform of the CAP being negotiated will have a deep and profound influence on the future of Irish agriculture into the next century. The Fischler proposals are for an extension of the CAP reform proposals introduced by Ray MacSharry five years ago. If these proposals are implemented unamended it will mean the net loss of £250 million per annum to <Col N="1168" /> Irish agriculture. When we consider the unprecedented crisis in every sector of agriculture this would be a deadly blow to tens of thousands of farming families and would virtually wipe out farming in the west.</P>
      <P>The basis of the new proposals is a reduction of 30 per cent in the amount of direct subsidy being paid to beef producers. The effects of this on the western seaboard counties would be devastating. The main farming activities in this region are suckler cow and weanling production for beef processors.</P>
      <P>Beef margins are zero now that as little as 74p per pound is being paid by the factories. This compares with £1.27 per pound in January 1985 when Deputy Deasy was Minister. That represents a drop of 50p per pound. In real terms that is more than £1 per pound. Has any other sector suffered such a drastic drop in income during the same period?</P>
      <P>Recent statistics in Donegal indicate that 60 per cent of farmers are over 50 years of age and less than 1 per cent have any third level farming certification. The most likely scenario is that by the year 2005 there will be approximately 3,500 farmers left in County Donegal, 200 of whom will be commercial and the remainder part-time. At present, there are over 8,000 farmers in the county.</P>
      <P>This type of farming structure is guaranteed to reduce the input of agriculture to GDP and will have a devastating effect on the maintenance of the rural population in County Donegal and other western seaboard counties. It would be incomprehensible if the Government supported or in any way allowed these structural reforms in agriculture to be confirmed by the European Commission. The Government's agenda in these negotiations must be to maintain and reinvigorate the rural population of this State. This will involve a focused integration of the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment working to a coherent plan of rural regeneration.</P>
      <P>The American experiment of free market farming, which was much vaunted over the past five to ten years, has proved an unmitigated disaster. The United States Government had to bail out 80 per cent of its farmers with more than $3 billion in aid. We must learn the lesson of this American experience and ensure that the requisite level of subsidies for Irish farmers is maintained over the next ten years. Concurrent with the maintenance of subsidies, a major educational programme is necessary to upgrade the farming skills and management experience of those involved in farming at a primary level. The production of a quality assured, marketable and well presented product will ensure the survival of the maximum number of farmers and also allow agriculture to maintain its vital position in generating total GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a major job to do in the next few weeks. The future of many farming families is in the balance and the result of the Minister's <Col N="1169" /> negotiations in Brussels will determine how they live in the coming years and into the next century. I wish the Minister luck. All eyes will be on him and he must endeavour to get the best bargains possible for agriculture. Farmers have been the salt of the earth and the backbone of the economy for generations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is too serious an issue on which to play politics. It is time the Deputy recognised reality. He should know that the Taoiseach met Mr. Fischler this week and told him that the proposals were not acceptable to the Government.</P>
      <P>If the Commission's proposals were adopted in their current form, farm incomes would be reduced by £260 million a year and there would be a loss of £600 million to the economy. A total of 50,000 farm families would be non-viable within five years and 20,000 non-farm jobs would be lost. These figures were given to us by the IFA in the Shelbourne Hotel last week when we met its representatives. On the basis of those figures, the Fischler proposals must be rejected.</P>
      <P>The debate on Agenda 2000 could not be more timely. The 15 member states of the European Union are engaged in widespread discussions on the policies which will be pursued by the EU post-1999. I wish to put the concept of Agenda 2000 into context. The phrase Agenda 2000 encompasses the reform of various EU policies so that the process of enlargement of the EU can take place in as smooth and streamlined a manner as possible.</P>
      <P>Six countries &ndash; Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus &ndash; have begun accession negotiations with the European Union. These talks are likely to proceed for some time, but it is envisaged that the next enlargement of the EU will take place some time between 2004 and 2006. The real issue which must be resolved is how much the European Union will spend on the enlargement process and the net effects of EU policies which will operate in Ireland in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union budget, which is worth up to £80 billion, is raised by means of a contribution from each member state of 1.2 per cent of its GDP. Some member states, notably Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria, believe <Col N="1170" /> that they are contributing too much to the EU annual budget and they want their respective contributions reduced. While this issue needs to be addressed in a balanced and reasoned manner, one option which cannot be considered is the possibility of renationalising the Common Agricultural Policy within the remit of individual member states.</P>
    <P>One proposal which has surfaced in this regard is the possibility that 25 per cent of all premia payments be paid by each member state of the European Union to its farmers. I am totally opposed to such a proposal because it would lead to the ultimate fragmentation and disintegration of the Common Agricultural Policy. The CAP has survived because it has universal applicability across the territories of the European Union. If in 2000 25 per cent of all CAP payments had to be made by a particular country, what would stop the EU from forcing that country to pay 50 per cent or 75 per cent of all premia payments to its farmers in the future?</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy needs to be reformed but in a manner which protects the family farm unit and maintains young farmers working and entering the agricultural profession. It is not right or proper that 80 per cent of all CAP payments go directly to 20 per cent of farmers. This imbalance needs to be rectified in the context of CAP reform post-1999. The Common Agricultural Policy also needs to be changed in a manner which ensures that rural development programmes such as Leader II continue, as well as financing more environmentally friendly farming initiatives such as the rural environmental protection scheme.</P>
    <P>When one refers to CAP reform in the context of the Agenda 2000 programme, one must recall the severity of the price cuts which the European Commission is seeking to impose. The Commission wants a price cut in the beef sector of 30 per cent, a cut in dairy products of 15 per cent and a cut in cereals of 20 per cent. Farmers can only agree to price reductions if appropriate compensatory measures are put in place. Such compensation measures are not included in the Agriculture Commissioner's reform package. Lowering agricultural prices in Europe in line with world prices can only be agreed if adequate compensation measures are implemented at the same time. One must not forget the problems which farmers are currently experiencing. There have been wholesale reductions in the price of beef and lamb while the BSE crisis and bad weather have also contributed to the difficulties of farmers.</P>
    <P>Initiatives were put in place to ensure that the Single Market would succeed. Ireland also benefited from decisions taken when the Maastricht Treaty was implemented in 1992. The single European currency will not succeed unless the vast majority of members states of the EU are able to participate in the new régime which came on stream in 1999.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate on the implications for <Col N="1171" /> Ireland of the Agenda 2000 programme. I wish the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government well in the negotiations which will continue. However, the Government must be realistic and specific.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, here to take the question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Lowry, as Minister for Transport Energy and Communications, formally launched work on the extension of the DART to Greystones. The purpose of the extension was to provide the population of the greater north Wicklow area, including the growing towns of Greystones and Delgany, with a fast, reliable, frequent and direct public transport service to the city centre.</P>
      <P>The cost of the seven kilometre extension was estimated at £11 million. This was to be jointly financed by the EU Cohesion Fund and CIE. It was planned that, once operational, there would be five services per hour at peak commuting times and every 20 to 30 minutes at other times, and the journey to the city would take approximately 45 minutes. It is hoped the DART will attract the motorist from his or her car and on to public transport, thus saving time and fuel consumption and reducing the number of road accidents and air pollution.</P>
      <P>A few years ago, we could not have envisaged the difficulties we have today with traffic. Commuters coming into Dublin from east and north Wicklow can spend one to two hours bumper to bumper on the N11. Recently I heard a statistic quoted that, based on the current time spent travelling, the average commuter will spend two years in his car over his lifetime.</P>
      <P>The outlook is not good. It was hoped the inauguration of the new service would take place in 1998. Today we still have no service. At a recent meeting of the Greystones Town Commission on 26 January last CIE announced that this service would not now start until July 1999. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, replied to me in the Dáil on this subject on 3 November 1998 that the overhead line would be installed by the end of 1998 and the other physical work would be completed in the spring of 1999. However, the new carriages will not be delivered until the autumn of 1999. She said the company may decide to run a partial service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As travel times increase, as the queues get longer and longer and fuses get shorter and shorter, can the Minister of State tell us when the service will start and what it will consist of. Residents in this area have watched their quality of <Col N="1172" /> life deteriorate. They deserve a good public transport system.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is also anxious that the service be operational as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which is very close to Deputy Timmins's heart as it is to mine. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, would dearly like to have been here this evening, but she is indisposed, so I am glad to step into the breach.</P>
      <P>It is critically important that the population of north Wicklow is provided with a fast, reliable, frequent and direct public transport service to the city centre. The importance of a DART extension to Greystones to provide that service was recognised by the Dublin Transportation Initiative. The necessary development has been supported by this Government. However, although improvements will be evident from this summer I can understand, and share, the frustration being felt in the Greystones area because this project has taken longer than expected to complete.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for day-to-day management of this project rests with Iarnród Éireann, but I assure this House, the Deputy, and the customers who are waiting for the new service that my Department is closely monitoring the project to ensure that maximum progress is maintained.</P>
      <P>While the infrastructure project is now nearing completion, the lead in time has been considerable. In December 1995 CIE formally applied to the European Commission for assistance from the Cohesion Fund for the Greystones and Malahide extensions. In July 1996 the European Commission approved assistance from the Cohesion Fund for the two DART extensions.</P>
      <P>In October 1996 the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications indicated that the DART service to Greystones would be operational by the end of 1998. While that was a reasonable expectation at that time, a number of factors have delayed the project in the interim.</P>
      <P>Key among these was a decision by Iarnród Éireann to undertake work on Greystones and Malahide extensions simultaneously rather than constructing the Greystones extension first. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that work on the extension to Greystones is well under way. The overhead line has been installed and the other physical work is on target to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>While service details and scheduling are a matter for Iarnród Éireann, I understand from the company that it has decided to commence a partial service on the Greystones line in late summer 1999. There will be enhanced services between about 7.00 a.m. and 8 a.m. and the journey to the city centre will take approximately 45 minutes. People with a disability or mobility impairment will have full access to DART trains at Greystones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further improvements are dependent on the <Col N="1173" /> arrival of new DART carriages. Once these are operational in mid 2000, the peak hour services will be further enhanced.</P>
    <P>The extension of DART to Greystones and Malahide will place additional demands on the DART fleet which is already experiencing overcrowding in peak hours. Additional rolling stock will be needed to provide adequate capacity on the extended routes.</P>
    <P>In view of this I supported my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, in negotiating EU and Exchequer funding to acquire a further 16 carriages for delivery in the year 2000. These will enable a better service to be provided on the DART network, including Greystones.</P>
    <P>The message in summary then is that while it has been a long wait, we are within months of at last seeing improvements on the Greystones line. It is not before time and I thank the people of north Wicklow for their understanding during, the development and construction period. For its part, Iarnród Éireann has had a number of difficulties to overcome. It has worked through difficult terrain with minimum disruption to normal services. It too is keen to see the new service operating. That new service will start, albeit in a limited way, this summer. Ongoing improvements will continue to be seen on the Greystones line of the DART network over the coming years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister included Counties Cavan and Monaghan in the most recent fodder scheme. My colleague, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle also welcomes it and would agree with me that, even for the suckler and dry cow farmers, it is not enough.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to understand why dry stock and deer farmers should be left out of this Government fodder scheme. Are farmers supposed to feed beef and dry stock on air? Many farmers held stock last August and September because they were promised markets in Libya. These cattle used winter feed which was already scarce because of weather conditions. That was not the fault of the Minister. However, the fact that it was understood that a boat would sale on 1 October meant that cattle that would otherwise have been disposed of were held.</P>
      <P>The Minister must give dry stock farmers the opportunity to apply under the fodder scheme, based on need. The Minister must also look at extending the fodder scheme to deer farmers and even to horse farmers. I heard horse farmers in Donegal and other counties complain recently that they were in need as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, along with colleagues of his, the former Ministers for Agriculture and Finance, and former Commissioner Ray MacSharry, together with the former Taoiseach, encouraged farmers to go into deer production. This Government has a responsibility to provide fodder, headage grants and perhaps even premiums to <Col N="1174" /> those who remain in deer farming. At least 50 per cent have been forced out.</P>
    <P>I talked to a colleague of the Minister of State and mine in south Monaghan this evening and he told me of a farm which has sold its hinds at £70. These would have made £900 a few years ago. The Government assisted them in fencing their farms but these people cannot now sell their calves. At a meeting in Threemilehouse, the retired Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, supported this type of pyramid selling. The idea was that deer farming was one of the few alternatives for dry stock and dairy farmers which was outside the quota system. Mr. MacSharry paid £27,000 for a stag at one of the sales in Mitchelstown. His colleague, Mr. Haughey, paid £17,500. Ordinary farmers thought they were getting stags for nothing when they paid £8,000 for them. They bought them because they understood they were pure bred Hungarians. However, I discovered from a parliamentary question that only 12 Hungarian deer were ever imported here.</P>
    <P>Three years ago and on the same night I raised the issue, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, then out of office, raised a similar matter in the House on behalf of a group conducting rate valuation jobs. She said then that these people should be banned. She has now appointed none other than Ray MacSharry to the board of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>There must be an inquiry into the Galtee deer care case in Mitchelstown of which Mr. MacSharry was a director for some time. Many farmers have found themselves in severe financial difficulty. Those still in deer farming should be given the benefit of the fodder scheme and headage premia, if possible. Headage was instigated some years ago, but in a recent answer to the House the Minister, Deputy Walsh, said no further effort had been made to obtain headage for deer farming. The Government, especially the Minister, Deputy Walsh, who was involved in the promotion of deer, should take the issue seriously and try to deal with it.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear that Mr. MacSharry is giving breakfast briefings on a number of issues, including rural development. I hope it is not on deer farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the only way the Deputy will find out is to attend one of his briefings and listen to him. I thank the Deputy for giving the Leas-Cheann Comhairle credit for ensuring Monaghan and Cavan were included in the fodder scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was extremely active on it. I am pleased to have the opportunity of commenting on the difficulties which many farmers face due to a shortage of fodder for livestock feeding. These difficulties have their origin in the unusually wet weather during the summer and autumn of last <Col N="1175" /> year, which, combined with below normal sunshine, resulted in reduced grass growth throughout the country. The situation was most acute in the peaty and heavy clay soil areas of certain counties where machinery could not operate on the land due to the waterlogged conditions of the fields. The capability of farmers in these areas to make silage and hay was greatly reduced. Unfortunately, the poor weather persisted into September and this exacerbated the fodder difficulty in the most seriously affected areas. In many cases animals had to be brought indoors much earlier than normal and this added to the demand for already scarce supplies of winter fodder.</P>
      <P>A further report on winter fodder prepared by Teagasc in January this year indicated that the situation had deteriorated further due to continuous wet weather conditions, high stock levels on farms, earlier winter feedings because of ground conditions and poor silage quality. The difficulties are very widespread in the less favoured areas. The worst affected areas listed are Cavan, Monaghan, Clare, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo in the northern region. In the southern region the relevant areas are Kerry, west and north-west Cork or Duhallow, west Limerick and certain limited areas of Laois and Tipperary.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that a further scheme should be introduced to help farmers in these areas. Every effort will be made to direct aid at the most deserving cases. However, I am anxious to ensure that the grants will be paid as quickly as possible to bring immediate relief to those most in need. The Department will try to do this in the most efficient way possible while at the same time ensuring the proper standards of accountability.</P>
      <P>Earlier today the Minister, Deputy Walsh, announced further details of the 1999 fodder scheme. A sum of £20 million is being made available for the measure. In addition to the £21 million paid out in December 1998, this brings the Government's contribution to fodder related schemes to £41 million this winter. Therefore, our reaction to this problem has been substantial and real.</P>
      <P>The current scheme will have two main elements: a general fodder scheme and a special fodder hardship fund. The general fodder scheme will operate on the lines already announced on 5 February. The scheme will apply in all disadvantaged areas and cover farmers with suckler cows, lowland ewes and milk quotas under 35,000 gallons. Payment rates will be the same as in the 1998 scheme subject to the same ceiling of £300 per beneficiary. Farmers who have already qualified for payment in December 1998 will receive a 50 per cent top-up on their payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special fodder hardship fund will operate for farmers who have not qualified for the 1998 scheme or the general fodder scheme for 1999, and this scheme will operate on a nationwide basis. The objective of the fund is to provide sup<Col N="1176" /> port to cattle farmers, which includes dry stock farmers who are almost totally dependent on a small farm enterprise as a source of income. The maximum rate of payment per applicant is £450 for farms located in the district electoral divisions designated for the December 1998 scheme and £300 in all other areas. To qualify for consideration under the scheme, an applicant must fulfil certain strict criteria. Teagasc certification will be required and application forms, which include full terms and conditions, are now available from Teagasc offices.</P>
    <P>Over the past two decades the Irish deer industry has developed from very small beginnings to a sector involving some 600 producers with a total breeding stock of approximately 23,000 animals. Deer enterprises in Ireland tend to be small with the vast majority of herds less than 100 animals in size and more than half the herds are less than 50. One of the most important aspects of deer farming is that they thrive well on limited resources, which is in stark contrast to the cattle sector. Deer herds are small, so many producers may be better placed to secure the necessary supplies to feed their animals. The feed requirement of the average deer flock of 50 animals would be about two and a half round bales of hay or about 90 kgs of concentrate per week. This is in sharp contrast to what is required by smaller cattle farmers. It has accordingly been decided that deer and horses, which are close to my heart, should be excluded from the provisions of the hardship fund.</P>

      <P>Since seeking to raise this issue on the Adjournment, I am pleased to learn the alleged abduction in Kildare has proved groundless and that the case has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Garda Síochána. Over recent years, I have spoken to many people concerned about the number of women who have gone missing and whose bodies have never been found. There are also a number of other women who have been murdered and whose bodies have been found but for whose murders no person has ever been charged.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of Operation Trace, based in Naas under the supervision of an assistant commissioner, which comprises six people working directly under a superintendent. The Garda personnel involved are re-examining the files of six of the missing people whose bodies have never been found. The families of some of the missing persons have a faint hope and hold dear to that hope that their missing family members are still alive. I am certain everyone in the House shares with me the grief and sadness for all the families involved and I offer them my sympathy in their loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The six people whose cases are being examined by Operation Trace are Annie McCarrick, who went missing in 1993 aged 26, and was last seen in County Wicklow; Jo Jo Dullard, who went <Col N="1177" /> missing in 1995, aged 20; Fiona Pender, from my own constituency, who went missing in 1996 aged 25; Ciara Breen, from Dundalk, who went missing in 1997, aged 17; Fiona Sinnott, from Wexford, who went missing in 1998, aged 19; and Deirdre Jacob, aged 19 from Kildare, who went missing in 1998. These were all young women from counties in close proximity to one another &ndash; Kildare, Wicklow, Offaly, Wexford and Louth.</P>
    <P>Four other people are missing also. Antoinette Smith, went missing in 1987, aged 27 years; and Patricia Doherty, went missing in 1991, aged 30. The bodies of both these women were found in Kilakee. Eva Brennan, went missing in 1993, aged 40; her body was not found. The body of Marie Kilmartin, aged 36, was found on the Laoighis-Offaly border.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe there is a connection between these ten cases. I welcome the fact that RTE and the local media continue to raise this important and sensitive matter. Did ten different people commit murder and get away with their crimes? The bodies of most of these women have not been found. This is a serious matter that is causing concern to many people.</P>
    <P>I regret there is no sense of urgency in solving these disappearances. Many people have spoken to me about this matter. They do not believe there is a sense of urgency about it. Women are concerned for their safety. They used to go for walks on country roads, especially in the evening, but they are nervous about doing that now. Parents are also worried about the safety of their daughters, particularly when they go to a function at night. That is not good enough. We must ensure that people can traverse the country in safety.</P>
    <P>It is essential that a determined effort is made by the Government to address this matter. We need an initiative like Operation Shannon which was very successful in putting a stop to attacks on people in their homes. Such an attack took place recently west of the Shannon and the Garda are making serious inquiries into that. Similar efforts are taken each year when the Garda Síochána launch a major initiative to clamp down on drunken driving.</P>
    <P>The Minister should set up a special squad, under the direct supervision of the Garda Commissioner, which will investigate different areas. I believe these disappearances are connected. Murders were being systematically committed in Belgium but by the time the authorities became aware of a pattern, it was too late for many victims.</P>
    <P>I hope we are successful in solving these crimes sooner rather than later. It is in the best interests of the public that the people who committed them are put behind bars for a very long time. It is of particular importance to women who need to be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Enright that <Col N="1178" /> the unsolved cases of disappeared young women is a matter of the gravest concern and there is no question but that the Garda Síochána treat it with the utmost seriousness. I fully recognise the need to locate these women, and all of these cases are being dealt with by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have taken a particular interest in the issue of missing persons, and I am doing all I can to ensure that the Garda Síochána have effective arrangements and the necessary resources to trace those who are reported missing.</P>
      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner. Present arrangements are that the Garda divisional officer or district officer takes direct responsibility for searches or investigations into cases of persons who are reported missing. Special investigation teams are appointed as necessary.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe a lack of resources is inhibiting Garda investigations, but if it transpires that there is a need for additional resources to assist in these complex, painstaking and detailed investigations, I will consider any request made by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>With regard to the very disturbing incident to which the Deputy has referred, I am sure the House will appreciate that I do not wish to say anything at this point which would in any way prejudice what is an ongoing Garda investigation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright referred to Operation Trace which was established by the Garda Commissioner to review the original investigations of cases of missing women. The group is headed by an Assistant Garda Commissioner, and its programme is aimed at developing profiles of men who have shown serious sexual violence against women. This trawl will include prison records to check if any possible suspects were on temporary release on the dates on which the missing women disappeared. I understand no evidence has as yet emerged to support the possibility of a serial killer being involved.</P>
      <P>While overall statistics are no consolation to those involved, or their families, it is worth noting that by international standards the Irish position with regard to missing persons compares favourably. I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 1998 a total of 1,739 persons were reported to the Garda as missing, of which 12 remained untraced at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>While public concern over the issue of missing persons has tended to concentrate on the disappearance of young women, it is important to stress that women are not over-represented in the statistics. When we examine the figures compiled on missing persons since 1990, we find that men account for approximately 70 per cent of those who remain untraced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities continuously review the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures employed in missing persons cases and following a review of police work practices in other countries, several improvements were made <Col N="1179" /> last year. I welcome that as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>In the area of information technology, a database is being developed within PULSE, the Garda information system. This will allow for cross-referencing, linkages and analysis in dealing with missing persons cases and unidentified bodies countywide. The Garda Information Technology Section is also developing a website on the Internet.</P>
    <P>More detailed and elaborate procedures were introduced earlier in the year involving the completion of more detailed forms when missing persons are first reported, and more stringent guidelines have also been introduced in dealing with missing persons cases. The Garda also nominate liaison officers to keep the relatives of missing persons informed of progress, and a juvenile liaison officer is also involved where the missing person is under the age of 18 years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent changes in the procedures for dealing with missing persons cases which the Commissioner has introduced and on the renewed emphasis he has placed on the role of Garda liaison officers in these cases. New guidelines have also been introduced by the Garda to assist and involve the reportee or family of the missing person. The question of taking any additional operational measures to investigate such cases is being kept under review by the Garda Commissioner. I assure Deputy Enright and other Deputies that if the Garda Commissioner requires additional resources to assistance him in tracing missing persons, he will have my full co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday was the closing date for completed applications from sports, social and youth clubs under the sports capital programme. Unfortunately, since the Government came to power 20 months ago, minimal grants have been made under this programme. For example, just a few clubs in my constituency received the paltry sum of about £4,000 between them last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, constantly repeated the mantra that he was reviewing the programme and I, like other Deputies, had many lengthy discussions with him in the lobbies of this House about how he wanted to redesign and refocus it towards major projects. There was a time when the applications for this programme were often made in an informal way. When I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts there was a famous application the record of which was written on the back of a cigarette box by the former Minister, John O'Connell, but over recent years regulations and the guidelines for applications have been considerably tightened. It seems to me that there are aspects of present guidelines, particularly in relation to funding for <Col N="1180" /> projects in deprived areas, which we should look at again.</P>
    <P>The guidelines, terms and conditions for the new sports capital programme have significantly increased the onus on local bodies to come up with finance from their own resources. Applicant clubs will now have to meet at least 50 per cent of the cost of regional projects and 30 per cent of the cost of local facilities. While section 3.1 of these guidelines states that the highest priority will be given to projects in disadvantaged areas, section 2.7 states that those areas must still find at least 20 per cent of the cost of new facilities unless those districts can access EU or other national funding, where the minimal local contribution will still be 10 per cent in the main. In gravely disadvantaged areas, such as those I represent in Dublin North-East, a club might, therefore, have to raise up to £50,000 for a clubhouse or dressing rooms costing perhaps £250,000. In those areas where there is continuing significant long-term unemployment the raising of even £5,000 is a major achievement. Under these guidelines there is a requirement that applications for larger club projects must be accompanied by a costly in-depth feasibility study. There is also provision for technical advice and consultation. Clubs sponsoring projects must have long leases or own their own grounds.</P>
    <P>As has been the case throughout most of the lottery's history since 1987, it looks as if disadvantaged areas may be callously ignored. Ironically, many studies have shown that such deprived urban and rural areas are among the biggest supporters of the lottery competitions. When the price of the ticket for the twice weekly lottery draws was increased by 50 per cent from 50p to 75p per panel some months ago, the national lottery trumpeted its contribution to the types of projects in deprived areas to which I refer.</P>
    <P>We must remember the nature of social deprivation in areas such as those in the Northside Partnership area which I represent, and which is spread over a number of constituencies, where there is up to 40 per cent unemployment in some parishes despite the Celtic tiger. The net total amount allocated this year for the sports capital programme is £10 million. Some £14.5 million has been allocated but the other £4.5 million was committed for last year. It is a ludicrously small amount. In Dublin North-East alone, there are at least ten significant projects which would greatly enhance the lives and recreation of my constituents in deprived areas. They would also be a great bulwark against crime and anti-social behaviour by young people. Between £2 million and £3 million could easily be spent on Dublin North-East alone. If we were to have a credible national programme and similar sums of money available for Wicklow or Cavan-Monaghan, for example, the national programme should involve at least £50 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, whom I respect greatly, advised me over the past year and a half about what he intended to do. I want him to ask <Col N="1181" /> the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for more money to reward those wonderful people in so many social, GAA and soccer clubs. These people have given of their spare time and money to keep young kids off the streets and to facilitate senior citizens. I ask that he give them the kind of reward which we should be giving as we head into the millennium year, in which it is expected that the level of growth will be 10 per cent and when the level over the next ten years is expected to be 6 per cent. In that context, he should reinterpret the guidelines on behalf of the people of disadvantaged areas who deserve better consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important matter. I apologise to the House for the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid and want to make the following statement on his behalf.</P>
      <P>In making Deputy McDaid the first Minister for Sport, the Taoiseach, in his Dáil speech on the appointment of the Government, specifically referred to the role of sport in the fight against social disadvantage. The needs of deprived communities were uppermost in Minister McDaid's mind when he undertook to review the terms of the sports capital programme. He is conscious of the role sport and leisure play in the life of communities or individuals, especially in disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>The new sports capital programme, which the Minister announced in December last following a comprehensive review of the existing programme, has a clear focus on disadvantaged areas. This programme provides national lottery funding towards the provision of sports and recreational facilities and is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of such facilities in Ireland. The Government has committed over £50 million from the national lottery to the new programme over the next three years to assist in the provision of high quality, well designed sport and recreational facilities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The £50 million being spent by this Government over the next three years compares with £17 million spent over the past three years. This increased spending on sport is mirrored across the board. This Government is spending £39 million per year on sport compared with £13 million per year when the rainbow Government left office in June 1997.</P>
      <P>The emphasis on disadvantaged communities is reflected across all areas of sports spending under this Government. This concentration of dramatically increased sports spending in disadvantaged communities contrasts with the untargeted splurge of £9 million on the eve of the last election by the rainbow Government. The needs of disadvantaged communities were not considered then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Government, special priority is being given to the development of facilities in disadvantaged areas. In terms of developing facili<Col N="1182" /> ties, the Minister is aware that a persistent problem in disadvantaged areas is the difficulty many clubs and local groups have in raising local funding to which the Deputy referred. To help address this issue, the maximum percentage of grant-aid available where facilities are located in disadvantaged areas can be as high as 80 per cent in cases of real need, as opposed to 70 per cent in non-disadvantaged areas. Where it is possible for clubs and community organisations in such areas to access other sources of State or EU funding to make up the balance of the overall cost of the project, they will only be required to raise 5 per cent of funding locally &ndash; as opposed to 10 per cent in non-disadvantaged areas &ndash; if deemed appropriate in the context of projects contributing to overall policy priorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes that there is a need for local communities to contribute some funding towards the cost of sports facilities for their areas, so that they can identify with the projects in question. He feels strongly that a club or community group is more likely to maintain and get the most out of a facility if it has contributed financially to it rather than having it all paid for by others. A local contribution also provides some assurance that the club or group can generate funds that will enable it to maintain and manage the facility once it is built.</P>
    <P>Overall capital commitments outstanding under the programme at the end of 1998 amounted to approximately £16 million. These commitments must be met in 1999 and subsequent years on satisfactory completion of projects, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the programme. In addition, almost 1,900 new applications were received under the programme by last Friday's deadline for receipt of such applications. While the overall amount of funding being sought in these applications has yet to be quantified, the Minister expects it to be very substantial.</P>
    <P>The provision of facilities does not in itself, however, ensure increased participation by local communities from disadvantaged areas. Experience to date would suggest that clubs and community groups who operate facilities in their areas need to employ a range of strategies to ensure that local communities have access to facilities, to encourage local people to make use of them and to ensure that they are attracted by what is on offer in the facilities.</P>
    <P>The young people's facilities and services fund has been established for the purpose of developing youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, with a view to attracting young people in those areas, at risk of becoming involved in drugs, into more healthy and productive pursuits. A sum of £30 million has been provided to this fund and decisions on the allocation of a major portion of this funding are likely to be taken in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There are also other initiatives under way <Col N="1183" /> aimed at increasing participation in sport and recreation in disadvantaged areas. The most recent of these is based on using the organisational skills and experience of three of our largest national governing bodies of sport. The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation has recently agreed a pilot project with the Gaelic Athletic Association for the development of, and increased participation in hurling and football in disadvantaged areas in major urban centres. An amount of £40,000 was paid in 1998 to the GAA towards the development of the project. A proposal from the FAI is also currently under consideration in relation to initiatives for the development of its sport in disadvantaged areas while the IRFU is also contemplating involvement in this initiative specifically designed for governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, in conjunction with the Irish Sports Council, consideration is currently being given to piloting further new approaches to increasing <Col N="1184" /> participation in sport and recreation at local level. Before finalising proposals, including the designation of any area for possible pilot projects, the Department will be consulting with the appropriate vocational education committees, local authorities and sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>Previous administrations talked about social disadvantage. This Government is delivering. There is a Minister with responsibility for sport at the Cabinet table and in 18 months the amount of money spent on sport has been trebled. The new revised sports capital scheme will ensure that these significant extra resources will be targeted to disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>Taking all these initiatives into account, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid considers that the needs of people in disadvantaged areas in relation to the provision of sport and recreational facilities are being catered for.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 February 1999.</P>

      <P>APSO is a State-sponsored body established in 1974 to promote and sponsor temporary personal service by skilled Irish people in developing countries. The focus of its work is increasingly on local skills enhancement in support of self-reliance and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the board and management of APSO took the innovative step to pioneer social accounting as a means of improving both the accountability of the organisation and the quality of service provided. This is the first time in Ireland that any agency in the development sector has conducted such a study of its own performance and APSO is to be commended for taking this innovative and challenging step. The Department, which is represented on the board of APSO, was fully supportive of the exercise.</P>
      <P>The report, entitled APSO Social Accounts 1996, was published in 1998. It identifies a range of stakeholder groups, including APSO's partner organisations in developing countries, whose views were sought on the overall performance of the agency. The report contains a wealth of information, much of which reflects very positively on the organisation.</P>
      <P>It also identifies a number of areas where it was felt there was room for improvement. This is perfectly normal in respect of any organisation open enough to engage in this kind of critical self-evaluation and does not detract from the agency's overall effectiveness.</P>
      <P>I should add that APSO and the volunteers it sends to developing countries are held in very high esteem in these countries. In recent discussions with a series of Ministers from Caribbean countries, this view was reiterated to me and to Irish officials. I have also been able to see at close quarters this year the very worthwhile work the agency is carrying out through its volunteers in Central America, both in terms of long-term development and effective response to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Mitch.</P>
      <P>The board, of which an official of my Department is a member, and the management of APSO have already initiated follow-up action on those aspects of APSO's performance identified in the social accounts as needing attention.</P>
      <P>The accounts of the Agency are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who since 1993 also have a function in checking for value for money. APSO's accounts have always been found to be in good order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 41, 87 and 101 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the very volatile situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa where the greatest threat to the stability of the region is the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This crisis directly affects a number of countries in the region, including Rwanda. The increasing militarisation of the region is very worrying.  Ireland, together with our EU part<Col N="1187" /> ners, remains seriously concerned about the situation in Rwanda which is still recovering from the appalling genocide of 1994 and its aftermath. The EU is currently preparing its review of developments in Rwanda as provided for in the relevant common position adopted in March 1998. As part of that review we will be evaluating the situation on the ground including preparations for local elections, the development of civil society, the new democratic structures at local level and the impact on Rwanda of the conflict in neighbouring DRC. The EU Special Envoy to the region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, has been mandated to visit Rwanda to assist the Union in understanding and addressing the complex internal situation.</P>
    <P>The conflict in the DRC has serious ethnic and security implications, not just for Rwanda but for other countries in Central and Southern Africa. We actively support with our EU partners the peace efforts of regional leaders. If unresolved, this conflict has the potential to seriously undermine any progress made towards recovery, rehabilitation and reconciliation in Rwanda. A regional solution which takes into account the rights of minorities, security of borders, good governance and democratic transition is essential if the conditions which will lead to peaceful development are to be established.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as in all conflicts, the innocent suffer. Human rights abuses have been committed by all parties to the conflict. Deputy Spring in his question refers to reports of a massacre in Makobolo in the eastern part of the DRC. The nature of the conflict has made it very difficult to verify these reports as access by independent observers is almost impossible. The Government condemns in the strongest terms all human rights abuses.  Full observance of human rights and the rule of law is a core objective of our policy towards Rwanda and the other countries in the region.</P>
    <P>Rwanda, one of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, is recovering from an officially-orchestrated genocide which killed between 500,000 and 800,000 people in 1994. The ensuing conflict and chaos resulted in a massive displacement of people. The Irish Government and people responded very generously to the suffering of the Rwandan people and, indeed, the President of Ireland made three visits to Rwanda to give official expression to this outpouring of sympathy.</P>
    <P>We are now, together with other members of the international community, trying to establish the necessary conditions for peace, stability and development based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is in line with EU policy which supports the process started by the Rwandan Government to recover from genocide, promote national reconciliation and reconstruction and transition to democracy. In order to achieve these objectives the cycle of violence and impunity must be broken and this involves not only working to strengthen civil society but also <Col N="1188" /> to support the rehabilitation of the institutions of Government so that they are fair, inclusive and responsive to all sectors of this very divided society.</P>
    <P>Helping societies torn by conflict is not easy and legitimate questions can be raised about human rights, good governance and military expenditure.  Equally legitimate questions can be asked about who will suffer if assistance is withdrawn. These questions do not apply just to Rwanda but to many other countries and point to the critical need to address not only the consequences of conflict but also its causes.</P>
    <P>Irish assistance to Rwanda is targeted at the most vulnerable people who must be empowered if there is to be lasting change in their communities and societies. Survival is a priority and, therefore, Ireland's programme of assistance focuses, in the first instance, on meeting basic humanitarian needs in the areas of shelter, food security and basic health care. This is not enough and Ireland, with other donor countries and the UN agencies, has worked to help re-establish the institutions of government. Clearly identified activities of the Rwandan Government in the areas of justice, housing and health have been supported. In 1997, of a total allocation of £2.2 million, 18 per cent supported Rwanda Government projects and 0.3 per cent of the same amount in 1998. The majority of Irish assistance is channelled through the Irish NGOs, Concern and Trócaire, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN Development Programme and UNICEF.</P>
    <P>Monitoring and assessment teams from the Department of Foreign Affairs travel at least twice yearly to Rwanda to monitor existing projects and assess future needs. The most recent visit took place in December 1998 and recommended that assistance continue to be focused on shelter, basic health, on the administration of justice and on prisoner support. In addition, the Chargé d'Affairs in Uganda, who is accredited to Rwanda, visits Rwanda regularly.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Mitchell's question, GOAL has raised its concerns on a number of occasions through the Oireachtas Committees, parliamentary questions and representations to both myself and Minister of State O'Donnell. Concern works closely with Irish Aid in developing and implementing suitable programmes.  I am satisfied that we, together with our European partners, are pursuing the right policies in the region. I hope I have been able to reassure those people who have doubts about assistance to the people of Rwanda that the funding provided by the taxpayer through the Irish Government is reaching its intended targets, and that it is helping to improve the lives of the most vulnerable people in this deeply traumatised society.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 48, 69 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>I have gone to some lengths as Minister for Foreign Affairs to promote debate and understanding of the realities of what is involved in Partnership for Peace in this House and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The question of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace was the subject of a Private Member's motion and debate recently in this House. This proved to be very useful in the context of the ongoing debate which the Government has encouraged. During the debate, the Taoiseach told the House that the Government would envisage that, all going well, Ireland will participate in Partnership for Peace in the second half of this year. I also referred to this timeframe on Sunday last in an interview on RTE radio. I have previously undertaken in this House, and I do so again now, that a decision by the Government in favour of Ireland's participation in PfP would make clear the nature and scope of Irish participation in PfP, and would be submitted to this House for its approval. I would recall also that the Government Resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 28 January 1999, at the end of the Private Members debate, makes clear the Government's commitment favourably to examine further Ireland's participation in PfP, taking into account the ongoing public debate and subject to the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation in Partnership for Peace would not be in conflict with our neutrality. Irish participation in PfP would be on our terms. PfP imposes no treaty obligations. I do not believe, therefore, that a referendum on this matter is either required or appropriate. I have made clear that the opportunity of referring to the people would arise in the course of the European Parliament election campaign next June, in which no doubt <Col N="1190" /> parties will take the opportunity to set out their approaches.</P>
    <P>The recent Government resolution in the Dáil reaffirmed our commitment to a referendum should the issue of a collective or mutual defence obligation ever arise in the future. No such obligations would be involved in participating in Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>As regards consultations with NATO regarding the question of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace, we would take the appropriate practical steps at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is an important and positive element in co-operation for peacekeeping and crisis management. PfP is also a significant element in Europe's security architecture, and it is natural that PfP should arise from time to time in discussions with my colleagues from the EU. Interest has been expressed in our position outside PfP, particularly by the other neutral states. I have not encountered any pressure from any of my EU counterparts on this matter.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement includes a section which deals specifically with the issue of decommissioning. The participants to the Agreement are asked to reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations. They are also asked to confirm their intention to continue to work constructively and in good faith with the Independent Commission, and to use any influence that they may have, to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years following endorsement in referendums North and South of the agreement and in the context of an overall settlement.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply to Priority Questions Nos. 6 and 7, decommissioning was an essential part of the negotiations. Like all its aspects, the provisions of the Agreement in this area must be implemented in full.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 18 December last, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the case of General Pinochet which is now before the British courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without intervening in this particular case, let me say that it is my belief that abuses of human rights anywhere are of concern to the entire inter<Col N="1191" /> national community. I believe that the perpetrators of all human rights abuses should be brought to justice in accordance with law. Throughout the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, Ireland strongly condemned the violations of human rights carried out by the regime, and as a practical expression of our sympathy for the victims we welcomed Chilean refugees into Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to the prosecution of those accused of human rights abuses, the international community took an important step forward on 17 July last, with the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The statute makes clear that official capacity and immunities shall not be a bar to the exercise of the courts jurisdiction. Ireland was one of the first signatories of the statute. The Government is committed to making our contribution towards bringing the court into being by taking appropriate action at national level to ratify the statute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of missing persons is one of the important and sensitive issues which will have to be addressed in the context of the search for an overall political solution to the Cyprus question. In July 1981, a Committee on Missing Persons was established, comprising a representative of each of the two communities on the island and a representative appointed by the UN Secretary General. However, progress proved difficult to achieve.</P>
      <P>In April 1996 on the occasion of the retirement of his representative on the committee, the Secretary General wrote to the leaders of the two communities requesting a reaffirmation of their commitment to making progress on the issue, before the appointment of a new representative. He set out a number of proposals to which he sought their agreement, concerning the definition of categories of cases, the sequence in which investigations would be carried out and the question of cases without known witnesses. Although both sides informed the Secretary General that they agreed with his proposals, the tasks involved remain to be fully implemented by them. However, in June 1998 the Secretary General appointed Mr. Jean Pierre Ritter as his new representative on the Committee of Missing Persons. The first meeting of the newly reconstituted committee was held on 28 January this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A related but separate development took place in July 1997, when the leaders of the two communities reached bilateral agreement regarding the exchange of information on the location of <Col N="1192" /> the graves of missing persons and the return of their remains. Information concerning a number of missing persons is understood to have been subsequently exchanged by both sides. Agreement was also reached that each side would proceed at the technical level to acquire the necessary expertise to carry out identification. However, at a bilateral meeting in April 1998 between the two sides at which the Secretary General's Deputy Special Representative was present, the Turkish Cypriot side indicated that it was not prepared to discuss arrangements for the exhumation and return of remains until the Greek Cypriot side agreed to first look into the fate of Greek Cypriot victims of the coup detat against Archbishop Makarios in 1974. The Turkish Cypriot side claimed that victims of the coup detat were among those listed as missing. The United Nations has indicated it considers the Turkish Cypriot request as falling outside the terms of the 1997 bilateral agreement between both sides. The Greek Cypriot authorities is understood to have since decided to begin exhumation and identification of the remains located in graves in the area under its control.</P>
    <P>I continue to be concerned at the failure to achieve substantive progress on this important matter. I have no doubt that the issue of missing persons will be among the matters raised during the confidential contacts, which are currently taking place between the leaders of the two communities and the Secretary General's Deputy Special Representative, Dame Anne Hercus, in the search for an overall political solution to the Cyprus question. For Ireland's part, we will continue to urge both communities to make every effort to achieve progress on the matter and we have made clear to the United Nations that we stand ready to provide any assistance which they consider could be helpful in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 27 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks significant progress towards a resolution of the East Timor issue appears to have been made, although there are continuing <Col N="1193" /> doubts about the extent of the commitment of the Indonesian Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>Of primary importance have been the talks between the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers which have been taking place at the United Nations in New York over the past six months. Reports from New York in the past week indicate that Indonesia is now prepared to offer special status with wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In return, however, Indonesia insists that the sovereignty which it claims over the territory would have to be recognised. If that should not prove to be acceptable to the East Timorese people following a consultation process, Indonesia has stated that the territory would be returned to Portugal as the former colonial power. It would then become the responsibility of Portugal to administer the processes of decolonisation and self-determination in the territory in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>It is not yet clear what form of consultative process may be put into operation in East Timor while the territory remains under Indonesian control, and this remains an issue of considerable concern. We believe that such a consultation process should be under UN supervision. I have every confidence, however, that the UN Secretary General and his Special Envoy, Ambassador Marker, will make all possible efforts to ensure that a fair and accurate exercise will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In my statement issued on 1 February, I stressed Ireland's readiness to offer assistance to the United Nations should it be decided to dispatch observers or monitors to East Timor in order to oversee the ceasefire and the military withdrawal which I hope will soon be put in place. This offer of assistance extends also to the consultation process once satisfactory arrangements have been agreed.</P>
    <P>I have already made known my intention to visit Jakarta at an early date in order to meet the Timorese resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, who has recently been moved from prison to house arrest. The purpose of my visit would be to show solidarity with the East Timorese cause and to support the efforts being made in Indonesia to promote a just settlement leading to self-determination for the people of East Timor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The Middle East peace process is now at a critical point following the decision by the Israeli Government last December to suspend implementation of the Wye River Memorandum until after the Israeli elections, scheduled for 17 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the outstanding role in the peace process played by King Hussein. His diplomacy and his commitment to peace will be greatly missed. I hope that the supreme effort which he made, when terminally ill, to secure <Col N="1195" /> agreement on the Wye River Memorandum will not be in vain and that the parties will rededicate themselves to the efforts to bring about a permanent peace. In fact, the coming together of so many disparate political figures for the Jordanian Kings funeral last week may have helped provide the necessary impetus to restart the process. It is also significant that his son and successor to the throne, King Abdullah, has committed himself to carrying on the work so important to his father.</P>
    <P>The Government, together with its EU partners, was very disappointed that new conditions seemed to have been added by Israel to the implementation of the Memorandum. Following the suspension of its implementation in December, the EU Presidency issued a declaration expressing the EUs regret at the Israeli Governments decision. At the most recent General Affairs Council meeting on 25 January, I and my EU colleagues deplored the continued suspension of Wye, in contravention of both the spirit and the letter of the memorandum. The Council also repeated its appeal to both sides to implement the agreement fully and without new conditions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who last month visited the region and met with both sides, was informed by Prime Minister Netanyahu that Israel was ready to continue with negotiations in the period before the elections &ndash; either within the Wye River Memorandum framework or outside it. The Taoiseach was also impressed by the seriousness with which President Arafat views the current impasse in the peace process and by the desire on the Palestinian side to explore possibilities for re-establishing the momentum of the talks.</P>
    <P>Since the Taoiseach's visit, President Arafat has indicated on 11 February that the Palestinians are discussing the possibility of delaying the declaration on statehood due to be made on 4 May. I believe that any action which would help to build confidence and trust between the parties is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The EU Presidency and the EU Special Envoy to the Middle East have just concluded a visit to the region. It is to be hoped that this visit will have encouraged the parties to renew the progress that was achieved at Wye. I expect to hear a report from the German Foreign Minister at the meeting of the General Affairs Council next Monday.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 52, 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>I remain deeply concerned at the human rights situation in Algeria.</P>
      <P>Within the framework of the preparations for the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which commences in Geneva on 22 March next, we will be discussing the situation in Algeria with our EU partners. We will also be liaising closely with other states which share our concerns about human rights abuses in Algeria. In the process of developing our position we will be looking into a number of options, including those put forward by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>While the scale of the unrest has abated and while there appears to be a slight amelioration in the overall security situation in Algeria, reports show that massacres and bombings are still being perpetrated. There are repeated accounts of basic human rights violations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have used every possible opportunity to convey to the Algerian authorities our concerns about the situation there. Last month our Ambassador to Spain, who is accredited to Algeria, specifically raised the questions of tor<Col N="1197" /> ture and disappearances in his meetings with President Zeroual and the Foreign Ministry. Similar concerns have also been expressed by the EU on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>It remains essential that Algeria work with the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. However, Algeria has made it clear it is not prepared to accept UN Special Rapporteurs for Torture and Extrajudicial Executions. The Government and our EU partners intend to maintain pressure on the Algerian authorities to accept the UN Special Rapporteurs, and will continue to work to achieve a greater degree of co-operation between Algeria and the United Nations. In this context, I discussed with the Secretary General of the United Nations during his recent visit here developments in a number of countries in which the United Nations is already actively involved on the ground. Unfortunately, Algeria is not yet in that category.</P>
    <P>As regards raising human rights abuses at the UN General Assembly, I set out, in my statement to the Assembly last September, our broad approach to human rights abuses wherever they occurred. While I did not give an exhaustive list of countries, our position on Algeria was covered by the detailed statement made by the EU Presidency on our behalf. I also had a meeting with the Algerian Foreign Minister in New York, in the course of which I reiterated our concerns. In this context, while I did discuss with the Secretary General of the United Nations during his recent visit here developments in a number of countries in which the United Nations is already actively involved on the ground. Unfortunately, Algeria is not yet in that category.</P>
    <P>Finally I understand that a delegation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is due to visit Algeria next week. I very much welcome this. I am sure that they will help to convey the deep concern in this country at the situation in Algeria to the parties represented in the National Assembly, and give the latter encouragement to pursue with renewed commitment the improvement of the human rights situation of the people of Algeria.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is very concerned at the deteriorating political, economic and social situation in Zimbabwe. Repressive measures are being taken by the authorities against the press and there have been allegations that journalists <Col N="1198" /> detained are being subjected to torture. The national television address delivered by President Mugabe on 6 February sought to defend these actions and was critical of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>These developments, together with the ongoing land reform crisis and the consequences of Zimbabwe's direct military involvement in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, constitute a threat to Zimbabwe's stability as a democratic society founded on the rule of law and observance of human rights.</P>
    <P>The EU and other members of the international community are actively responding to the latest developments. Following the arrests and alleged torture of journalists, a démarche was made by the EU Troika of Ambassadors in Harare to the acting Foreign Minister of Zimbabwe on 29 January. Members of the troika were accompanied on that occasion by their counterparts from the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. Their joining the EU troika underlined the high priority attached to dealing effectively with such human rights violations.</P>
    <P>In making the <i>démarche</i>, particular concern was expressed about: the detention of civilians by the military, threats to the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, the violation of freedom of the press, and the alleged violation of human rights by the use of torture which cannot be justified in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>In follow-up to the <i>démarche</i>, Ireland and our European partners are monitoring developments closely. We are continuing to urge the Government of Zimbabwe to demonstrate its commitment to international standards on human rights, to investigate the alleged human rights violations without delay and to bring those responsible to justice. We will continue to press the authorities in that country to take the necessary urgent action to restore confidence in the consistency of their approach to human rights, respect for the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, freedom of expression and the role of the military in a democratic society.</P>
    <P>Although the specific issue has not yet been discussed by the General Affairs Council, the council has been following closely developments in the region and will be ready to consider the further steps that may be necessary if there is no improvement in the situation in Zimbabwe.</P>

      <P>The Cultural Relations Committee (CRC) is a voluntary, non-statutory body, established in 1949. Its members are appointed by the Minister <Col N="1199" /> for Foreign Affairs to advise on the distribution of financial grants from the allocation for cultural relations abroad made to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these grants is to give support in other countries to Irish cultural activities of excellence. In deciding on the activities to be assisted, attention is also given to their potential to promote tourism and investment from abroad. Proposals are considered for events, for example, performances, exhibitions, lectures the full costs of which are not available to those involved in their organisation or performance. Decisions on the disbursement of funds are made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs based on the Cultural Relations Committee's recommendations.</P>
      <P>I have already made available in December 1998 details of the grants for 1997 in response to Deputy Sargent's parliamentary question. The figures for 1998 are in the course of finalisation and I will make them available to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 29, 34, 46, 65 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remain extremely concerned about the situation in Kosovo. It is for this reason that it is crucial that the talks now taking place at Rambouil<Col N="1200" /> let between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians, and on which international efforts are now centered, result in an agreement leading to a peaceful and lasting settlement.</P>
    <P>The urgency of these talks was highlighted by the increasing pattern of breaches of the ceasefire in recent week and the appalling atrocities, including the massacre at Racak, which outraged the world. There was also the very real threat of a resumption of largescale violence, which otherwise could take place in a few weeks time, with the end of winter. This also is why the process now under way at Rambouillet has been welcomed and received the support of the United Nations Security Council, of the Organization for Security and Co-operation and of the EU. I should mention that the EU's Special Envoy to Kosovo, the Austrian Ambassador Wolfgang Petritsch, is playing a central role in the process, with the full support of the Union.</P>
    <P>Since the outbreak of the crisis last March, Kosovo has been constantly on the agenda of the General Affairs Council, and indeed on the agendas of the European Council which have taken place in this period. At the most recent meeting of the General Affairs Council on 25 January, we gave the matter detailed consideration. I then made known my outrage at the Racak massacre and called for the admission of the Chief Prosecutor of the Criminal Tribunal to carry out investigations. It was also then that I and my EU colleagues stressed the need for mutually reinforcing actions by the various international fora in addressing the situation in Kosovo, and I expressed my support for the negotiating process on the basis of the proposals put forward by the international mediators, Ambassadors Hill and Petritsch, which had been endorsed by the EU and the Contact Group of six countries. These proposals now provide the basis for the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I reiterate now my hope that these efforts will be fruitful, not only because of how appalling the alternative could be, but also because a successful outcome in the form of a settlement would put an end to the horrors which we have witnessed, and set a course in which measures, reforms and new structures would be set in place to ensure the protection of the human rights of all the citizens of Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The Contact Group in Paris on Sunday informed the parties that the negotiations must be concluded by noon next Saturday. The difficulties for both sides in reconciling their fundamentally different positions should not be underestimated. It is clear that the basis for an agreement does exist in the proposals put by the Contact Group to both sides. Whether or not an agreement will be secured depends ultimately on the necessary political will being forthcoming in Belgrade and on the part of the Kosovo Albanian side including the Kosovo Liberation Army. The gravity of the situation is such that neither side in the talks should be unaware of the consequences <Col N="1201" /> of failure, particularly if they have contributed in any way to it.</P>
    <P>I have previously reported to the House on the sanctions introduced by the EU against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. These remain fully in force. I should also point out that I and my colleagues at the General Affairs Council on 25 January instructed the Council's competent bodies to step up work, in parallel with the ongoing negotiations in various fora, on the strengthening of sanctions. This work is continuing notwithstanding the start of the negotiations. In the absence of any progress in the talks at Rambouillet, which I sincerely hope will not be the case, I can assure the Houses that I shall be pressing for the strengthening and widening of sanctions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 57, 60 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in Iraq remains a source of grave concern. There are ongoing military actions involving British and US aircraft, progress at the United Nations in addressing the underlying problems of Iraq's non-compliance with resolutions of the Security Council is slow and mean<Col N="1202" /> time the plight of the Iraqi people as a whole remains unrelieved, with considerable hardship and suffering amongst the most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>For significant progress to be made, it is essential that Iraq demonstrate its willingness to comply fully with the resolutions adopted by the Security Council, the body with primary responsibility, under the UN Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Government regrets that the regime has not so complied, particularly as regards the resolutions addressing the question of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. This failure was the direct cause of the air strikes by the US and the UK in mid December and the simultaneous suspension of the work of the UN weapons inspectors.</P>
    <P>Throughout January, the UN Security Council discussed options leading to the full implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions. On 30 January it decided to establish three separate panels to address issues relating to arms inspections, humanitarian assistance and prisoners of war under the chairmanship of the Permanent Representative of Brazil. These panels are to report not later than 15 April 1999.</P>
    <P>France, which is a permanent member of the Council, has proposed the establishment of a long-term security effort aimed at preventing the development of weapons of mass destruction by Iraq, the lifting of the oil embargo and the implementation of a system of economic and financial monitoring aimed at ensuring that Iraq develops its economy in a transparent way. I welcome the general thrust of the French proposal and am confident that its contents will be considered by the panels mentioned above.</P>
    <P>As regards military action against Iraq we were deeply disappointed that the use of force was deemed necessary in December. Clearly it would have been preferable if it could have been avoided. We are monitoring the current military situation and note that it appears to be mainly directed against military targets. We are concerned at any such action, both because it lessens the chances of the suffering of the Iraqi people being alleviated and because of its destabilising consequences on the region as a whole. We hope that the current phase of military action will soon be terminated.</P>
    <P>I have noted the newspaper reports referred to by Deputy Bruton. As I indicated above both the issues of arms inspection and the supply of humanitarian assistance are the subject of panels set up under the authority of the Security Council. I am confident that the work of these panels, as well as proposals such as those put forward by France, will lead to the reappraisal of both the objectives and effects of UN policy towards Iraq which he seeks. I am also sure that the lessons learned from the implementation of the system of arms inspections set up to deal in the case of Iraq will prove useful in similar cases in the future.</P>

      <P>I visited Iran from 25 to 28 January this year. The purpose of my visit was to co-chair the third session of the Ireland-Iran Joint Economic Commission together with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Dr. Kamal Kharazzi. Discussions covered a wide range of issues, including trade, aviation, education, agriculture, fisheries and investment. The beef trade formed an important part of the discussions.</P>
      <P>The background to my discussions on the beef trade was the visit of an Iranian veterinary delegation to Ireland last year, which led to the signing of a veterinary protocol on 29 October last setting out the detailed arrangements for the resumption of trade. During my visit, I had separate meetings with the Ministers responsible for the beef trade, Mr. Mohammad Shariyatmadari, the Minister for Commerce, and Mr. Mohammad Saeedi Kia, the Minister for the Construction Crusade. I also met with representatives of the Irish meat exporting companies while I was in Tehran to brief them on the progress of my discussions.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that all technical and regulatory obstacles to the resumption of trade have now been removed. The only exception concerns beef from the areas immediately surrounding confirmed BSE cases. However, Iran has fulfilled its requirements for beef in the period up to March. The next contracts will be considered in April, and I have been assured by my Iranian counterpart that Irish beef will be given every consideration at that time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the Western Europe and others group of States for <Col N="1204" /> the two-year term 2001/2002. The election will take place in the 185-member UN General Assembly in the autumn of 2000, probably in October. The election is being contested by two other candidates, Norway and Turkey. Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of those States present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 120 States will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have sought support for Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions, including on official visits abroad. Since September last, I have personally discussed Ireland's candidacy with representatives of over forty United Nations member states. In September, before the campaign entered a more intense phase, we had around 30 commitments. This level of support has been built on and I am determined that by September-October 2000 when the election takes place we will have the necessary number of votes to secure election; this would be around 121 votes. I can confirm that our candidature has received a very positive response but as this is a contested election, I am reluctant to indicate the precise level of support committed to Ireland at this stage.</P>
    <P>As regards UN reform, in line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, Ireland has actively supported efforts to modernise and reform the UN system so that it can be more effective in responding to the complex and difficult challenges in the coming millennium. Our priority is to secure agreement on the measures necessary to revitalise the United Nations and to ensure more vigorous action in fulfilling its mandate under the UN Charter of maintaining international peace and security and promoting the economic and social development of all Member States. With our EU partners, we have given strong support to measures aimed at securing a better co-ordinated and more streamlined UN, which makes more effective use of personnel and financial resources, and at improving the setting of priorities for action by the UN.</P>
    <P>Ireland takes an active role in ongoing discussions in New York on Security Council reform and, as a member of an informal group of ten small and medium-sized States, has played a significant bridge-building role in the debate. Ireland supports a reform of the composition of the Security Council which would make it more representative of the general membership of the UN. We favour a small increase in permanent members (from its present number of five) selected on the basis of global influence and contribution to the work of the UN as well as considerations of equitable geographical distribution. We also favour a small increase in non-permanent members of around five, with these new seats being allocated to the various regional groups. In addition to the enlargement issue, Ireland favours improved and more transparent working methods of the Council involving more frequent consultation between it and the General Assembly, the <Col N="1205" /> Secretary-General and other major organs of the UN system. We also see a need for more restrictive use of the veto power of the permanent members of the Security Council and we believe that the veto power should not be extended to any new permanent members.</P>

      <P>When I launched the New Agenda Declaration in Dublin on 9 June last year, I stated that it was my intention to pursue this initiative in the context of the General Assembly of the United Nations and at other fora as appropriate. In September the eight Foreign Ministers of the New Agenda Group met in New York and launched a draft resolution at the General Assembly with a view to securing the support of the wider international community for the objectives which the new Agenda Group had set. This draft resolution became the centrepiece of the disarmament deliberations in the General Assembly and the New Agenda countries worked tirelessly to bring the international community to endorse the new direction which we had advanced and to act on foot of our recommendations.</P>
      <P>The General Assembly adopted our draft resolution by 114 votes in favor, with 38 abstentions and 18 negative votes. This was an outstanding result for a resolution which aimed to set aside the impasse in nuclear disarmament and the drift towards acceptance of the indefinite retention of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapon States. It was in particular significant that the non-nuclear weapon states members of NATO decided not to oppose our resolution, recognizing that our approach represented a realistic way forward in nuclear disarmament.</P>
      <P>Much remains to be done, however, to achieve the objectives set out in the New Agenda. One area where we are focusing attention is the preparation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference scheduled for next year. This will be a singularly important gathering of the States Parties. All the parties to the treaty, both nuclear weapon and non-nuclear weapon States alike, are committed under Article VI to the elimination of nuclear weapons and nuclear disarmament. In the framework of these legally binding commitments it is our intention to urge the nuclear weapon States to commit themselves unequivocally to pursue those steps required by them to realize the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.</P>

    <P>We will return to the United Nations General Assembly later this year with a draft resolution <Col N="1206" /> and with a view to securing an even greater number of endorsements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the plight of some women in Pakistan. Pakistan has acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. I accordingly urge the Pakistani authorities to honour fully the commitments entered into under this convention. I also hope that they are considering very carefully the recommendations set out in the report by their own Commission of Inquiry for Women published in March 1997.</P>
      <P>The human rights situation in Pakistan was one of the issues raised at the political dialogue between the EU and Pakistan which was held in Vienna on 25 November 1998. At this meeting, the EU stressed that all forms of discrimination, including gender discrimination, were unacceptable in today's world.</P>

      <P>I had a very useful and constructive meeting with United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan on 21 January last. We discussed a wide range of issues relating to the activities of the United Nations, including Ireland's contribution in the <Col N="1207" /> fields of peacekeeping, development assistance, disarmament and human rights; the current position on UN reform and Security Council reform and on UN financing. We also discussed developments on regional issues including Kosovo, East Timor, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Libya. I briefed the Secretary General on my recent visit to Honduras and on the visit I was about to undertake to Teheran. I also took the opportunity to brief the Secretary General on developments in Northern Ireland and on the current state of the peace process.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General was most appreciative of Ireland's contribution to the United Nations across the range of UN activities. I reiterated our ongoing commitment to the organisation and our willingness to continue to contribute to it. I took the opportunity to raise with the Secretary General our concerns about arrears due to Ireland in respect of peacekeeping operations. The Secretary General understood my concern, and indicated that he is working to resolve the situation.</P>
      <P>Our discussion on Kosovo took place in the aftermath of the appalling massacre at Racak. We agreed on the need for an urgent investigation of the massacre and the bringing to justice of those responsible. We discussed the prospects for progress towards a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo conflict. We noted the hopeful signs of progress on East Timor, including those relating to the early release of resistance leader Xanana Gusmao. The Secretary General briefed me on recent developments in Africa. We expressed grave concerns, in particular, about the situation in Angola, in Sierra Leone and in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Secretary General also informed me of ongoing negotiations relating to the Lockerbie suspects and hoped for early progress towards a trial. On Iraq, we discussed the prospects for progress towards a resolution of the situation, with the commencement of Security Council discussions on the basis of new proposals put forward by France and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 39, 90 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the most up-to-date calculation available, official development assistance, ODA, in 1999 will amount to £158 million. This is the largest allocation for ODA since our aid programme began twenty-five years ago this year. Our best estimate for ODA next year, the year 2000, is that it will reach £172 million and £195 million in 2001. The figure for 1998 was £137m. Seven years ago in 1992, ODA was only £40m. In effect then from 1992 to 1999 there has been a four-fold increase in ODA. No other donor country has such a rate of increase in the period. Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the increase in the period was from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the main factor in the increase in ODA this year and in the next two years is the Government's agreement to planned increases in Vote 39 in the period 1999 to 2001. This commitment is very valuable. Not only does it provide the single biggest set of increases in the history of Irish aid but it allows for the first time for multi-annual budgeting for long-term, sustainable development programmes in our priority countries, which are among the poorest in the world. This applies also to what we provide to deal with man-made and natural emergencies, for our voluntary contributions to UN and other multilateral aid agencies, for the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, and for our assistance through NGOs. Importantly too, these increases are in addition to the package announced some months ago for debt relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been agreed is that the aid allocation administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs will amount to £400 million in the period 1999 to 2001. Specifically, the aid subheads of Vote 39, the Vote for International Co-operation, subheads C to G inclusive, will amount to £104.374 million in 1999, with the carry-over of commitments from 1998, the actual spend in 1999 will be over £108 million. The allocation for the year 2000 will be £136.400 million and £159.200 in 2001, an increase next year of over 30 per cent and an increase of 17 per cent the following year. This will be in addition to contributions by other Departments to multilateral institutions such as the global environment facility or those under the Food Aid Convention of the World Food Pro<Col N="1209" /> gramme. This agreement underpins the growth of the aid programme. It allows us to continue to work to reach the interim target of 0.45 per cent of GNP during the lifetime of this Government and moves us further to the ultimate goal of the level set by the UN of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The arrangement now in place allows for a clear focus on continuing to develop a quality programme in keeping with the proud record of Irish involvement in developing countries.</P>

In the course of the protest, the Israeli Ambassador was informed that the Irish Government viewed the incident as most serious, that the pattern of shell strikes clearly indicated that the UN position was the identified target, that this indiscriminate attack by Israeli forces and their associates marks a very dangerous change of policy in their operations in South Lebanon and that it was very fortunate that in this instance there was no loss of life. The ambassador was asked to bring the contents of the protest to the attention of his authorities.</P>

It is a requirement of the Agreement that all the necessary legislative and other arrangements be in place to enable the implementation bodies to function at the time of its entry into force.</P>
      <P>I trust that the House will appreciate that I cannot at this stage enter into detail on the arrangements currently under discussion in regard to the individual bodies, including those for inland waterways and for language. While the publicly-owned limited company in the tourism area which was agreed on 18 December does not require legislative and other preparations absolutely equivalent to those being undertaken for the implementation bodies, work to enable its formation is being carried actively forward by officials at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I remain deeply concerned by the human rights situation in Burma. In my statement to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York last September, I drew attention to this issue and urged the need for international action. Of particular concern in this regard is the deplorable treatment by the military regime in Rangoon of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy.</P>
      <P>The Government's position in relation to Burma is based on the common position adopted by the European Union in October 1996. This common position stressed the Union's profound concern at the continuing deterioration of the political situation in Burma including the restrictions imposed on fundamental rights of freedom such as speech, movement and assembly. It put in place an arms embargo together with a suspension of non-humanitarian aid or development programmes, imposed various restrictions on the military in Burma and urged the regime to restore democracy without delay and to respect human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU common position was renewed for a further six months at the General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on 26 October 1998. It was strengthened by a widening of the visa ban to <Col N="1211" /> include transit visas explicitly under the current ban and by an extension of the ban to cover Burmese authorities in the tourism sector. I have made it clear to our EU partners that Ireland supports a further strengthening and broadening of the sanctions against the Burmese regime by extending the present measures to include restrictions on trade and investment.</P>
    <P>The question of Burmese participation in the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting scheduled to be held in Berlin on 30 March is currently creating serious difficulties in relations between the EU and the ASEAN countries. Ireland is among those countries who hold that the EU common position ought to be upheld &ndash; even if that were to put the holding of the Foreign Ministers meeting in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to avail of every opportunity to work for an improvement of the human rights situation in Burma and to do all it can to assist the democratic movement in that country. The leader of the Burmese democratic government-in-exile, Dr Sein Win, is due to visit Ireland next month. I propose to have substantive discussions with him in order to determine how Ireland can be of assistance to his efforts to bring democracy to his country.</P>

      <P>The Government and our European partners have, in our Declaration of 11 February, registered our dismay and utmost disappointment at the recent outbreak of open war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. This has happened despite intensive efforts by the Organisation of African Unity to mediate a peaceful settlement with strong support from the EU and other members of the international community. The current escalation into full-scale war is a futile effort to resolve political issues by military means and is already having an unacceptable impact on innocent civilians. Neither country can afford to bear the cost in humanitarian, economic or political terms.</P>
      <P>The immediate priority is to halt the conflict. As a first step, the EU has called upon both sides to agree unilaterally to a cessation of hostilities and for all States to end immediately the sale of arms and munitions to the two countries involved. We consider it imperative that further loss of human life and material destruction be prevented and that the safety of the civilian population be assured. The way to a negotiated settlement must be reopened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> Along with our European partners, the Government support strongly the efforts of the Heads of State and Secretary General of the Organisation of African Unity to bring about an unconditional ceasefire and to resume the mediation process. We are also actively pursuing this with the two Governments involved and through our support for UN Security Council Resolution 1227 of 29 January. We are ready to dispatch a special EU Troika mission in order to support a rapid resolution of the conflict on the basis of the existing OAU proposals for a framework for agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated previously, most recently in my written reply of yesterday to Deputy Kenny, the Government wishes to see an end to the US embargo imposed against Cuba. We are working to that end in concert with our European Union partners. In the UN General Assembly on 13 October 1998, Ireland voted with our EU partners in favour of Resolution 53/4 which called for an end to the embargo. The resolution was adopted with a significantly increased majority over its predecessor &ndash; 157 votes in favour, 2 against, with 12 abstentions. This compares with 143 in favour, 3 against and 17 abstentions in 1997.</P>
      <P>Some progress has been made towards reviewing the embargo. I have already welcomed President Clinton's announcement of 20 March 1998 on the opening of a number of contacts with Cuba. Last month, the US announced proposals for further measures, including fewer restrictions on flights to Cuba and on remittances to Cubans, a direct mail service with the island and a system that allows private Cuban entities to buy US food and agricultural inputs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are aware that, under Ireland's EU Presidency of 1996, the EU adopted a common position on Cuba. The common position defines the EUs objective in its relations with Cuba as the facilitation of a peaceful transition to democracy and a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people. The common position also makes clear that the EUs aim is to encourage a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict, bloodshed and mass emigration. But the common position also makes clear that wholehearted co-operation with Cuba <Col N="1213" /> is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent absence of fundamental human and political rights.</P>
    <P>We look forward to an improvement in the human rights situation in Cuba. In the meantime, the EU position remains as set out in its common position, as reiterated by the General Affairs Council on 7 December last. Havana must also play its part if Cuba wishes its international relations to be more significantly improved. For its part, the EU &ndash; in line with its policy of encouragement rather than isolation &ndash; has acceded to Cuba's request for observer status, as of 30 September last, at the negotiations for a new Lome Convention. Full membership of the Convention &ndash; and other full co-operation &ndash; must depend on real, substantial progress in respecting human rights and democracy.</P>
    <P>While resource constraints have precluded the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations with Cuba, the position is being kept under continuing review.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns in relation to the continued sale of arms and military equipment to Turkey by a number of countries including the United States and Germany; if he will urge other countries to cease these exports in view of Turkey's human rights record and its continued military operations against the Kurds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed in relation to the sale of arms and military equipment by some countries to Turkey. So far as the EU is concerned all transfers or sales of arms and military equipment are governed by the provisions of the EU code of conduct. The code of conduct is based on a number of criteria, one of which relates to human rights. The provisions of the code of conduct should be strictly implemented, and I have no reason to believe that this is not the case in this matter.</P>
      <P>Ireland and the EU have regularly raised with the Turkish authorities the issue of the protection and implementation of human rights in Turkey, particularly as they affect the Kurdish population of south-east Turkey. While the EU has indicated that it upholds the territorial integrity of Turkey and condemns terrorism, it has consistently been made clear to Turkey that the fight against terrorism must be conducted with due respect for human rights and the rule of law. Ireland, along with its European partners, has conveyed to the Turkish Government its view that a political solution must be found to the situation in south-east Turkey. Ireland continues to urge this approach on the Turkish authorities.</P>

      <P>As of January 1999, the amount owing to Ireland by the UN arising from our participation in peacekeeping operations was IR£7.6 million. Most of these arrears are owed in respect of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), a peacekeeping operation to which Ireland provides a troop battalion of some 620 personnel, our most significant commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security under the UN Charter. In the second half of 1998, the UN repaid arrears to Ireland totalling some IR£5.2 million.</P>
      <P>Despite the significant repayments made by the UN last year, and the continuing downward trend in the overall amount owing to Ireland, the issue of arrears remains of considerable concern. This matter is pursued on an ongoing basis by the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York. We have consistently stated our view that every effort should be made by the UN to reduce the amount of arrears owing to troop-contributing countries such as Ireland. In the course of the visit to Ireland by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan last month, I again raised Irelands concerns regarding arrears. The Secretary General indicated that he appreciated our concerns, and that he has been working towards improving the arrears situation.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the problem of arrears owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries is a result of the financial crisis which the UN has been experiencing for the last number of years, and is not due to any unwillingness on the part of the UN Secretariat to clear arrears. The financial crisis has been caused by the failure of many member states, and in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. The overall problem of arrears owing to the UN has led to a situation in which the Secretary General has been forced to delay normal reimbursements to troop contributors in order to deal with the serious day-to-day cash flow situation facing the UN system. Ireland, along with our EU partners, is firm in the demand that all member states of the UN should honour promptly and in full their financial obligations to the Organisation under the UN Charter, and we have repeatedly lobbied UN member states regarding the payment of arrears.</P>
      <P>We hope that efforts to resolve the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries. Ireland's permanent mission to the UN in New York will continue to make regular representations in this context.</P>

      <P>As I have already mentioned in my reply to priority questions, the Government attaches the highest priority to the speedy implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. We are working closely with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to ensure that we achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>I have outlined earlier the considerable progress we have made on the implementation process. The key remaining issue is the formation of the shadow executive and decommissioning. The mechanism established to deal with the decommissioning issue is the International Commission on Decommissioning, chaired by General John de Chasterlain. The Government is also working with the International Commission, the British Government and the relevant parties to try to find a way forward. At this stage, I do not envisage a role for Senator George Mitchell in resolving the impasse, but again I would wish to pay the warmest tribute to him for his enormous work on, and contribution to, the peace process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, in the first instance like to confirm to the Deputy that racism and xenophobia are matters of concern to this Government as well as all our European partners. Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs in September 1997 there have been no discussions at the General Affairs Council on racism and xenophobia.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy should be aware that the General Affairs Council, at its meeting on 2 June 1997, approved the establishment of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. The centre opened in January 1998 and is based in Vienna. The primary objective of the monitoring centre is to provide the Community and its member states with objective, reliable and comparable data at European level on the phenomena of racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism in order to help them when they take measures or formulate courses of action within their respective spheres of competence.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supported the establishment the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and we will continue to support action at EU level aimed at combating racism and xenophobia.</P>
      <P>I should also like to advise the Deputy that the 1996 EU Joint Action on Racism and Xenophobia continues to be pursued in the context of the Justice and Home Affairs Council. The joint action was aimed at improving judicial co-operation between member states in the fight against racism and xenophobia and the report presented to the May 1998 JHA Council indicated that member states have, to a very large extent, implemented the provisions of the joint action. A further review of this joint action is due at the end of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusions, which emerged from the Vienna European Council last December, underlined the need to combat all manifestations of racism, xenophobia and antisemitism, both in the European Union and in third countries. It emphasised the role of the Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in this regard. The European Council also invited the Commission to draft proposals for its Cologne meeting for measures to counter racism in the candidate countries and invited the member states to con<Col N="1218" /> sider taking similar measures inside the Union.  While further initiatives in the area of racism and xenophobia are most likely to be advanced under the guidance of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, rather than the General Affairs Council, I can assure the Deputy that I will take all the steps open to me to assist and support this work.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided for the establishment of an Independent Commission on Policing to make recommendations for future policing structures and arrangements in Northern Ireland, including means of encouraging widespread community support for these arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Commission, under the chairmanship of the former Governor of Hong Kong, Mr. Chris Patten, will make proposals in its report this summer to ensure that policing structures and arrangements, including composition, recruitment, training, culture, ethos and symbols, are such that, in a new approach Northern Ireland has a police service that can enjoy widespread support from, and be seen as an integral part of, the community as a whole. As the body charged with making these proposals, the commission has sought to consult widely with all relevant parties, groups and organisations, including the Government. The commission met with officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform last September. On that occasion, the Government clearly set out to the commission its view of the need for fundamental changes to ensure, as mandated by the Agreement, a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs also discusses policing issues on a regular basis with a range of contacts in Northern Ireland. Policing issues are likewise regularly raised within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>I intend to reply to Questions Nos. 62 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of proposals made by the former Costa Rican President Arias-Sanchez in 1997 on a Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers. Ireland has long been active at the United Nations in pursuing the issue of arms transfers, including the tabling of our own proposal for a code of conduct in the First Committee. Our interest and involvement is reflected in the fact that Ireland is currently chairing the United Nations Disarmament Commissions Working Group on Conventional Arms.</P>
      <P>With regard to discussions in the European Union, the Government has pressed strongly for greater priority to be given in the EU to more effective controls over arms transfers.</P>
      <P>The last year has witnessed agreement within the European Union on a Code of Conduct on arms exports. Ireland made a considerable contribution in the elaboration of this code. The further development of this instrument and its adoption as a code of conduct by other states is currently being pursued by the European Union.</P>
      <P>I am currently examining with my colleagues from Canada and Norway steps to develop the broader issue of human security including the question of small arms. The international conference to address the issue of small arms scheduled for 2000 will provide a singular opportunity for further action in this regard.</P>

      <P>My visit to Honduras on 12-13 January enabled me to see at first hand the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch. Despite a remarkable clean-up effort by the Hondurans themselves, the extent of the damage, particularly to infrastructure, is still readily visible, including in and around the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compared to the impact of the last major hurricane to hit Honduras (Hurricane Fifi in 1974), <Col N="1220" /> Hurricane Mitch was much more destructive because it remained stationary over the country for several days and its path was so wide that it covered practically the whole country. The equivalent of two years rain fell over 4-5 days. Most of the damage inflicted on the national road infrastructure, housing and agricultural sector was caused by the extensive flood waters and landslides.</P>
    <P>A major preoccupation for the Government is the rehabilitation of the productive sectors of the economy and employment creation. The Honduran economy is heavily reliant on the agricultural sector, and damage to the banana and coffee plantations was extensive.</P>
    <P>I informed the Honduran Government of the decision by the Minister for Defence to make available a group of volunteers from the Irish Army to help in the construction of a medical centre and school in Santa Rosa Aguan destroyed by Hurricane Mitch. The Army unit is now in place.</P>
    <P>I was briefed by the heads of APSO, Trócaire, Concern and GOAL on their activities in Honduras. APSO and Trócaire, who were already active in Honduras before the Hurricane, have had to refocus their priorities in the short-term towards emergency work. While in Honduras, I announced the provision of an additional £200,000 in grants towards the emergency effort bringing the total for humanitarian assistance thus far granted to the region to £750,000.</P>
    <P>The Government intends to remain engaged with the reconstruction effort and is open to providing further aid, especially for rehabilitation. With this in mind an Irish Aid technical team will leave shortly for the region. The Irish Aid team will conduct the necessary professional assessment of current and longer term needs so that decisions can be taken on how best we can contribute to the international reconstruction and rehabilitation effort.</P>
    <P>I also visited Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda. These visits were intended to develop Irelands relations in the Caribbean, where we have a very low level of diplomatic representation. The visit was extremely useful in establishing a basis for political and economic cooperation with this region. Among the issues discussed with ministerial contacts were EU-ACP relations, preparations for the EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit which will be held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1999 and the development of bilateral economic and diplomatic relations. I also took the opportunity to seek the support of these countries for Irelands bid for election to the UN Security Council in 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken in the House on many occasions on the subject of the relatively high motor insurance burden borne by young Irish motorists. I have made reference to the 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on insurance costs which confirms that motor insurance costs in EU countries are high for all young drivers, relative to rates charged to more mature motorists. Viewing this matter in a global context, insurers tend to classify young and/or inexperienced drivers as a high risk category relative to the more mature and/or experienced driver. Adverse statistics relating to claims frequency and claims for young drivers have been noted and enumerated in this House, and it is evident that the key to reducing insurance costs for young drivers is to improve their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among young drivers including a scheme of insurance premium discounts by the insurance industry, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, on completion of a required number of driving lessons, road safety educational programmes for students, advertising campaigns by the National Safety Council to discourage speeding and the examination by the Department of Environment and Local Government of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers. In addition, I have re-established the <Col N="1223" /> Motor Insurance Advisory Board which is to advise me on the charges for and the methods for providing motor insurance between different risk categories of drivers having regard to accidents and claims.</P>
    <P>Certain concessions to young drivers have been introduced by major insurers in the Irish market against the background of increasing underwriting losses in motor insurance. The 1997 Annual Insurance Report prepared by our Department, showed underwriting losses increased from £90 million in 1996 to £114 million in 1997. The deteriorating underwriting situation led some insurers to announce increases in certain insurance categories in 1998. In those circumstances, any discounts offered to young drivers, must effectively be subsidised by lower-risk categories of motorists. It does not make good commercial sense, nor is it equitable, that safer drivers should subsidise less responsible drivers. That simply reduces the incentive for safe driving among all classes of motorists, leading to increased claims costs and a progressive deterioration in the insurers' underwriting account. The end result is that average motor insurance premiums operate at a higher level than would otherwise obtain if the principle of risk-based premium-setting were strictly applied to all motor insurance categories.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to establish a State company which would give insurance to young people. In order to operate on a normal commercial basis, the reality of high claims costs leading to high insurance premiums for young drivers would become apparent to any such company. There is clearly no soft option for reducing their motor insurance premiums. As a group, they represent a very high risk for insurers and many insurance companies are reluctant to quote. As with any other insurance risk, reductions in premiums can only be achieved by improved safety standards and, in the case of the young Irish motorist, the inculcation of safer driving standards and education in driving skills are the keys to reducing their high accident rate which, in turn, should lead to lower premium quotations.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of the case of the late Sean Sellars, who was executed on 4 February 1999 in Oklahoma, USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also fully aware of the strong concerns which were raised and in particular the fact that Mr. Sellars had been sentenced to death for <Col N="1225" /> crimes which he committed when aged 16. I fully share those concerns and note that Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &ndash; to which the United States is a party &ndash; expressly forbids the execution of persons whose crime was committed when aged under 18. While recognising that the United States has made a reservation to the article in question, I further noted that the US had not executed a prisoner for a crime committed at the age of 16 since 1959.</P>
    <P>As our partners in the European Union share our strong concerns regarding the human rights issues in this case, it was agreed that the matter should be raised at EU level. To this end, the current Presidency of the European Union (Germany) was mandated by all member states to carry out a démarche to the US authorities at federal and state level, informing the authorities of the EU's concerns and of our collective view that the imposition of the death penalty in this case was contrary to international norms and calling for commutation of the death sentence to life imprisonment. Regrettably, despite this and other pleas for clemency, the State authorities in Oklahoma chose to proceed with the execution as scheduled on 4 February.</P>
    <P>Following the execution of Sean Sellars despite EU démarches at State and Federal level, EU partners agreed that it would be appropriate to issue a public statement expressing our common deep concern and regret. We viewed the execution as a serious regression in efforts to achieve international abolition of the death penalty. An agreed statement reflecting these concerns was issued by the European Union on 11 February 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the distribution of Irish aid through a number of disbursement channels represents an appropriate response to the needs of developing countries. A key consideration is that the aid relationship should be based on a partnership between developed and developing countries. The management of aid should reflect the perceptions and priorities of recipient countries. Aid should be seen as supporting &ndash; not as substituting for &ndash; the efforts of developing countries. A key objective should be to strengthen the institutional and administrative capacities of developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuit of these objectives, and in common with other donors, Irish aid is distributed through three main channels. First, funding through multilateral organisations enables Irish aid to reach the entire range of developing countries and to participate in large-scale development activities that would be impossible to undertake alone. Second, the concentration of a proportion of our budget on six priority countries in Africa has enabled Irish aid to engage in direct development partnerships with some of the worlds poorest countries. Third, the allocation of a high proportion of our funding by international standards through non-governmental organisations enables Irish aid to address the needs of some of the poorest and most marginalised groups in developing countries <Col N="1228" /> and to provide support for the development of civil society.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the distribution of Irish aid has been about two thirds bilateral and one third multilateral, with about 23 per cent of the bilateral portion going through NGOs.</P>

      <P>I reiterate the Government's total opposition to the use of the death penalty and to assure the Deputy that we are in regular contact with other governments in our efforts to promote universal abolition of its use.</P>
      <P>In co-operation with EU partners, we have drawn up agreed guidelines on the death penalty which promote its abolition and, where states insist on its retention, seek the upholding of basic minimum standards. The EU continues to press for abolition and in the past six months has issued démarches on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries including, <i>inter alia</i>, the Sudan, Benin, Iran, Russia, Ukraine, the Palestinian Authority, the Philippines, Sierra Leone and the United States. EU policy in this area also dictates that countries should be given every assistance in introducing a moratorium or abolishing capital punishment. In this regard, we have publicly welcomed and supported such decisions in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Kirgizstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.</P>
      <P>In a UN context, Ireland will also continue to play a leading role in support of universal abolition of the death penalty. At the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the EU will sponsor a resolution on this issue. In the past, Ireland was one of the strongest sponsors of this resolution and we welcome the fact that it has now been taken on as an EU initiative. We hope to build on the success we have achieved to date and persuade more governments to reject the use of this cruel punishment.</P>

      <P>Negotiations between the EU and ACP states on a successor framework to the Lomé IV Convention opened in Brussels on 30 September 1998. Three negotiating groups have been established including groups on the private sector, economic <Col N="1229" /> and trade issues and financial co-operation. There is, in addition to these three, a central group to which the others report. The negotiations con-tinued at a recent informal ministerial conference in Dakar, Senegal between 8-9 February and are set to continue at official level in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the contents of the EU mandate for the negotiations and played an active role in the negotiation of this mandate. In broad terms, the EU mandate advocates intensified and expanded political dialogue, a new approach to economic partnership with a recognition of the potential of regional integration among ACP states and simplified development co-operation instruments. The mandate proposes that a new Convention should have strong essential elements including human rights, good governance and democracy.</P>
      <P>At Dakar, there was broad agreement in principle on the structure of the next Lomé, on the objectives of the partnership and on the need for strengthened political dialogue. One of the key objectives of the agreement will be that of vigorously tackling poverty in ACP states involving economic, political and social programmes in the context of advancing sustainable development. In order to advance this objective, there was general agreement at Dakar on the need to rationalise and simplify EU co-operation instruments with the ACP states but precise details remain to be worked out.</P>
      <P>The EU mandate proposes that the current non-reciprocal trade arrangements on market access will remain in force until 2005 but that a new regime will be negotiated between 2000-05. Under this approach after 2005 ACP countries would either participate in Free Trade Areas, benefit from strengthened Least Developed Country trade provisions or, for those not in Free Trade Areas or LDC, GSP would apply. The mandate provides, in general terms, that any new arrangements should at least maintain current market access arrangements for the ACP countries.</P>
      <P>Much work remains to be done and clearly there are divergences particularly in respect of trade issues. There is however broad agreement on the main parameters of a new Lomé framework. Ireland will continue to play its part in seeking a new agreement which advances the EU-ACP partnership while protecting the economies of the least developed countries.</P>

      <P>The Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund is designed to respond to both natural and man-made disasters by providing the basic needs necessary to sustain and protect life and reduce suffering.

      <P>The number of emergencies, including natural disasters, around the world is always going to exceed available funding and it is therefore never going to be possible to respond positively in every case. However, during the period since January 1998, funding has been provided to the main areas affected by natural disasters such as Central America, Bangladesh and China. A list of these countries and the amount of assistance provided accompanies this reply. A second list includes countries where the need for aid is caused by a combination of man-made and natural factors. In addition, assistance is provided for post-emergency rehabilitation of areas affected by both natural disasters and conflict. Details of assistance provided prior to 1998 are published in Irish Aid's annual reports which are available in the Oireachtas library.</P>

      <P>Ireland has been consistent in its support to the people of Sudan over the past number of years and continues to commit substantial funds to the international humanitarian relief effort through the UN and Irish and international NGOs. Since 1994 Ireland has provided over £3.29 million in emergency assistance. In 1998 alone the Government provided over £1.6 million. A recent Irish Aid technical mission to south Sudan recommended that significant assistance should be continued in 1999. This assistance will be channelled through the relevant UN agencies and NGOs operational in Sudan.</P>
      <P>Although the current humanitarian situation has stabilised, there is still cause for concern. While Bahr el Ghazal is the worst hit area, other regions such as Upper Nile and the Nuba Mountains, where access is difficult, are experiencing food shortages. In this regard the recent decision to allow a UN needs assessment mission to the Nuba mountains in March is a positive development.</P>
      <P>The Government and SPLA have agreed to agreed to extend the humanitarian ceasefire until April 1999. However, the Government would like to see it extended in time and geographical area in order to allow people to sow and harvest their crops and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. We also continue to back efforts to find a political solution, without which the sustainability of what is a massive aid operation becomes questionable. The only viable way forward for the people of Sudan is for an end to the conflict and the beginning of meaningful political negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Government, together with its European partners, has been taking a close interest in the trials of those accused in connection with the bombings which took place last June in Khartoum. We have been especially concerned that those accused were being tried by military court, could possibly be subjected to the death penalty and have had only limited access to lawyers. These concerns have been heightened by reports that confessions were extracted from the accused under torture. The fact that, if convicted, they have no means of appeal, runs contrary to the right of higher judicial review enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Sudan is a party.</P>
      <P>I have raised these concerns at the General Affairs Council and they are now being addressed in the Union's ongoing contacts with the Sudanese authorities. In addition, they are being pursued by the Irish Ambassador in Cairo who is accredited to Sudan as well as to Egypt. At my request, he has been monitoring the relevant cases since last year. The Papal Nuncio to Sudan, who is dealing with this matter on behalf of the Vatican authorities, is reported to have spent some time with the accused. At present, the competence of the military tribunal to hear their cases is under review by the constitutional court which has not yet delivered its verdict. Pending the outcome of that verdict I am told that some priest colleagues have been able to accompany lawyers visiting the accused in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will continue its efforts, both bilaterally and in conjunction with EU partners, to urge the Sudanese authorities to reconsider these cases in accordance with international standards of human rights and justice. We will closely monitor any future hearings. It is our hope that this can help to ensure a fair trial for those accused as well as contribute to building the con<Col N="1233" /> fidence necessary for lasting peace with justice for all people of Sudan.</P>

      <P>I remain deeply concerned at the human rights situation in Burma. I am aware also that Burma is a major centre for the production of opium and heroin for delivery to European countries.</P>
      <P>The Government's position in relation to Burma is based on the common position adopted by the European Union in October 1996. This common position stressed the Unions profound concern at the continuing deterioration of the political situation in Burma including the restrictions imposed on fundamental rights of freedom such as speech, movement and assembly. It put in place an arms embargo together with a suspension of non-humanitarian aid or development programmes, imposed various restrictions on the military in Burma and urged the regime to restore democracy without delay and to respect human rights.</P>
      <P>The EU common position was renewed for a further six months at the General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on 26 October 1998. It was strengthened by a widening of the visa ban to include transit visas explicitly under the current ban and by an extension of the ban to cover Burmese authorities in the tourism sector. I have made it clear to our EU partners that Ireland supports a further strengthening and broadening of the sanctions against the Burmese regime by extending the present measures to include restrictions on trade and investment.</P>
      <P>The question of drugs trafficking between Burma and the EU is a matter of serious concern and is the subject of frequent discussions among EU partners. Every effort is being made by the police and customs authorities within the Union to restrict this heinous trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations Population Fund &ndash; UNFPA &ndash; was established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966 to provide assistance in the field of population. It extends assistance to developing countries at their request to help them to address reproductive health and population issues and seeks to raise awareness of these issues in all countries. UNFPA's three main objectives <Col N="1234" /> are to help ensure universal access to reproductive health, including family planning and sexual health, to all couples and individuals on the basis of individual choice by the year 2015, and to formulate and support population strategies that promote sustainable development. to promote awareness of population and development issues and to seek to mobilise the resources and political will necessary to accomplish its work.</P>
      <P>UNFPA runs extensive campaigns and assistance programmes in Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa with those developing countries which request its advice and assistance. It is committed by its mandates to the principles of voluntarism in all of its programmes of assistance and its projects are grounded on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. Its policy, as laid down by its Governing Council in 1985, specifically states that UNFPA is not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services or abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning.</P>
      <P>UNFPA is financed from contributions by Governments and private donors. Prior to 1993, Ireland was the only EU member state not to have contributed to UNFPA. Given the growing importance of the population issue at international level, it was felt by the Government at that time that a contribution to UNFPA represented an appropriate response to the challenge posed by population growth, particularly in developing countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland has since provided annual contributions of £50,000 in 1993, £150,000 in 1994, £250,000 in both 1995 and 1996, £275,000 in 1997 and £308,000 in 1998, representing a total contribution of £1.283 million to UNFPA over that period. It is proposed to provide a further contribution to UNFPA in 1999.</P>
      <P>Ireland is currently a member of the executive board of UNFPA/UNDP for the period 1998-2000.</P>

      <P>A meeting was held on 12 February between the Minister for State at the Department, Deputy Liz ODonnell, and the relatives of Pat Finucane. Representatives of British-Irish Rights Watch, the Committee on the Administration of Justice and the law firm of Madden and Finucane were also present. At this meeting, a copy of a new report into the death of Pat Finucane was handed over to the Government. I understand that a copy was also given later that day to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The report, entitled Deadly Intelligence, State Involvement in Loyalist Murder in Northern Ireland, was written by British-Irish Rights Watch. It alleges that new information has come to light regarding the involvement of the security forces in the murder of Pat Finucane. It focuses in particular on the alleged activities of a section of British military intelligence known as the Force Research Unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allegations made in this report are very serious and, if true, deeply disturbing. At the meeting with the relatives, the Government undertook to study the report carefully and as a matter of urgency. This is currently under way. The issue of the murder of Pat Finucane has in the past been raised with the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish <Col N="1236" /> Intergovernmental Conference. I expect that these new allegations will form the basis for renewed discussions with our British counterparts through the conference on the basis of our assessment of the British-Irish Rights Watch report.</P>

Offers were made to successful applicants to conclude contracts with the ESB to generate electricity from 29 MW of CHP capacity in AER I, of which 18 MW has been delivered. The AER IV competition, the results of which were announced in August 1998, produced offers of up to 50 MW. These latter projects must be operational by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Irish Energy Centre is currently providing support for an additional 22 MW of CHP capacity which will also be operational by the end of this year. The centre continues to promote CHP because it is a proven and reliable technology which reduces energy costs. Accordingly, by the end of 1999, up to 90MW of additional CHP capacity will have been installed.</P>
      <P>As to district heating, this has been most successful in regions which have colder climates and higher population densities than Ireland. Further consideration will be given to CHP and district heating in the Green Paper on sustainable energy which I hope to publish in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service &ndash; IMES &ndash; of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for all aspects of oil pollution of the sea and coastal areas. One of the tasks assigned by Government to the Defence Forces is to provide, when requested, assistance in the area of pollution control at sea. The Naval Service maintains a number of maxi-kits at the Naval Base, Haulbowline, which can be deployed on board Naval Service vessels and used to spray dispersants on oil slicks <Col N="1239" /> if requested to do so by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Dispersants can be pumped through spray nozzles on booms, which can project from the side of Naval Service ships, and be mixed with the oil on the surface of the water through trailing otter-boards. This action has the effect of breaking up the oil. In addition the Naval Service has a number of floating booms which can be deployed around a vessel in order to contain an oil leak.</P>
    <P>While the Naval Service is not equipped with oil skimmers, such equipment is available to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the reduction in the EU farm retirement pension is based on the gross pension rather than on the net pension which is actually paid to the farmer in cases where the recipient is also in receipt of a social welfare pension from the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the rules of the scheme of early retirement from farming any national retirement pensions paid to participants must be deducted from the early retirement pension. The early retirement scheme is an EU wide measure and does not take into account the various tax regimes in member states. The pension amounts used, therefore, in relation to any applications under the scheme is the amount of pension payable before any deductions for tax etc. i.e. the gross pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a <Col N="1248" /> broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.</P>
    <P>A geriatric day hospital is being put in place at Waterford Regional Hospital which will provide services for elderly patients including those suffering from Alzheimer's disease.</P>
    <P>In 1999 the South Eastern Health Board will be appointing a consultant psychiatrist with a special interest in older people and a specific remit for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. I understand that interviews were held recently for the recruitment to the South Eastern Health Board of three consultant physicians with a special interest in geriatric medicine.</P>
    <P>In 1999 the South Eastern Health Board will provide a grant of £3,500 to the Alzheimer's Society Waterford Branch.</P>
    <P>This year I made an additional allocation of £50,000 to the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland which brings their total annual grant to £230,000. In addition £20,000 has been allocated to the Western Alzheimer's Association on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Under the scheme grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of <Col N="1250" /> doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; or &ldquo;panic button&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck.</P>
      <P>To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people, aged 65 or over must be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves.</P>
      <P>In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Older people who wish to apply for a grant under the scheme should contact the voluntary group or organisation in their local area prior to the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment.</P>
      <P>No application was received under the scheme in 1998 from any voluntary group or organisation in County Sligo on behalf of the person named in the Deputy's question. I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
      <P>The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the operation of the scheme in 1999 will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. At the end of 1998, over 530,000 free travel passes had been issued at an annual cost of £32.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is available to all people living in the State, aged 66 years or over and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance. From April 1999, <Col N="1251" /> the scheme will be available to carers of people in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of one of the following qualifying payments: invalidity pension; blind person's pension; disability allowance; unemployability supplement or workmen's compensation and supplement with disablement pension, for at least 12 months. A social security invalidity/incapacity pension-benefit, or an equivalent payment, for at least 12 months from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
    <P>People, including public servants, suffering from ill-health who do not fulfil the necessary PRSI conditions will not qualify for invalidity pension. However, disability allowance is paid to people, including public servants, with a disability who are aged 16 or over and under 66. Their disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent budget provided the biggest ever social welfare budget allocation, amounting to over £305 million on a full year basis. Of this allocation, the cost of the various increases in weekly social welfare payments, including FIS improvements, comes to almost £206 million on a full year basis, or almost £4 million per week. Accordingly, the cost of bringing forward the budget increases from the beginning of June to, say, the beginning <Col N="1252" /> of April, 1999 would amount to almost £32 million.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of carer's allowance is that the claimant is providing full-time care and attention to the person being cared for. The person concerned first applied for a carer's allowance in May 1998.

On this basis the person concerned did not fulfil the statutory conditions of the scheme, and her claim was refused. She did not appeal this decision.</P>
      <P>The person concerned submitted a second application for carer's allowance in December 1998. In view of the previous circumstances, her situation was re-investigated by a local inspector of the Department.

      <P>It is clear from the substantial annual assistance provided from Ciste na Gaeilge, subhead J of my Department's Vote, to the voluntary Irish language organisations, which amounted to £2,306,400 in 1998, that my Department strongly supports their activities in relation to the promotion of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>As regards my views on proposals for their future role and responsibility I am not clear as to what the Deputy has in mind. If he is referring to the proposal that the Irish language pillar of the North/South Language Body to be established under the Agreement of 18 December should be responsible for the funding of voluntary Irish language organisations operating on an all-Ireland basis, I would see this as an interesting prospect. I should add, however, that no decision has yet been made regarding that matter, either in general terms or on particular aspects of its implementation.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that, up to and including 1 December 1998, Garda returns indicate that there were no reported incidents of such attacks upon women.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the classification of controlled substances, under the Misuse of Drugs Act, is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children, and my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has informed me that Flunitrazepam, which is the active ingredient in Rohypnol and its preparations, was reclassified in this country in 1993 in response to various reports of misuse. As a result, unauthorised possession is an offence and it has been made more difficult for drug misusers to gain access to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children has also informed me that doctors prescribing Rohypnol must comply with the special prescription writing requirements, as set out in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988, and furthermore that persons such as doctors and pharmacists having the drug in their lawful possession must keep it in safe custody in accordance with the requirements of the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) Regulations, 1982.</P>
      <P>The main group who misuse Rohypnol are injecting opiate misusers and I am informed that experts in the Eastern Health Board, working with doctors dealing with this group, advise that doctors should not prescribe the drugs to opiate misusers because of the potential for its misuse. I have also been given to understand that the manufacturers of Rohypnol have taken certain steps to ensure that it is detectable where it is covertly administered to an individual's drink. The Minister for Health and Children has informed me that his Department will be monitoring the prescribing of controlled drugs to try and ensure that they are not subject to abuse.</P>

      <P>Fireworks are classed as explosives under the Explosives Act, 1875. This Act requires a licence to be issued for the importation of explosives. These importation licences may be issued to organisers of fireworks displays conducted by professional operators, subject to certain conditions.</P>
      <P>However, despite these restrictions fireworks are imported illegally. The dangers imposed by these illegally imported fireworks are, of course, a matter of concern to both myself and the Garda authorities.

      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwellinghouses. Part III of the (No. 2) Act, provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner-occupiers of dwelling houses may acquire readily and relatively inexpensively the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases at present is about 1 3 times the ground rent. The Act contains provision for the determination of applications for the pur<Col N="1258" /> chase of the fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. There is no obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for its purchase without reference to the (No. 2) Act.</P>
      <P>A Bill entitled the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill passed Second Stage in the House on 19 March 1997. The detail of this Bill is being examined in my Department at present, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Registrar of Titles, particularly from the point of view of the constitutionality and practicality of its proposals in relation to land law generally and in particular the land registration system.</P>
      <P>A difficulty, which successive Governments have accepted over the years, is that abolition of ground rents without appropriate compensation would not be in keeping with constitutional requirements. Given the complexities involved, I am not yet in a position to indicate when the examination will be completed, but any proposals which may emerge will be announced in the usual way.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that pending the completion of that examination, I could not comment in detail on the particular constitutional issues in question other than to make the general point that successive Governments have accepted that the abolition of ground rents without appropriate compensation arrangements would not be in accordance with constitutional requirements.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, tuition fees are payable in respect of eligible EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding entry to their third level course. I would point out to the Deputy that this condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals. I understand that similar residency requirements operate in the other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The removal of this residency condition for Irish nationals would have to apply to EU nationals generally and could have significant resource implications for the Exchequer. The matter has been raised by a number of Deputies and I have asked my officials to re-examine the issue and report to me in due course.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for a maintenance grant under the terms of the student support schemes a candidate must fulfil conditions as to residence, age, academic attainments, means and nationality. To fulfil the residency requirement a candidate's parents, or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate herself/himself, shall have been resident in the administrative area of the local authority from the 1 October 1997. The local authority has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Candidates who are EU nationals and who do not satisfy the residency requirements under the free fees initiative are eligible to apply for a means tested fees only grant in respect of approved courses in the Republic of Ireland, provided they have been ordinarily resident, for a purpose other than wholly or mainly to receive full-time education, in an EU member state from 1 October of the year prior to entry to college.</P>

      <P>The special educational needs of pupils attending Scoil an Chroí Ró Naofa Íosa, Huntstown, will be considered in this context.

      <P>On 10 January I announced a new initiative on school ownership at primary and post-primary levels. In my statement, I indicated that discussions would be held with all interested parties on the operational arrangements for the new initiative. To this end, a working group has been established in my Department and is currently examining the implementation details. When this work has been finalised, my Department will be in a position to advance individual projects such as Piltown national school.</P>

      <P>Tá sé ar intinn agam forálacha uile an Acht Oideachais, 1998 a chur i bhfeidhm chomh luath agus is féidir, agus forálann an tAcht fhéin nach foláir do na forálacha uile teacht i bhfeidhm laistigh de dhá bhliain on dáta achtaithe. Maidir le cuid de na forálacha, áfach, ní féidir leo teacht i bhfeidhm gan pleanáil chúramach agus comhairle a bheith glactha leis na páirtithe oideachais agus páirtithe leasmhara eile. Tá alt 31 i measc na bhforálacha siúd, ó tharla go bhfuil ballraíocht an choiste i gceist, chomh maith le ceisteanna acmhainní agus na feidhmeanna ar leith a bheas ag an gcoiste. Dá bhrí sin, níl ar mo chumas fao láthair a rá cén uair go cruinn a bhunóidh mé an coiste nó cén bhallraíocht a bheas aige. Rachaidh mo Roinn i gcomhairle leis na páirtithe i gceist go rí-ghairid d'fhonn an coiste a chur ar gan mhoill.</P>
