      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What legislation is necessary and when will it be introduced to bring into force what is contained in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning regarding a new uniformed traffic warden system? About a week ago I raised the issue of 140 traffic wardens who will lose their jobs when they are transferred to Dublin Corporation because the director of traffic says they are not needed. Today's paper says the Government will announce in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto that new traffic wardens will be brought in to help the gardaí. Not only will they look after traffic, they will also carry out planning inspections. What legislation is needed? Is this Government policy or a Fianna Fáil election manifesto promise? I understand the gardaí have not really had any discussions with the Taoiseach about this proposal. If he announces it today and has to row back on it, it will not have been a good way to do business.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has told us legislation is needed. Will he be able to announce this scheme today before he even knows what legislation is necessary? Will the Taoiseach tell us about the planning elements of the work of these new traffic wardens?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should sort out rows between backbenchers who threaten to resign.</P>
      <P>Is there a proposal to amend the planning legislation? It is necessary to change planning legislation to give non-local authority staff the right to look after planning and development. My understanding is that no local authority knows anything about a change in the way they will carry out inspections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to confirm what the Taoiseach said yesterday in respect of the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill. I understand the Taoiseach confirmed yesterday that Government time will be made available for Second Stage of the Bill and that Government amendments will be taken in due course. I propose that Second Stage be taken between 8.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. next Tuesday subject to agreement between the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1101" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Next week's schedule has already been set. Much work requires to be done. Deputy Quinn has already accepted that the Bill needs to be substantially amended. However, I confirm what I said yesterday, namely, that the Bill will be taken and that the Government will amend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach has said and am conscious of the time pressures on everybody given that the House will go into recess in five or six weeks. I suggest that, if the time slot between 8.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. next Tuesday has not been filled &ndash; I gather it is free &ndash; Second Stage be taken on that date and that the necessary amendments which are in the course of preparation by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform be tabled in due course and referred to the committee. We can reach Committee Stage if we take Second Stage sometime next week. If the time slot on Tuesday is free, Second Stage could be disposed of without disagreement and work on Committee Stage, where the real changes have to be made, could commence and continue through July if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael regards this legislation as urgent and I support what Deputy Quinn said, namely, that there is no reason Second Stage cannot be taken next week. In that context our party will fully co-operate. I urge that Government time be given next week for Second Stage. If it is decided to take it on Tuesday evening, then so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on whether the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is ready. Yesterday I announced that we were prepared to take Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's Bill and we will work on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is all-party support for the Bill. I appreciate the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is overburdened with over 32 Bills in preparation. However, we are seeking a Second Stage debate with a speech and reply from the Minister with the clear intention that the Bill will be amended and will progress to Committee Stage. Between now and next Tuesday it should be possible for the Department to prepare a speech for Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look at that. I assume we are talking about Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's Bill &ndash; Deputy Shatter appeared with a Bill this morning. We are prepared to deal with Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael has a Bill on the Order Paper. We regard the matter as sufficiently urgent for us to deal with it in Private Members' time in the event of the Government not taking Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill next week. However, we fully <Col N="1102" /> accept that Deputy Jan O'Sullivan published the first Bill on the issue. We ask the Taoiseach to confirm to the House that Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill will be taken next Tuesday. If it is not taken, I will formally move the First Reading of our Bill. If the Taoiseach subsequently indicates that the Government will take Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill next week, we will not press the Bill next week in Private Members' time. This issue should not be left on the back burner; neither should it divide the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill should not divide the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to be constructive and helpful to people who draft Bills in the House, the Labour Party presented a Bill on this matter several weeks ago. That Bill has many deficiencies, something acknowledged by the Labour Party and something which is not unusual in terms of a Bill put forward by an Opposition Party. Yesterday I stated that we would take the Bill and amend it in committee. I will do that as soon as possible when we are ready. This morning Deputy Shatter appeared with a Bill and there seems to be an attempt to fix that into the time next week. Otherwise, Deputy Shatter said he would move the Bill in his party's Private Members' time, as is his prerogative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only way we can get the matter discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to have the issue addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants the issue to be addressed but, with the greatest respect, he must decide whether he is prepared to do what we are prepared to do, namely, work with Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill and not his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is giving no guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter must understand this; we will make a decision on Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is giving no guarantee that he will provide Government time for Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill before the House goes into recess for the summer. We have seen the Government's approach in the past to issues of this nature. For example, the Children Bill has been on the Order Paper for two years. As far as we are concerned this is an urgent issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy not do something himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that Deputy O'Sullivan has published a Bill which is on the Order Paper. Will the Taoiseach give the House a commitment that if he does not give Government <Col N="1103" /> time for the Bill next week, at a minimum he will provide Government time the following week? That would mean the issue could be addressed before the House goes into recess for the summer. It is not acceptable for the Taoiseach simply to indicate he will provide Government time on some unspecified date when the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform gets its act together. Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill has been published for nine months and has not yet been brought before the House. The Department has had nine months to consider amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 24 hours ago that the Private Members' Bill will be taken in Government time. Twenty four hours later I will not specify when that will be done. However, it will be done. We said we will accept the principle and heads of the Bill and work on that basis. We will also work out the time. If there is unanimity on the matter I do not understand why Deputy Shatter is being divisive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we want legislation. There has been waffle for years about protecting children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past when issues such as this have arisen the Taoiseach indicated that he would ask the Whips to discuss the matter. Will he give a commitment in relation to this Bill that the Whips will examine the proposal made by Deputy Quinn about taking it at 8.30 p.m. next Tuesday? He has not quite gone that far this morning. The Taoiseach is aware, in the context of the statements being taken later today, that the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill is very relevant to what has happened in our industrial schools and orphanages. It is time the legislation was dealt with and if there is unanimity it could be dealt with at 8.30 p.m. next Tuesday. This would not involve a great deal of work by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform other than a speech for Second Stage, something which should be possible. The Bill can then go to committee where the serious amendments which the Taoiseach said are necessary can be examined. I would like an indication that the Whips will discuss the matter.</P>

    <P>Is Bille gairid é seo agus is é an cuspóir atá <Col N="1110" /> leis ná an tréimhse ama incheadaithe is faide idir toghcháin d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a mhéadú ó cúig bliana go dtí cúig bliana agus sé mhí. Beidh níos mó le rá agam faoi seo ar ball.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach tá sé fógraithe agam anseo cheana go bhfuil an Rialtas tar éis toiliú le moltaí ón Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán maidir le hathstruchtúradh a dhéanamh ar Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá obair ar siúl i gcónaí chun críoch a chur le dréachtú Bille a dhéanfaidh leasú substaintiúil ar na hAchtanna um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979 go 1993, chun feidhm a thabhairt do chinntí an Rialtais i dtaobh na ceiste. Is trua nach bhfuil an Bille cuimsitheach réidh agus gur gá an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach a bhfuil de chuspóir leis ná toghchán an Údaráis a chur siar. Go príomha is í an chúis nach bhfuil an Bille cuimsitheach ullamh ná go raibh ar an bhfoireann sa Roinn atá ag plé leis an reachtaíocht sin tús áite a thabhairt don obair a bhain leis an bhforas Teanga Thuaidh Theas sa chéad ráithe den bhliain seo. Is mian liom a rá go soiléir nach bhfuil aon mhoill dhosheachanta á cur leis an mBille cuimsitheach sin. Bhí deis agam pairt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht a bhí ag an Rialtas faoi na moltaí i dtaca le hathstruchtúradh an dhéanamh ar an Údarás. Níl aon amhras orm ach go dtuigeann an Rialtas cé comh tábhachtach is atá na moltaí sin don Ghaeltacht. Freisin tá tacaíocht an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht le feiceáil sa soláthar airgid atá curtha ar fáil don Údarás agus do scéimeanna Gaeltachta mo Roinnese i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Is iad na leasuithe maidir le hathstruchtúradh de atá i gceist sa Bhille cuimsitheach ná: líon na gcomhaltaí tofa ar an Údarás a mhéadú; toghcheantar ar leith a bheith ann do gach contae Gaeltachta; agus na coisti réigiúnda de chuid an Údaráis a chur ar bhonn reachtúil. Nil i gceist agam tuilleadh a rá faoi na leasuithe sin inniu mar tá mé ag súil leis go bhfoilseofar an Bille go luath. Beidh deis ansin díospóireacht leathan a bheith againn maidir le ról an Údaráis, maidir leis an méid atá bainte amach ag an eagraíocht ó bunaíodh é beagnach fiche bliain ó shin agus, ar ndóigh, maidir leis na moltaí sonracha a bheidh sa Bhille. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé ag tnúth leis an díospóireacht sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom anois filleadh ar an mBille atá os ár gcomhair. Faoi alt 28 den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979, déanfar toghchán a dhéanamh i gceann tréimhsí nach giorra ná ceithre bliana agus nach faide ná cúig bliana. Ciallaionn sé sin &ndash; faoin reachtaíocht atá i bhfeidhm &ndash; gurb é an 8 Meitheamh 1999 an dáta is déanaí don chéad toghchán eile. Bhí sé mar aidhm agam go mbeadh an reachtaíocht leasaithe a dhéanfadh athstruchtúradh ar an Údarás rite in am chun toghchán an Údarás a chur ar siúl faoi réir na socruithe nua toghchánaíochta in Aibreán/Bealtaine na bliana seo nó fiú ar an lá céanna leis na toghcháin Eorpacha agus áitiúla. Mar atá mínithe agam, níl sé sin indéanta anois. Bheadh gá le reachtaíocht leasaithe cibé scéal é chun an toghchán don Údarás a chur ar siúl ar an lá céanna leis na toghcháin <Col N="1111" /> Eorpacha agus áitiúla toisc go mbeadh tréimhse níos faide ná cúig bliana i gceist ó dháta an toghcháin ba dhéanaí, is é sin, an toghchán a bhí ann ar 9 Meitheamh 1994. Is léir mar sin nach féidir cloí leis an dáta 8 Meitheamh nó fiú leis an dáta 11 Meitheamh más toghchán faoin struchtúr nua atá le bheith ann. Tá moltaí an Rialtais maidir le hathstruchtúradh a dhéanamh ar an Údarás fógraithe go poiblí agus tá pobal na Gaeltachta ag tnúth leis na socruithe nua. Ní bheadh sé ceart ná ciallmhar mar sin an toghchán a reachtáil faoin seanstruchtúr toghchánaíochta. Measaim go n-aontódh gach duine anseo leis an deareadh sin. Feictear domsa go gcaithfear a bheith praiticiúil faoi dháta an toghcháin agus sna cúinsí go léir measaim go n-aontóidh an Teach gur socrú réalaíoch é an toghchán a chur siar.</P>
    <P>Maidir le toghchán an Údaráis a reachtáil ar dháta ar leith ó na toghcháin Eorpacha agus áitiúla, tá sé ráite gur cur amú airgead an cháiníocóra é sin. Ní aontaím leis an dearcadh sin. Faoi mar is eol don Teach ritheadh toghchán 1979 agus 1984 an Údarás leo féin. Is ó 1989 ar aghaidh a ritheadh an toghchán ar an lá céanna le toghcháin eile. Glacaim leis go mbíonn costais bhreise i gceist má bhíonn toghchán an Údaráis ar siúl ar dhátaí ar leith ó thoghcháin eile ach ní suim shubstaintiúil bhreise a bheidh i gceist. Táimse féin den tuairim gur maith an rud é toghchán an Údaráis a bheith ar siúl ar dháta ar leith ó thoghcháin eile chun deis a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeltachta agus na meáin díospóireacht cheart a bheith acu maidir leis na ceisteanna thábhachtacha a bhaineann leis an Údarás, leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge. Ar an taobh eile den scéal, d'ainneoin toghchán na bliana seo den Údarás a chur siar, ní bheidh cosc ann amach anseo an toghchán sin a chur ar siúl ar an dáta ceanna leis na toghcháin Eorpacha nó na toghcháin áitiúla nó fiú olltoghchán fad is atá an dáta dó laistigh den tréimhse in alt 28 den reachtaíocht. Leis an leasú atá á mholadh sa Bhille, beidh níos mó solúbthachta ann feasta chun an toghchán don Údarás agus toghcháin eile a reachtáil ar an dáta céanna toisc go bhfuil an tréimhse incheadaithe is faide i gcás thoghchán an Údaráis á méadú.</P>
    <P>Leis an mBille gairid seo ina Acht agus leis an mBille cuimsitheach a fhoilseofar go luath rite roimh shos an tsamhraidh bheadh na socruithe toghchánaíochta nua atá luaite agam i bhfeidhm in am chun an toghchán don Údarás a chur ar siúl san fhómhar. Ní féidir liom a rá ag an bpointe séo cathain go díreach san fhómhar a bheidh an toghchán sin ar siúl. Déanfar an dáta a fhógairt i dtráth chuí. Beidh gá le leasú a dhéanamh sna Rialacháin a bhaineann le toghchán an Údaráis chun iad a thabhairt suas chun dáta agus tá an obair sin idir lámha freisin.</P>
    <P>Mar achoimre tá reachtaíocht chuimsitheach á dréachtú maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta go háirithe i dtaca le hathstruchtúradh an bhoird de agus tá ciall leis an bhforáil sa Bhille gairid seo chun síneadh ama de sé mhí a chur leis an tréimhse is faide idir toghcháin don Údarás le go <Col N="1112" /> bhféadfar an chéad toghchán eile don Údarás a chur ar siúl faoi na socruithe nua a shonrófar sa Bhille cuimsitheach atá á dhréachtú. Tá ar intinn agam, mar atá ráite agam níos túisce san óráid seo, an chéad toghchán eile don Údarás a chur ar siúl san fhómhar. Dár ndóigh, is é an dáta is deireanaí faoin mBille seo go bhféadfaí é a chur ar siúl ná 9 Nollaig seo chugainn. Molaim an Bille don Teach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta McGinley.</P>
      <P>Níl mo pháirtí i gcoinne an Bhille seo ach tá cúpla ceist agam don Aire Stáit. Ós rud é go bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí suite in áiteanna iarghúlta, cé fáth gur roghnaigh sé an fómhar do na toghcháin? Cén fáth nár chuir sé ar ais iad ar feadh bliana, go dtí an samhradh seo chugainn? Cén fáth go bhfuil sé ag iarraidh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta dul amach sa gheimhreadh chun toghchán a reachtáil? Níl fonn ar éinne dul ag canbhasáil nuair atá an aimsir go dona.</P>
      <P>Ina óráid, dúirt an tAire Stáit go raibh a lán airgid curtha isteach sa Ghaeltacht ag an Rialtas ach má fhéachann sé ar an tuarascáil, Treo 2000, a choimisiúnaigh an t-iarAire Gaeltachta, luadh go raibh timpeall £76 milliún curtha isteach ag Rialtas na Breataine i dteanga na Breataine Bige. Níl líon an airgid atá caite ag an Rialtas anseo sa Ghaeltacht ag cur beocht le labhairt na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Sin í an fhadhb atá ann. Níl muintir na Gaeltachta sásta an Ghaeilge a labhairt mar ghnáth-theanga. Ní bhaineann furmhór na ndaoine óga sa Ghaeltacht úsáid as an nGaeilge. Bhí duine ar an teilifís aréir a dúirt nach raibh dul chun cinn á dhéanamh. Bhí imní air go mbeidh an teanga caillte sul i bhfad.</P>
      <P>Tá pleananna móra ag an Aire Stáit don Údarás agus pléfimid iad sin nuair a fhoilseofar iad ach maidir leis na baill a bheidh ar an mBord nua níor chuir sé na hoileáin san áireamh agus níl sé i gceist aige ball de Chomhdháil na nOileán a chur ar an mBord ainneoin go bhfuil an eagraíocht sin ann le sé nó seacht mbliana agus dul chun cinn déanta acu ar son mhuintir na n-oileán.</P>

      <P>Aontaím leis an mBille chomh fada agus a théann sé ach ní théann sé fada go leor. Aontaím leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire Stáit gur cheart go mbeadh toghchán Údarás na Gaeltachta ar lá dó féin gan é a bheith ar siúl an lá céanna le toghchán na hEorpa agus na tochgháin áitiúla. Mar tá dearmad ar fad déanta den Ghaeltacht agus d'Údarás na Gaeltachta. Is é an buntáiste é a chur ar siúl ar lá dó féin ná go mbeidh deis againn sa bhfeachtas a bheidh ag dul ar aghaidh ar feadh cúpla seachtain roimh an toghchán plé a dhéanamh ar an Údarás, ar an Ghaeltacht, ar an teanga, ar an tionsclaíocht agus ar gach rud a bhaineann leis an Ghaeltacht</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ar bun anois le fiche bliain  &ndash; 1979 chomh fada agus is cuimhin liom &ndash; agus d'fhéadfá a rá i mbéaloideas na Gaeltachta go bhfuil sé &ldquo;Fiche Bliain ag Fás&rdquo;. Sílim go bhfuil obair íontach déanta ag an Údarás <Col N="1113" /> chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis na Gaeltachtaí agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil le linn an ama sin. Tá na mílte ag obair ar fud na Gaeltachta anois i dtionscail agus in imeachtaí eile a bhfuil airgead nó tacaíocht de shaghas éigin tugtha ag an Údarás dóibh. Sílim go bhfuil breis agus 2,000 ar a laghad ag obair i dtionscail i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall a fuair cuidiú ón Údarás. Is dóigh liom gurb í an eastát tionscalaíochta is tábhachtaí agus is mó le rá in aon cheantar Gaeltachta ná an ceann atá i mo pharóiste féin i nGaoth Dobhair a bhfuil idir míle agus míle go leith duine ag obair ann. Muna mbeadh sé ann cad a bheadh ag dul ar aghaidh sa cheantar Gaeltachta sin? Cá mbeadh an t-anam nó an spiorad sa cheantar mura mbeadh an t-eastát tionscalaíochta sin ann?</P>
    <P>Ach sílim i ndiaidh 20 bliain go bhfuil sé tráthúil amharc níos doimhne ar ról, ar éifeacht, ar fheidhmiú agus ar chumhachtaí an Údaráis. Tá athstructúradh á dhéanamh ach is é an t-aon rud atá ag tárlú ná go bhfuil breis á chur le ballraíocht Bhord an Údaráis. Tá sé á mhéadú ó 13 bhall go 16 bhall agus triúr eile á ainmniú  &ndash; an Cathaoirleach, duine ón Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán agus duine ón Roinn Airgeadais.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil níos mó daonlathais á chur i bhfeidhm agus go mbeidh seans ag na Gaeltachtaí beaga nach raibh éinne ar an mBord acu go dtí seo duine a thoghadh. Ach is mór an trua nár chuamar níos faide agus scrúdú a dhéanamh ar na cumhachtaí atá ag an mBord. An bhféadfaí níos mó cumhachtaí a thabhairt dóibh? Is iad na cumhachtaí atá acu faoi láthair ná bunú tionscal agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do thionscail sa Ghaeltacht agus don teanga agus don cultúr. An bhfuil go leor béime á chur ar an teanga agus ar an chultúr? An mbeadh sé níos éifeachtaí ó thaobh forbairt na Gaeltachta de go mbeadh cumhachtaí ag an Údarás maidir le infrastructúir? Tá go leor de na monarchana agus de na tionscail i gceantair iarghúlta sa Ghaeltacht agus an bhfuil na bóithre agus cúrsaí cumarsáide ag cur leis an bhforbairt tionsclaíochta? An bhféadfadh sé a bheith níos fearr? Sílim go dtuigeann an tAire Stáit féin go bhféadfadh sé a bheith níos fearr mar dúirt sé go minic gurb é an cuspóir atá aige ná go mbeadh mór-bhóthar ceart ag dul isteach go dtí gach príomh Ghaeltacht sa tír.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir forbairt cheart a dhéanamh ar an eastát i nGaoth Dobhair mar tá an bóthar isteach ann go dona. Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil an scéal céanna i nGhaeltacht an Aire Stáit féin i gConamara agus i nGaeltacht Mhaigheo, Chiarraí agus Chorcaí chomh maith. B'fhiú ar a laghad ról comhairleach a thabhairt don Údarás ar an fhadhb seo agus go mbeadh siad in ann a gcuid moltaí a chur ar aghaidh go dtí an Roinn Chomhshaoil nó go dtí an Comhairle Chontae agus go dtabharfaí aird orthu.</P>
    <P>Is mór an trua é nach bhfuil athrú mar sin sa Bhille seo. Tuigim gur Bille teoranta atá ann agus gurb é an príoimhthéarma sa Bhille ná téarma an Bhoird seo a chur siar sé mhí eile. Ach idir seo agus an t-am a mbeidh an Bille ag teacht isteach b'fhiú don Roinn moltaí a lorg ó na Gaeltachtaí <Col N="1114" /> féin faoin dóigh a bhféadfaí feabhas a chur ar an obair mhaith atá á dhéanamh ag an Údarás ó bunaíodh é 20 bliain ó shin. Aontaím cinnte gur chóir go mbeadh tuilleadh ballraíochta ar Bhord an Údaráis, ceathrar ó Dhún na nGall, cúigear ó Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe, beirt ó Mhaigheo, beirt ó Chiarraí agus duine ó Chorcaigh, duine ó Phortláirge agus duine ó Chontae na Mí.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud é go mbeidh guth ag na Gaeltachtaí sin go léir ar an mBord. Maidir le Gaeltacht Dhún na nGall de tá 26,000 duine ina gcomhnaí ansin agus is mór an trua é nár thóg an tAire Stáit céim amháin eile ar aghaidh agus cúigear a thabhairt dúinne fosta. Chinnteodh sin go mbeadh ionadaíocht, ní amháin sna Gaeltachtaí móra &ndash; Gaoth Dobhair, Cloch an Fhaola agus Na Rossa &ndash; ach fosta ag áiteacha in iardheisceart an chondae &ndash; Gleann Cholmcille, Cill Chártha agus Carraig &ndash; agus an Gaeltacht lír &ndash; Fanaid, Ros Goill, na Dúnaibh agus an Tearmann. Is ceantair bheaga Ghaeltachta iad sin agus dá mbeadh duine breise ann is cinnte go mbeadh seans níos mó ionadaíocht a bheith acu istigh ar bhord an Údaráis chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh ionadaíocht ag na ceantair bheaga Ghaeltachta ar bhord an Údaráis mar go minic déantar socruithe a chuireann isteach go mór ar phobal áitiúil. Níl ann ach tamall ó bhí mé ag caint leis an Aire Stáit fá sampla an-mhaith de sin i nGaeltacht iardheisceart an chondae &ndash; an áit ar thóg Údarás na Gaeltachta air féin sé bhliain ó shin iascaireacht Theilinn a thabhairt do dhream áirithe. Níor dearnadh teangbháil cheart le muintir na háite agus ón lá sin go dtí an lá inniu d'fhéadfá a rá go bhfuil cogadh cathartha ar siúl sa pháirt sin de Ghaeltacht Thír Chonaill, áit a raibh pobal ceansa, macánta, mín, soineanta a chomhoibrigh le chéile lá agus oíche, bliain i ndiaidh bliana. B'fhéidir go mbeadh difríochtaí eatarthu anois agus arís ar pháirc na peile nuair a bhuail Gleann Cholmcille agus Cill Chártha ag imirt le chéile ach ina dhiaidh sin bhí siad aontaithe. D'éirigh leis an Údarás, agus ba é an t-Údarás a rinne é agus cuirim an locht go hiomlán air, an pobal sin a scoilt ó bhun go barr. Tá an cogadh cathartha ag dul ar aghaidh ansin go fóill agus is beag dul chun cinn atá déanta ag an Údarás chun sin a leigheas. Cuireann sé isteach go mór orm pobal Gaeltachta mar sin a fheiceáil scoilte de bharr cinnidh a rinne Údarás na Gaeltachta mar nach ndeachaigh sé i gcomhairle leis an phobal áitiúil. Tá súil agam go ndéanfar socrú ceart chun an pobal sin a athaontú agus go ndéanfar forbairt ar an iascaireacht ansin ar mhaithe leis an phobal uilig. Tá an dualgas ar an Údarás agus an Roinn sin a dhéanamh. Bhí teangbháil eatarthu agus an Aire Stáit agus tuigeann sé go maith caidé mar atá cúrsaí ansin. Tá idirghabhalaí sínseartha ceaptha le breis agus sé mhí agus beidh muid uilig ag súíl go n-éireoidh leis seo a shocrú.</P>
    <P>Ní tharlódh a leithéid de rud dá mbeadh ionadaí ag ceantar Gaeltachta mar sin ar an bhord mar bheadh sé ábalta a chur in iúl don Údarás agus do <Col N="1115" /> na feidhmeannaigh go mbeadh deacrachtaí ann dá rachfaí ar aghaidh le plean mar sin.</P>
    <P>Tá cás á dhéanamh san iarthar go mbeadh ionadaí ag na hoileáin ar bhord an Údaráis. Tá trí oileáin ar chósta Thír Chonaill agus ar Thoraí agus ar Ghabhla tá 700 duine lonnaithe ar an bheirt acu. D'fhéadfaí cás a dhéanamh go mbeadh ionadaíocht acu ar an bhord agus dá dtabharfaí duine breise dúinn is cinnte go mbeadh sé ar mhaithe go mór go mbeadh duine ar an bhord acu.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí cumhachtaí eile a thabhairt don Údarás. Tá cumhachtaí teoranta aige i lathair na huaire chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le forbairt na turasóireachta. Tá féideareachtaí móra ag an tionscal sin sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá na Gaeltachtaí lonnaithe i bpáirt den tír a mbíonn ag tarraingt an pobal naisiúnta agus idirnaisiúnta isteach inti agus anois bíonn béim níos mó ar an turasóireacht chúltúrtha. Níl dream níos fearr leis sin a dhéanamh ná Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá an tÁire Stáit ag tabhairt cumhachtaí teoranta dó; b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí cumhachtaí níos leithne a thabairt dó sa dóigh is go dtiocfadh leis forbairt cheart a dhéanamh ar an ghné sin den tionsclaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>B'fhiú amharc ar sheirbhisí. Tuigtear go forleathan anois go bhfuil féidearachtaí móra i seirbhísí le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil. Cuireann an t-Údarás, cosúil leis na háisíochtaí &ndash; an IDA, SFADCo agus iad siúd &ndash; béim ar phostanna tionsclaíochta. Má amharcann duine ar caidé tá ag tarlú i dtíortha eile ar fud na hEorpa agus sna Stáit Aontaithe, chífidh sé go gcuirtear a lán postanna ar fáil i seirbhísí. Tá na Gaeltachtaí easnamhach go fóill chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le roinnt seirbhísí.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go bhfuil deacrachtaí ansin. Má thugtar deontas do sheirbhís éigin i gceantar agus seirbhís dá leithéid ann chéanna féin, tugtar an deontas sin do dhuine amháin chun duine eile a chur amach as gnó. Ní hé sin an rud atá i gceist agam. Áit go féidir leis an Údarás a aimsiú go bhfuil easnamh seirbhísí i gceantar Gaeltachta, d'fhéadfadh leis theacht isteach agus cuidiú a thabhairt do dhuine éigin as an áit, a saolaíodh agus a tógadh san áit agus é ina chainteoir dhúcháis Ghaeilge, fá choinne na seirbhíse riachtanacha sin a chur a fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá na ceantair Ghaeltachta íargúlta agus is beag freastail a rinne CIÉ nó Bus Éireann ar na Gaeltachtaí. Ní thig siad ar dhóigh. Níl baint ag Bus Éireann le Na Rossa, Gaoth Dobhair, Cloch an Fhaola, Fanaid ná páirt ar bith eile den Ghaeltacht taobh amuigh de Ghleann Cholmcille. Tháinig daoine áitiúla chun tosaigh. Chuir siad busanna ar fáil agus tá seirbhísí den scoth ar fáil ó Ghaeltacht Thír Chonaill gach lá sa tseachtain go Baile Átha Cliath, Gaillimh agus Béal Feirste. Ag taisteal ó thuaidh ag an deireadh seachtaine, chífear bus i ndiaidh bus ag dul síos go Gaillimh, Baile Átha Cliath agus Béal Feirste agus na hainmneacha anuas i nGaeilge. Sin daoine ag cur fostaíochta agus seirbhísí ar fáil agus ní bhfuair <Col N="1116" /> siad oiread agus pingin rua chun sin a dhéanamh. Sin an cineál seirbhísí atá i gceist agam. D'fhéadfadh leis an Údarás ról a bheith aige seirbhísí den chineál sin a aimsiú agus cuidiú a thabhairt díofa.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Céire, is Bille gairid seo atá an-teoranta a thig an toghchán a chur siar sé mhí. Beidh deis againn idir seo agus deireadh na bliana plé a dhéanamh ar an Bhille chuimsitheach a chuirfidh an t-Aire Stáit os ár gcomhar. Nuair a bhí an Aire Stáit ina úrlabhraí ar an taobh seo den Teach, bhí sé i gcónai iontach deimhneach chomh fada agus a bhain sé leis an Údarás. Thuig sé ról tábhachtach an Údaráis sna Gaeltachtaí agus an gá a bhí le breis feidhmeannais agus breis cumhachtaí a thabhairt. Tá sé san áit anois gur féidir leis sin a dhéanamh. Tá tuigbheáil aige ar an Ghaeltacht agus na deachrachtaí istigh ann agus tuigbheáil aige ar ról an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>I ndiaidh 20 bliain, tá an-obair déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta do na Gaeltachtaí. Dá mbá rud é nach raibh sé ann agus ag gníomhú mar atá, ní bheadh an Ghaeltacht leath chomh láidir ó thaobh eacnamaíochta agus fostaíochta agus atá sí inniu. Caithfidh an Údarás dul in iomaíocht leis an IDA agus SFADCo.</P>
    <P>Tá an cumas agus an dearcadh ceart ag na feidhmeannaigh a bhfuil suim phearsanta agus aithne phearsanta ar achan páirt den Ghaeltachta. Tá &ldquo;hands on approach&rdquo; acu agus iad acu le moladh. Chímid go léir ag cruinnithe poiblí ar fud an Dáilcheantair an tAire Stáit, ionadaí an Teachta Uí Mhuineacháin agus daoine eile as an Gaeltacht. Bíonn feidhmeannaigh an Údaráis ag na cruinnithe sin go luath agus go mall. Cuireann siad saothar mór isteach san obair atá a dhéanamh acu. Is as an Ghaeltacht an chuid is mó acu agus iad nach as, tá Ghaeilge den chéad scoth acu agus tá dearcadh deimhneach, cinnte acu. Tá siad bródúíl as an obair a dhéanann siad agus tá suim acu inti. Ba mhaith liom go n-aithneofaí sin agus sinn ag caint ar an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Tá muid ag tabhairt tacaíochta don Bhille teoranta seo agus beidh Bille eile níos cuimsithe ag teacht romhainn idir seo agus deireadh na bliana. B'fhéidir go ndéanfadh an tAire Stáit machnamh agus scrúdú ceart ar ról an Údaráis sna fiche bliain amach romhainn. Tá mé cinnte gur mhaith leis an Aire Stáit gur fiche bliain fé bhláth a bheadh iontu, chomh mór agus a ba mhaith liom féin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm an deis a fháil labhairt ar an mBille seo. Bille gairid is ea é  &ndash; níl mórán ann ach cead don Aire an toghchán d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur siar ar feadh sé mhí, más mian leis agus ina theannta sin, an gearrtheideal, an chomh luath agus an forléiriú.</P>
      <P>Ní bheidh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille seo ós rud é nach bhfuil an reachtaíocht chuimsitheach ullamh go fóill. Ag tagairt don reachtaíocht sin, mar a dúirt an tAire linn roimhe sin, níor thoiligh an Rialtas áit a thabhairt don cheardchumann ASF ar an údarás nua. Bhí mé ag caint ar seo sa Dáil le déanaí agus d'iarr mé ar an Aire féachaint ar an gceist seo arís agus dúirt sé go bhféachfadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach ar Údarás mar seo go mbeadh duine éigin ann ag freastal ar ghnó an Údaráis agus ag féachaint ar an ngnó sin ó dhealramh na ndaoine atá ag obair san Údarás. Chuala mé, cé nach bhfuilim lánchinnte faoi seo, go bhfuil an ceardchumann ag iarraidh bualadh leis an Aire chun an reachtaíocht chuimsitheach a phlé. Iarraim ar an Aire inniu bualadh leis an gcearchumann chuige sin.</P>
    <P>Rud eile atá ag déanamh buartha don Lucht Oibre ná go raibh trí leasú curtha síos againn maidir le trí ghné den Bhille. Fuair mé scéala ón gCeann Comhairle inniu nach bhfuil dhá cheann de na leasuithe in ord.</P>
    <P>Glacaimid leis go mba chóir an toghchán d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a reachtáil ar lá leis féin  &ndash; agus ní leis na toghcháin Eorpacha nó áitiúla  &ndash; mar más rud nach mbíonn aon toghchán eile ar siúl, is iad na daoine a bhfuil suim acu san Údarás agus sa Ghaeltacht a thiocfaidh amach le vóta a chaitheamh. Nuair atá toghcháin eile ar siúl freisin, is féidir go mbíonn vótaí á chaitheamh ag daoine nach bhfuil suim dá laghad acu i saol na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil ceist airgid i gceist anseo agus is dóigh liom gur fiú an t-airgead a chaitheamh ar thoghchán don Údarás ar lá leis féin  &ndash; i ndeireadh na dála beidh na Gaeltachtaí i bhfad níos fearr as.</P>
    <P>An triú leasú a bhí againn  &ndash; agus b'fhéidir go bhféachfadh an tAire air don reachtaíocht chuimsitheach  &ndash; ná go bhfuil rialacháin ann anois don toghchán don Údarás ach is fearr go mbeadh na rialacha céanna i bhfeidhm don toghchán seo agus atá i bhfeidhm do na toghcháin Dála.</P>
    <P>Tá na rialacháin a bhaineann le toghcháin Dála scríofa síos i reachtaíocht ach tá rialacháin an Údaráis ann ó 1994. Tagann feabhas ar rialacháin d'olltoghcháin de réir a chéile agus má dhéanann an tAire leasú sa reachtaíocht ar Bhille 1979 beidh na rialacháin chéanna ag baint leis an toghchán don Údarás agus a bhaineann leis an Dáil. Ba mhaith go mbeadh na rialacháin scríofa síos san Electoral Act agus go mbeadh siad mar an gcéanna sa dá thoghchán.</P>
    <P>Tá athrú á thabhairt isteach leis an mBille seo ach ní dóigh go mba chóir don athrú seasamh níos mó ná bliain. Tá sé níos fearr go mbíonn toghchán ann sa samhradh chun seans a thabhairt do sheandaoine, ach go háirithe, a gcuid vótaí a chaitheamh. De réir an leasaithe i m'ainmse, ghlacfaí leis an t-athrú go dtí tosach na bliana 2000, agus go bhfillfimid ar an seanstaid ina dhiaidh sin  &ndash; go mbeadh sé de chead ag an Aire Gaeltachta toghcháin Ghaeltachta a chur in áit idir ceithre bliana agus cúig bliana ón toghchán deiridh.</P>
    <P>Is mar seo a bheadh. An chéad toghchán tar éis toghchán na bliana seo, d'fhéadfadh an tAire é a chur ar siúl ar lá i rith an tsamhraidh ach ní ar an lá céanna leis na toghcháin áitiúla nó Eorpacha. As sin amach bheadh sé ann tar éis gach cúig bliana.</P>
    <P>Táim sásta leis an eolas atá fachta agam faoin reachtaíocht chuimsitheach. Glacaim agus fáiltím roimh an méadú ar líon na gcomhaltaí tofa ar an <Col N="1118" /> Údarás agus go mbeidh comhaltaí ann ó na contaetha ina bhfuil Gaeltachtaí beaga. De réir dealraimh, oirfidh sé domsa, ag teacht ó Chontae Phort Láirge agus an Rinn ann freisin. Beidh toghcheantar i ngach contae ina bhfuil Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Maidir le MSF, tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh seans ag an gceardchumann comhalta a chur ar an Údarás seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le teorainn na Gaeltachta, admhaíonn an tAire go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann ach tuigim go bhfuil sé ag tabhairt faoin gceist. Áit a bhfuil amhras faoin méid Gaeilge atá á labhairt, beidh caighdeán teangan á thabhairt isteach ag an Aire, agus beidh ar an gceantar sin an caighdeán sin a shroichint. Áit a theipeann ar cheantar, tabharfar a dhóthain ama don gceantar an caighdeán a shroichint agus tá sé seo tuisceanach.</P>
    <P>Do dhaoine nach bhfuil ag úsáid na Gaeilge chomh minic agus a d'fhéadfaidís, tá sé tábhachtach go dtuigfeadh siad an scéal mar gheall ar na teorainneacha agus go mbeadh seans acu an scéal a fheabhsú ionas gur féidir leo fanacht sa Ghaeltacht. Ní theastaíonn ó éinne go mbeadh an teorainn ag cúngú isteach ach caithfidh na teorainneacha bheith fírinneach.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh ag an Aire machnamh a dhéanamh ar na leasuithe a chuir mé síos agus an reachtaíocht chuimsitheach á dhréachtú aige.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid díospóireacht fhorleathan a chur ar siúl faoin dtír mar gheall ar an nGaeltacht agus ar an nGaeilge. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil suim dhomhain ag an-chuid daoine sa teanga. Caithfimid dul ar ais agus a thaispeáint do dhaoine cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an cultúr agus an Ghaeilge. Ní mór a bheith cinnte nach bhfuilimid ag iarraidh ar dhaoine fanúint sna Gaeltachtaí agus gan caighdeán maireachtála ceart acu, atá gach pioc chomh maith daoine eile faoin dtír.</P>
    <P>Ní mór súil a choimeád i gcónaí ar chaighdeán maireachtála na Gaeltachta agus goilleann sé orm a chlos go bhfuil sé thar a bheith deacair anois do dhaoine óga sa Ghaeltacht píosa talún a cheannach le teach a thógáil air. Tá daoine ag teacht isteach ón iasacht agus tá siad ag tógáil tithe, agus ag ceannach tithe nach mbíonn in úsáid ach amháín i rith an tsamhraidh.</P>
    <P>Sa Ghaeltacht, an rud is tábhachtaí na pobal beo agus teanga beo. Níl go leor díospóireachta ar siúl sa tír faoin nGaeilge. De réir na scrúduithe scoile, tá caighdeán na Gaeilge ag dul i léíg. Bíonn daltaí sa tír seo ag foghlaim na Gaeilge sa bhunscoil agus sa mheánscoil freisin. Tosaíonn siad ar theanga Eorpach sa mheánscoil freisin agus ni fada go mbíonn siad níos líofa inti ná mar atá siad sa Ghaeilge. Goilleann sé sin orm. Tá cuid den phobal i gcoinne na Gaeilge agus tá jab againne mar pholaiteoirí daoine a mhealladh chun an scéal a scrúdú agus chun machnamh a dhéanamh ar chás na Gaeilge. Is uaidh sin a thagann an tuiscint.</P>
    <P>Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ag déanamh jab maith ach má theastaíonn uainn go mbeadh an dátheangachas i réim sa tír seo, caithfidh an pobal breathnú ar an teanga mar chuid dá saibhreas. Go dtí go dtagann an lá seo agus go mbíonn an meon <Col N="1119" /> sin forleathan, leanfaidh an meath a fheicimid i gcúrsaí Gaeilge agus beidh rudaí ag dul in olcas.</P>
    <P>Ní bheidh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre ag seasamh in aghaidh an Bhille seo. Tá súil agam go mbeidh am agam an t-aon leasú atá fágtha agam a phlé sa díospóireacht agus iarraim ar an Aire breathnú ar an dá cheann eile agus iad féin nó leasuithe atá cóngarach dóibh a chur isteach sa reachtaíocht chuimsitheach.</P>

      <P>In ainneoin gur ón nGalltacht dom agus go n-aithním go maith an fhorbairt atá ar siúl ó thaobh na teanga de sna cathracha agus sna fobhailte, go háirithe anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath, tá todhchaí na Gaeilge ag brath ar an nGaeltacht agus ar dhaoine a choimeád ag obair ann.</P>
      <P>Aithním go bhfuil gá leis an mBille seo agus is trua go bhfuil moill ar an reachtaíocht chuimsitheach ach tuigimid go bhfuil práinn mhór ag baint leis na hullmhúcháin don fhoras teanga thuaidh/theas. Tá áthas ar gach duine, ar suim leo an Ghaeilge, go bhfuil sé ar cheann de na nithe atá ar an gclár oibre ag an leibhéal is airde den phróiseas Angla-Éireannach faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>Tá dúshlán ollmhór ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus tá ag éirí leis a bhformhór a shárú. Caithfear feidhm agus ról Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur i gcomhthéacs na ndúshlán agus na ndeacrachtaí atá le sárú aige.</P>
      <P>Is é aidhm agus feidhm an Údaráis, de réir mar a leagadh síos sa reachtaíocht faoinar bunaíodh é, ná leas na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh, eacnamaíocht na gceantar sin a fhorbairt, fostaíocht a chruthú agus a bhuanú agus teanga agus cultúr sainiúil na nGaeltachtaí a shlánú chun go gcosnófaí agus go ndaingneofaí an Ghaeilge mar theanga pobail i ngach Gaeltacht, idir mhór agus bheag. Seo ról an-dúshlánach agus an-leathan. Is údarás tionscail agus caomhnóir cultúir é, is eagras sochtheangeolaíoch é agus baineann gnéithe dá chúram le hoideachas, le turasóireacht, le hoiliúint, leis na healaíona agus le rialtas áitiúil. Ní féidir liomsa léirmheas ceart a dhéanamh ar an mbealach a bhfuil ag éirí leis an Údarás agus tá daoine a thagann ó na Gaeltachtaí agus a bhfuil an t-eolas sin acu. Beidh deis againn níos deireannaí sa bhliain nuair a bheidh an reachtaíocht á phlé anseo, cloisteáil uathu.</P>
      <P>Tá sé an-deacair ar an Údarás feidhmiú go héifeachtach i ngach ceann de na dualgais a liostaigh mé. Tá an saol ag athrú chomh tapa céanna sa nGaeltacht nó níos tapúla agus atá sé in áíteanna eile. Mar shampla, ina phríomhról mar údarás forbartha tionscail, tá ar an Údarás a bheith san iomaíocht le húdaráis eile sa tír seo agus ó thíortha eile san Eoraip atá ag iarraidh tionsclóirí agus lucht fiontair a mhealladh. Tá éacht déanta ag an Údarás sa ghnó seo nuair a smaoinímid gur cruthaíodh 1,295 post anuraidh  &ndash; sin méadú de cheathair faoin gcéad ar an mbliain roimhe sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tuigimid go maith go raibh an Ghaeltacht cuid <Col N="1120" /> mhaith chun deiridh ó thaobh bhonneagar ceart iompair, teileachumarsáide agus cóiríochta agus tá sé sin sáraithe acu.</P>
    <P>Tá tréithe áirithe léirithe ag an Údarás ó bunaíodh é a thugann dóchas dom don todhchaí. Bhí agus tá an t-Údarás misniúil  &ndash; bíonn sé ag deileáil le fiontraíocht agus tá sé sásta dul sa tseans leo. Is é nádúr na hoibre seo go dteipeann ar thograí uaireanta agus léiríonn an t-Údarás an iomarca misnigh b'fhéidir ach caithfear infheistiú a dhéanamh i dtograí fiúntacha.</P>
    <P>Tá léargas leathan ag an Údarás  &ndash; feictear dó go bhfuil ceangal ann idir forbairt tionsclaíoch, forbairt pobail, oideachas, oiliúint agus oidhreacht. Cuireann sé na cúinsí sin go léir san áireamh ina chuid pleanála. Leagann sé béim ar an gcomhpháirtíocht agus tá sé solúbtha.</P>
    <P>Is eol dom go bhfuil daoine áirithe ann a mheasann gur duáilce é seo agus tá sé léirithe ag an Údarás gur béas leis a chuid tosaíochtaí a leagan síos i bhfianaise na gcúinsí a fheictear dó ag aon am. Ach níl aon drogall air na tosaíochtaí sin a athrú sa chás go n-athraíonn na cúinsí. Ba é an fheirmeoireacht mara an chloch ba mhó ar phaidrín an Údaráis, tráth, agus leagadh an béim is mó ar an gcineál sin tionscail. Ach d'athraigh an bunús eacnamúil a bhí faoin tionscal sin agus d'athraigh dearcadh an Údaráis dá réir.</P>
    <P>Dea-rud é sin agus feictear dúinn i measc na poist a cruthaíodh anuraidh gur san earnáil innealtóireachta leictreonach agus seirbhísí a cruthaíodh a leath dóíbh.</P>
    <P>Tá dearcadh idirnáisiúnta ag an Údarás: tuigeann sé an diminsean Eorpach  &ndash; tá oifig aige sa Bhruiséil agus oibríonn sé go dlúth le bord dá chineál féin i limistéir eile san Eoraip a bhfuil na dúshláin chéanna á dtabhairt  &ndash; in Alban, sa Bhreatain Bheag agus sa Bhriotáin, ach go háirithe.</P>
    <P>Tá éacht déanta ag an Údarás i bhforbairt thionscal na físe le deich mbliana anuas. Nuair a bhí daoine eile ag caint faoi Theilifís na Gaeilge, bhí an t-Údarás ag obair ar a son. Oibríonn sé go dlúth anois leis na dreamanna eile san earnáil seo  &ndash; le Raidió na Gaeltachta, Teilifís na Gaeilge agus leis na móroibreoirí eile san earnáil seo atá bunaithe ar na hacmhainní nádúrtha is saibhre agus is flúirsí dá bhfuil sa Ghaeltacht  &ndash; an tsamhlaíocht, an scéalaíocht agus an Ghaeilge féin. Is cinnte go bhfuil a luach ag dul i méid ach iad a bhainistiú i gceart.</P>
    <P>Agus an tAire ag cur Údaras nua i bhfeidhm don nGaeltacht, ba mhaith go bhféachfadh sé chuige nach mbeadh sé ró-mhór agus go mbeadh sé in ann é a láimhséail i gceart. Tuigim go mbeidh toghcháin ar siúl sna ceantair éagsúla agus is maith sin agus caithfimid féachaint chuige nach mbeidh na daoine go léir ag teacht ó chúlra amháin. Ba chóir go mbeadh ionadaithe ón earnáil ghnó agus fiontraíochta phríobháidieach ar an Údarás freisin.</P>
    <P>Bord lán-tofa a bheas ann, agus fáiltím roimhe sin ar son an daonlathais. An bhfuil ról ann don Údarás i bhforbairt na gceantar sin taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul i <Col N="1121" /> neart iontu<b>&ndash;</b>ag obair le Comhluadar, Muintearas, Glór na nGael agus Gael-linn?</P>
    <P>Aithním tábhacht na teanga ar fud na tíre agus go háirithe sna Gaeltachtaí agus fáiltím roimh an mBille agus roimh an obair atá ar siúl ag an Aire ar a son.</P>

      <P>Tá mórán oibre déanta ag an Údarás ó bunaíodh é fiche bliana ó shin. An deacracht i mó a bhí ag muintir na Gaeltachta le Gaeltarra ná go raibh sé an-chrua ar dhaoine ón nGaeltacht cúnamh a fháil uathu  &ndash; bhí siad ag tabhairt aghaidh ar dhaoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht don chuid is mó chun tionscail a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht. Ach tá athrú mór tagtha ar sin anois agus tá an t-Údarás ag tabhairt an-tacaíocht do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a gcuid tionscal féin a bhunú ann. Rud maith é sin mar is féidir leo a bheith cinnte go n-éireoidh leis an tionscal mar beidh muintir na háite ag tacú leis.</P>
      <P>Tá an-obair déanta ag an Aire Stáit ó ceapadh é go háirithe ó thaobh na ndeontas do na bóithre áise. Le bliain anuas tá airgead á chur isteach aige do na bóithre contae nach mbeadh an oiread sin feabhsaithe á dhéanamh orthu ag an gcomhairle contae. Cabhair mhór é sin don áit.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh gurb é Gaeltacht Mhúscraí an t-aon Ghaeltacht a bhfuil an príomhbhóthar ag dul tríd. Beidh mé ag fiafraí den Aire a dhícheall a dhéanamh don mbóthar seo atá ar an bpríomhbhóthar is measa in Éirinn. Tá sé an-deacair domsa insint do dhaoine nuair a théimid siar thar an teorainn contae go Ciarraí go bhfuil bóithre breátha acu agus na mílte punt á chaitheamh arís i mbliana orthu ag an National Roads Authority. Bóthar de sheacht nó d'ocht troigh déag ar leithead atá i mbóthar Mhuscraí ach fós níl an t-airgead ann chun é a dheisiú. Táim ag iarraidh ar an Aire an t-airgead atá ag teastáil a chur isteach sa bhóthar seo.</P>
      <P>Sin é an rud atá ag déanamh díobhála do na Gaeltachtaí. Ní haon mhaitheas monarchana agus poist mura bhfuil na bóithre againn &ndash; tá sé ró-dheacair fáil isteach sna Gaeltachtaí. Dúirt tíonsclóir liom mí ó shin gurb é an bóthar a bheith ró-bheag an chúis nach mbunódh sé tionscal ann.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith an mhaise don Aire Coláiste Íosagáin a cheannach i mBaile Bhúirne anuraidh. Tá costas mór ar thalamh chun tithe agus monarchana a thógaint ann, agus tá an t-ádh leis an Údarás go ndearna an tAire an beart seo.</P>
      <P>Molaim go nglacfaí leis an méid a dúirt an tAire Stáít anseo inniu.</P>

        <b>:</b> Cinnte, bheadh sé amaideach toghchán a reachtáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta ar an ochtú lá Meithimh, trí lá roimh na toghcháin Eorpacha agus áitiúla. Ní chóir dóibh a bheith ann ar an lá gcéanna nó caillfear na nithe suntais ar chóir a phlé i rith an fheachtais sna meáin chumarsáide agus i measc an phobail. Tá lá faoi leith ag teastáil don toghchán sin chun plé a dhéanamh ar na nithe atá ag cur isteach ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ar dhaoine ar fud na tíre ar spéis leo an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <Col N="1122" /> Tá fadhb agam leis an nós seo ag an Rialtas Billí beaga suaracha a thabhairt isteach sa Dáil chun dáta a athrú, nó mar a tharla arú inné, Bille de chúpla alt chun staid an rialtais áitiúil a chur isteach sa Bhunreacht agus nach bhféadfadh níos mó ná cúig bliana a bheith idir thoghcháin áitiúla.</P>
    <P>An rud céanna atá againn anseo. Dúirt an tAire Stáit go bhfuil Bille cuimsitheach le teacht ach ní dúirt sé cathain a thiocfaidh an Bille sin os comhair na Dála. Dúirt sé go gcaithfidh toghchán a bheith ann d'Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana. Muna dtagann an Bille sin os comhair na Dála roimh an tsamhraidh, ní fheicfear é go dtí mí Dheireadh Fómhair agus bheadh an díospóireacht agus an toghchán ag teacht ar mhullach a chéile. Níl sé sin ceart ná cóir. Mar sin caithfidh an t-Aire agus an Roinn a rá go soiléir cathain a chuirfear an Bille ar fáil agus cathain a phléifear é i dtreo is go mbeidh am ceart don díospóireacht agus don feachtas toghchánaíochta.

Níl dóthain ama againn ar maidin ach is féidir liom a rá nuair a thiocfaidh an Bille cuimsitheach ar aghaidh go mbeidh dóthain ama len é a phlé agus beidh sé á phlé sa Choiste freisin agus glacaim leis go mbeidh leasuithe á moladh.</P>
      <P>Bille beag a bhí ann inniu le deis a thabhairt dúinn an Bille cuimsitheach a thabhairt isteach agus na toghcháin a reachtáil sa bhfómhar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thóg an Teachta Carey agus Teachtaí eile ceist mar gheall ar dháta an toghcháin. Ar nós go leor eile, tá seanfhocal a deireann &ldquo;Marbh ag é agus marbh gan é&rdquo;. An fáth gur roghnaíodh sé mhí ná go mbeidh daoine á rá dá gcuirfí siar ar feadh bliana iad, nach raibh ann ach leithscéal ag an Aire mar go raibh faitíos air roimh an toghcháin. <Col N="1123" /> Mar sin roghnaíodh an t-am ba ghiorra a d'fhágfadh solúbthacht fadtéarmach agus a chinnteodh nach gcuirfí ceist an toghcháin seo ar an méar fhada.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé sa Teach i dTráth na gCeist le gairidard go bhfuil súil agam go mbeidh an Bille nua foilsithe sa téarma seo agus é rite tríd an Oireachtas sa gcaoi is gur féidir na toghcháin a reachtáil sa bhfómhar. Is é mo rogha féin go mbeadh sé ar siúl réasúnta luath san fhómhar agus mar sin is é an sprioc soiléír atá leagtha amach againn ná an Bille a bheith faoi bhráid an Tí i rith théarma seo na Dála, é a bheith rite, agus na toghcháin seo a bheith ann sa bhfómhar agus an dáta deiridh reachtúil a bheas ann ná an 18 Nollaig.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím leis na Teachtaí a dúirt gur fearr toghchán a bheith ann sa samhradh. Mar dhuine atá ina chónaí in áit iarghúlta, tá an ghráin dhearg agam ar thoghcháin sa samhradh de bhrí go bhfuil sé an-deacair do mhuintir na háite dul i mbun obair toghchánaíochta nuair atá cúrsaí feirmmeoireachta, Gaeilgeoirí agus cúrsaí eile nach iad ag cur as dóibh. Throid mise toghchán amháin i mí na Samhna agus ceann eile i mí Eanáir i 1987 agus bhí an-fonn oibre ar an bpobal sa gheimhreadh. Bheadh súil agam leis an gcomhréiteach gur sa bhfómhar a bheidh sé agus go luath ann. Beidh dóthain faid sna tráthnónta fós.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an oiread sin aontaithe timpeall an Tí inniu go mbeadh toghchán an Udaráis ar lá faoi leith. Caithfidh mé a rá go mbíonn an-fhonn chun oibre agus díograis ar an bpobal ach 'sé an comhréiteach a bheadh súil agam leis i gcás áirithe ná gur sa bhfómhar a bheadh sé ach nach an-deireanach sa bhfómhar. Ag an am céanna nuair a smaoiníonn tú faoi na Gaeltachtaí nach i lár an tsamhraidh go minic a bhíonn sár energy ag go leor de na pobail Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis na Teachtaí agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil an oiread aontaithe ar an gceist seo timpeall an Tí inniu. Sé mo rogha féin go mbeadh toghchán an Údaráis ar lá faoi leith. Glacaim leis seo agus sílim féin go mbáfaí é dá mbeadh sé i lár toghcháin, go mór-mhór na dtoghchán áitiúla. Mar sin creidim gur rud maith é go mbeidh sé ar a lá féin. Tá TnaG agus RnaG ann agus creidim, faoi mar atá ráite ag cuid de na Teachtaí, go gcuirfidh sé deis ar fáil dúinn díospóireacht fíor leathan a bheith ann ar cheist na Gaeilge agus ar cheist na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Carey tagairt do dhaoine óga agus tuigimse go maith an fhadhb atá sé ag déanamh tagart dó . An cheist ná céard a dhéanfaimid faoi? Tá céim bheag i measc go leor rudaí atá ar bun don aos óg, campaí samhraidh do lucht na Gaeltachta, atá fógraithe le coicíos agus táim ag déanamh scrúdú ar mholtaí eile. Ceann de na rudaí atá fógraithe agus curtha ar bun agam ná coiste comhairleach do dhaoine óga. D'iarr mé ar choistí pobail ar fud na Gaeltachta moltaí a chur ar aghaidh agus tá na moltaí san agam. Ní bheidh páirt nó láimh agamsa i roghnú na ndaoine go pearsanta. Táim tar éis dul ar ais i gceantair ina bhfuair mé an iomarca ainmneacha agus táim tar <Col N="1124" /> éis iarraidh ar na coistí pobail an liosta a ghearradh beagáinín. Ni mise a bheidh ag déanamh an rogha agus ní bheidh aon bheart polaitiúil leis seo. Táim ag iarraidh go labharfadh aos óg na Gaeltachta liomsa go díreach agus go ndéarfadh siad céard go díreach atá le déanamh. Creidim go bhfuil bunus leis sin.</P>
    <P>Chuir Teachtaí ceisteanna maidir le hionadaí ó na hoileáin. Níl sé éasca an cheist seo a réiteach. Dá roghnóinn duine le labhairt ar son na n-oileán, bheadh fadhb, mar shampla, le hOileán Cléire, le 165 duine le hais mhuintir Árainn, le 1,800 beagnach. Creidim i ndeireadh an lae go mbaineann na hoileáin leis na contaetha. Ar bhallraíocht méadaithe ag bhord an Údaráis, níl aon amhras orm muna dtoghtar duine ó na hoileáin, beidh tionchar nach beag acu agus tionchar méadaithe go mór acu ar thoradh an toghcháin. Mar sin, dar liomsa. déanfar freastal i bhfad níos fearr ar a mianta amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Baineann san freisin le ballraiocht Thír Chonaill. Tá míthuiscint figiúirí ann mar go minic i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe ní thugtar ach daonra an chontae. Athbhreithneoimid ar an gcoimhneas idir baill mar atá molta agus daonra na gcontaethe. Gheofar amach go bhfuil cothromas á thabhairt do Thír Chonaill. An fhadhb a bhí ann ná dá gcuirfinn ball sa bhreis do Thír Chonaill chaithfinn triúr no ceathrar eile a chur le Gaillimh, b'fheidir duine nó dhó eile do Mhaigh Eo agus bheadh san ró-mhór.</P>
    <P>Ach tá an méid seo le soiléiriú agam, leis an rud atá á mholadh agam go mbeidh, idir Baile na Finne agus an Ghaeltacht Lár agus iardheisceart an chontae, cuntar iomlán ann má scrúdaítear na figiúirí. Bheadh sé suas do mhuintir Thír Chonaill vóta da rogha duine. Ach beidh deis an-dearfach ann ionadaí a thoghadh ón cheantar sin agus duine buan a bheith ann.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil áthas ar an Teachta Ó Sé go mbeidh duine as Port Láirge ar an mBord agus creidim go bhfuil sé ag dul dóibh mar tá an Ghaeltacht sin scaipthe amach leis féin. Mar a chéile le Ráth Cairn.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cumhachtaí an Údaráis, caithfidh mé a rá, ceann de na chéad rudaí a rinne mé nuair a thosaigh mé ag beartú reachtaíocht chuimsitheach a thabhairt isteach ná breathnú ar an cheist seo. An chomhairle a cuireadh ón Údarás féin ná nach fadhb reachtúil é sin, go bhfuil an reachtaíocht sórt leathan agus gur feidir beagnach cumhacht ar bith a thabhairt don Údarás, ach toil an Rialtais a bheith ann. Mar sin, nárbh gá mórán athrú a dhéanamh sa reachtaíocht atá beartaithe. Ach é sin ráite, táim ag breathnú ar bheala le cur le stádas an Údaráis agus tá roinnt díospóireachta ar bun faoi seo. Mar shampla, bhí mé ag iarraidh socrú a dhéanamh gurb é an tÚdarás a dhéanfadh freastal sna Gaeltachtaí ar an gcineál rud a dheineann na county enterprise boards taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Creidim go luíonn sé sin le réasún sa Ghaeltacht, go mbeadh an tÚdarás ag plé le forbairt seirbhísí tionsclaíochta agus mar sin de agus gur one stop shop a bheadh ann. Táim ag plé leis an Údarás maidir le haon easnamh <Col N="1125" /> cumhachta nó feidhmeanna atá acu i láthair na huaire le go bhfeidhmeodh siad agus go mbeadh an oiread céanna réimse seirbhíse ar fáil uathu. Mar shampla, luadh tionscal na seirbhísí agus an staidéar ar na féideareachtaí le go mbeadh na feidhmeannaí ar fad ag an Údarás atá ag na CEBs i láthair na huaire. Táim ag breathnú ar an cheist sin.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis an méid atá ráite ag cúpla Teachta maidir le cúrsaí bunstruchtúir. Níl aon amhras faoi ach tá sé an-deacair ag an Údarás agus tá gaisce déanta acu ag tabhairt tionscal isteach go dtí an Ghaeltacht leis an easpa bunstruchtúir sin. Tá go leor oibre déanta agam ar an cheist sin go díreach faoi airgead a chur ar fáil tré mo Roinnse agus go hindíreach tré brú agus agus labhairt leis na dreamanna éagsúla atá ag plé le cúrsaí bunstruchtúir, le féachaint chuige go ndéanfar cothromú ó thaobh cúrsaí bunstruchtúir. Creidim féin le Sprioc a hAon bainte amach don Iarthar, go ndéanfaidh sé sin an-difríocht, mar tá go leor de na contaetha Gaeltachta faoi Sprioc 1 agus, le cúnamh Dé, cuirfidh sé sin feabhas ar chúrsaí bunstruchtúir.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cumhachtaí turasóireachta de is é an rud céanna é. Ní fadhb reachtúil é agus táim ag scrúdú na ceiste go mór mhór i gcomhthéacs an cheist Eorpach, ach níl gá le reachtaíocht i gcomhair sin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Teachta Ó Sé ball de cheardchumann a bheith mar bhall den Údarás. Mar a dúirt mé leis cheana, cloisim cad tá á rá aige agus tá sé tar eis a bheith i dteangbháil liom faoin cheist ach ba mhaith liom a dhéanamh soiléir: ní cuimhin liom ag aon am an tÚdarás ag cur iarratais chugamsa le haghaidh cruinniú le Bille cuimsitheach an Údaráis a phlé. Ó thárla go bhfuil an cheist sin curtha, déanfaidh mé fiosrú breise ar ais san oifig an bhfuil a leithéid d'iarratas ann. Má tá iarratas ann, cinnte beidh mé sásta casadh leo agus táim sásta an cheist a phlé. Mar a deirim, go bunúsach i dtaobh na ceiste sin tá cinneadh déanta ag an Rialtas faoi struchtúr an bhoird ach mar a gheall mé, feicfidh mé agus éisteoidh mé le cad tá le rá.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na rialacha don toghchán, sé an leagan amach atá ar rialacha toghchánaíochta an Údaráis ná go gcaithfidh siad a bheith faoi reir rialacha toghchánaíocta do na toghcháin áitiúla. Sin an ceangal. Ní leis na toghcháin Dála ach leis na toghcháin áitiula. Má athraítear na rialacha do na toghcháin áitiúla, de réir mar a thuigim, ansin is féidir taobh istigh de na cuinsí sin na rialacha do thoghcháin an Údaráis, ach ta ceangal ann idir na toghcháin áitiúla agus na rialacha a bhaineann leo sin agus na rialacha do thoghcháin Údarás. B'fhéidir go soiléiríonn sin an cheist. Ní raibh eolas agamsa faoi go dtí go raibh orm tabhairt faoin cheist.</P>
    <P>Maidir le teorainn na Gaeltachta, ba mhaith liom a rá gurb é atá ar bun agam ná go bhfuil eolas cruinn á chur ar fail ag an CSO agus oifig Stáit eile agus tá súil agam an t-eolas sin a bheith agam go luath. Tá roinnt den réamheolas feicthe agam agus tá sé thar a bheith spéisiúil, cruinn agus úsáideach. Tá figiúirí don tír ar fad á fháil <Col N="1126" /> agam agus figiúirí na Gaeltachta. Nuair a bheidh siad san faighte, leanfaimid ar aghaidh leis an rud atá ar bun cheana, sé sin cúrsaí pleanála teanga don Ghaeltacht. Mar chuid de sin caithfear a leagan amach cén coincheap atá againn don Ghaeltacht ó thaobh cúrsaí teanga de agus beidh an obair seo ag dul ar aghaidh. Cuirim fáilte roimh an méid a dúirt an Teachta agus faoin dearcadh dearfach atá aige i dtaobh na ceiste seo.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta tagairt do Bhillí beaga. Creidim &ndash; agus ba é mo thuairim nuair a bhí mé sa bhfreasúra agus mé i mo chúl bhínseoir &ndash; go mb'fhéidir go mbíodh an iomarca drogaill, duine a thabhairt isteach má bhí gá leis. Deirtear uaireanta nach féidir rud a dhéanamh toisc go bhfuil bac reachtúil ag baint leis cé nach bhfuil le déanamh, b'fhéidir, ach trí fhocal a athrú i mBille. Má tá gá rud a athrú, athrímís é. I gcás Bhille an Údaráis, faoi cheann dhá mhí ar a mhéid beidh deis againn dul isteach go mion i ngnó na Gaeltachta agus i ngnó an Údaráis agus beidh Bille cuimsitheach os comhair an Tí a dhéanfaidh freastail ar roinnt de na heasnaimh atá éirithe thar na blianta. Dúirt Teachta inniu go raibh fiche bliain ag fás ag an Údarás. Tá súil agam go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó ná fiche bliain faoi bhláth aige. Is cinnte go gcuideoidh an reachtaíocht nua atá le teacht, le cinntiú go mbeidh an t-Údarás faoi bhláth go ceann i bhfad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That pursuant to section 8(2) of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,1996, as amended by section 2 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Act, 1999, Dáil Éireann approves the general principles of: (a) the Telecom Éireann Employee Share Ownership Plan, to be established pursuant to section 8(3<i>(b)</i> of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996; and (b) the Initial Public Offering of Shares in Telecom Éireann, to be carried out pursuant to sections 8 and 9 of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, as amended by sections 2 and 9 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Act, 1999; copies of which principles were laid before Dáil Éireann on 21 April 1999 and on 7 May 1999 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion seeks the approval of the House for <Col N="1127" /> the general principles pertaining to two separate disposals of State owned shares in Telecom Éireann, namely, the sale and transfer of a 14.9 per cent shareholding under the employee share ownership plan and the sale of a further tranche of shares in the forthcoming initial public offering of the company.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to tell the House that Telecom Éireann will announce cuts of £145 million in telephone bills this afternoon. These cuts involve significant reductions in call costs to the US and the UK and is part of the continuing downward pressure on prices in the telecommunications sector which has seen business and the consumer winning out. Further cuts will also be announced.</P>
    <P>The broad terms of the ESOP have been common knowledge for the past year since agreement was reached with the union coalition representing employees in the company in March 1998. As the House is aware, the Telecom Éireann ESOP provides that employees will pay £190 million for 9.9 per cent of the company with an additional 5 per cent acquired in return for company transformation. I note many right wing economic commentators say 14.9 per cent of shares in the company are being given to employees of Telecom Éireann. It appears to be left to the union and me to explain that the employees will pay for the shares. It is necessary to say this very clearly because one cannot issue a correction every time an incorrect comment is made.</P>
    <P>The employees are to receive a shareholding of 14.9 per cent in the company which will be transferred to an employee share ownership trust. A total of 9.9 per cent of the State's shares in the company will be transferred to the ESOT from the outset on payment to the Exchequer of the agreed price. The sale of the 9.9 per cent shareholding is a commercial transaction and the agreed price was based on a valuation of the company which was carried out by expert financial consultants engaged by my Department at the time. An additional 5 per cent will be transferred to the employees in stages on the basis of progress in achieving efficiencies in work practices and cost savings under the Telecom Éireann partnership agreed in 1997 between management and unions in the company.</P>
    <P>The price of the 9.9 per cent will be £190 million payable to the Exchequer by the ESOT. The ESOT will source its funds in the following manner. The company has agreed to make a contribution of £100 million to the ESOT which the company is satisfied represents fair value for employees agreeing to contribute to their pension scheme and waiving their right to certain bonus payments &ndash; a concession by employees which is rarely referred to by commentators. As part of their contribution to the agreement, the employees are paying 5.3 per cent of salary as an employee contribution to the pension fund. Heretofore, the company made the full contribution. A total of £60 million will be raised by the ESOT by way of commercial loan. This loan will be <Col N="1128" /> secured against shares held by the ESOT and will be repaid out of dividends received by the ESOT on its shareholding. The ESOT will make a final payment of £30 million, conditional on a company valuation of at least £2 billion, on a basis which will be without recourse to the company or the State and will take place one year after the date of the initial public offering.</P>
    <P>Final payment will be secured against an appropriate percentage of the shares held by the ESOT and the ESOT loan will provide flexibility to increase its borrowings to facilitate the making of the final payment. The ESOT will receive dividends on its shareholding from the closing of the ESOP transaction.</P>
    <P>The phasing of the transfer of the 5 per cent stake is linked to progress in implementing the Telecom Éireann partnership which was agreed between the company and its unions in 1997. The broad terms of the ESOP which were agreed in March of last year provided that one third of the 5 per cent stage would be transferred to the ESOT from the outset, with the remaining two thirds being transferred in March and December of this year, subject to verification by the company's chief executive that transformation continues to be implemented satisfactorily. At the time, it was envisaged that the ESOP transaction would be concluded by the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>However, as the House knows, the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Act, 1999, which contains a technical provision to facilitate the ESOP, was signed into law only last month. In addition, the definitive legal documentation to give effect to the ESOP took longer to finalise than had been expected by all the parties involved. We have, therefore, passed the date by which the second tranche of the 5 per cent stage was scheduled to be transferred to the ESOT and on the basis of progress to date in implementing the Telecom Éireann partnership, two thirds of the 5 per cent shareholding will be transferred to the ESOT at the closing of the ESOP transaction.</P>
    <P>The ESOT is also entitled to nominate a director for appointment to the board of Telecom Éireann. The unions in Telecom Éireann, through the ESOT, will be nominating Deputy Spring, for appointment on the board of the company as ESOP director. I have already said, here and in the Seanad, how pleased I am with the unions' choice in this regard. Deputy Spring is a highly competent and professional person, and I have no doubt he will be seen as such by the investment community. As I said on previous occasions, this ESOP is an important and innovative agreement, fully in line with the spirit of Partnership 2000 and in accordance with the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>Last July, the unions in Telecom Éireann conducted ballots of their members on the agreed principles of the ESOP, all of which resulted in overwhelming votes in favour of the agreement. Since then, detailed work on the drafting of the <Col N="1129" /> definitive legal documentation to give effect to the ESOP has been ongoing and these are now in place, ready for signing by the parties. The trust deed incorporating the rules and conditions governing ESOP has also been finalised and approved by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The ESOT has also negotiated a loan agreement to part finance the purchase of the 9.9 per cent shareholding. This is a commercial loan and is without recourse to the company or the State. The ultimate objective of the ESOP is to transform Telecom Éireann into a world class telecommunications business through cost reduction, more flexible working arrangements and improved delivery of service to customers.</P>
    <P>Before I refer to the wider context in which the Telecom Éireann ESOP and the forthcoming initial public offering are being undertaken, I wish to address the general principles of the IPO. Deputies will recall that during the debate in this House on the Postal and Telecommunications Services (Amendment) Bill I accepted an amendment which gives rise to the motion now before the House and which provided for the approval of Dáil Éireann to be obtained before the State disposes of shares in Telecom Éireann. The text of that amendment was subject to some discussion at the time and I made it clear that for practical and legal reasons and for reasons of commercial confidentiality I would not, and cannot, discuss the terms, that is the specific details, of the IPO. I do not know them yet. I trust Deputies will appreciate that this remains the position. Accordingly, as required by the Act, I seek approval of the House for the &ldquo;general principles&rdquo; of the sale.</P>
    <P>As a practical matter in flotations of this nature, many of the details involved will not be decided upon until much closer to the IPO date and some issues, such as the definitive offer price and the ultimate split between the retail and institutional offerings, will not be decided upon until immediately prior to the flotation on the various stock exchanges. I have, however, made clear in the general principles which were laid before the House that a minimum of 20 per cent of the shares of Telecom Éireann will be sold in the IPO. Clearly more than 20 per cent will be sold; it is required to indicate a minimum figure. Market conditions and the level of demand for the shares will be critical factors in the determination of these issues.</P>
    <P>While I cannot give an exact timetable as to precise dates because they have yet to be decided, I am able to indicate a broad outline of the planned schedule. The publication of the final prospectus will take place in the middle of June, together with the launch of the application phase of the retail offer and the mini prospectus. Application forms will be issued to all who have registered an interest. In addition, there will be the launch of the institutional offer and the management roadshow commences. By the end of June/early July the retail offer closes, the institutional offer closes, the Government will decide on the final share price and will announce the <Col N="1130" /> allocation to retail investors and trading commences on the stock exchanges.</P>
    <P>Shortly before the launch of the application phase for the retail offer and of the institutional offer, the Government, in conjunction with its advisers, will determine a price range for the shares. This price range will, of course, be without prejudice to the final share price to be determined by Government but it will serve as a guide to prospective retail and institutional investors and will be published in the prospectus which I anticipate will be issued in mid June. Once the prospectus with the share price range has been published, the sales forces from the syndicate of banks will market shares to institutional investors around the world. A process which is referred to as &ldquo;bookbuilding&rdquo; gets under way, that is, institutional investors indicate the volume of shares they are prepared to subscribe for at different prices and a book of orders is built up. This intensive marketing campaign is accompanied by presentations by the senior management of Telecom Éireann to institutional investors. The marketing campaign creates a healthy competitive process among the institutional investors stimulating demand for the shares in line with one of my objectives for the IPO to maximise the proceeds to be returned to the Exchequer from the sale.</P>
    <P>The share price for the institutional offer will be determined having regard to the results of this bookbuilding exercise immediately after the institutional offer closes, which is expected in late June or early July. The retail offer will have closed some days earlier so that the level of retail demand can be included in the book of demand and to enable final work to commence on allocation policy. At that stage, when there is a clear picture of the level of demand for Telecom Éireann's shares from both retail and institutional investors, the Government in conjunction with its advisers will decide the exact proportions to be sold to the retail and institutional sectors and the price of the shares.</P>
    <P>With regard to the retail offer, I am considering whether any incentives should be offered to retail investors and our advisers are looking at precedents in Ireland and elsewhere in this regard. Clearly, the question of whether there should be incentives and, if so, what type, cannot be considered in isolation, and the final decision in this regard will be made later when levels of interest become clearer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proportion of the shares to be offered to retail investors, one of the objectives of the IPO is to promote wider share ownership in this country. To this end I launched a share registration campaign last month. Members of the public are being offered the opportunity to register their interest in the retail share offer and those who register such an interest will receive priority in the allocation of shares over those who do not register in the event of excess demand for shares.</P>
    <P>A major information programme was also initiated in conjunction with the registration cam<Col N="1131" /> paign. This included a mailshot to the 2.8 million adults on the electoral register and a major advertising campaign. The Telecom Éireann share information office, a special service to provide information and support to retail investors and to accept registrations, has also been opened.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out in the debates in March on the IPO Bill both in this House and in the Seanad, we are not a shareholding nation. Indeed, the idea of investing in shares is foreign to many people. However, I wish to ensure that every citizen in the State is given a fair opportunity to participate in the Telecom Éireann IPO. They must, therefore, be made fully aware of the offer through the extensive media campaign now under way and be given the information and support they require to come to an informed decision on whether they should participate.</P>
    <P>While the details of the retail offer have yet to be decided, I confirm that there will be a significant tranche of shares for retail investors. I would like to see a greater allocation to the Irish public than heretofore, but this will be decided by Government at the appropriate time. It would also be my intention to structure the retail offer with the small investor in mind. We want to get the best possible value and there must be an equitable balance between the retail institutions and offerings. Ultimately it is the market which will decide the value of the company. Institutional investors will, therefore, be invited to bid for shares.</P>
    <P>The general principles of the IPO also state that there will be no golden share exercised by the Government post-IPO. The State will be no different from any other shareholder. Three further issues arise. Apart from the Irish Stock Exchange with a parallel listing on the London Stock Exchange, a full listing for Telecom Éireann shares will also be sought on the New York Stock Exchange. This will address aspects such as e-commerce, IT, the call centres and so on.</P>
    <P>Under the strategic alliance agreement of 1996, KPN/Telia have an option to acquire a further 15 per cent shareholding in Telecom Éireann this year for £200 million. KPN/Telia already holds a 20 per cent shareholding in the company which it acquired in 1996 for an initial payment of £183 million. A further amount, representing 60 per cent of the rise in value of KPN/Telia's shareholding above a certain threshold, is also payable to the State. I believe KPN/Telia will exercise its 15 per cent option but the precise timing of such exercise is the subject of ongoing further discussions.</P>
    <P>The price stabilisation mechanism is commonly used in the UK and elsewhere to support a more orderly after-market for new issues or offers of securities. It has the effect of increasing the confidence of investors and the vendor in a flotation. It is already permitted in London and New York and to make it available on the Irish Stock Exchange, the Companies (Amendment) (No. 3) <Col N="1132" /> Bill, 1999, sponsored by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, was passed by the Oireachtas last night. Priority was given to the enactment of this legislation to provide the option for incorporating a stabilisation mechanism in the Telecom Éireann IPO, should the Government so desire at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the wider context in which the IPO is being undertaken and in which the Telecom Éireann ESOP was concluded. In recent years the focus of Government policy has centred on the need to introduce strong and effective competition as this is the best way to ensure consumers, business and residential, enjoy the benefits of the full range of high quality services at competitive prices. To this end the market has been fully opened. As I indicated in recent debates, we focused on liberalising the market and stimulating competition because it is important for this country to have a modern, high-quality telecommunications sector. Within this new liberalised environment we need a strong and competitive Telecom Éireann if our plans for Ireland are to be realised.</P>
    <P>The ESOP is of major importance to Telecom Éireann, its employees and customers. There is still, however, an element of begrudgery. On the sum of £190 million, it is as if 14.9 per cent of the shares have been handed over to Con Scanlon in the CWU free of charge. That is a lie and anyone who writes this is peddling incorrect information. Some 9.9 per cent of the shares have been paid for. The remaining 5 per cent are linked to the transformation process. The ESOP brings important responsibilities as well as benefits. If one has a stake in a company, one will want it to work in order to secure dividends. The employees of the company are rising to the challenge.</P>
    <P>The IPO is a logical follow-on from the strategic alliance with KPN-Telia and the ESOP which have changed the ownership structure of the company. There is a broad level of consensus for the flotation. This is testament to our evolving strategy towards the company and the sector in general in recent years. Approximately 980,000 have registered and are seeking more information on the flotation. I will listen with interest to what my colleagues have to say. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with two issues, the ESOT and the IPO. The Minister accepted an amendment tabled by Deputy O'Shea that following the passage of the telecommunications legislation providing for the IPO a motion should be tabled in response to queries raised about a number of issues. It was my expectation that the Government would determine the number of shares to be made available, be it 20 per cent or 50 per cent, to retail and institutional investors. We are being asked, however, to approve the <Col N="1133" /> motion without knowing what the Government's proposals are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion should be part of a sequence of events. We should see the Government's hand. The issue of price will be dealt with later. My party's approach &ndash; the Minister's rhetoric strongly points in the same direction &ndash; is that Telecom Éireann is a public asset owned by its 1.1 million subscribers. When driving home the other day, a listener rang Eamon Dunphy's radio programme or &ldquo;The Last Word&rdquo; to ask why do we have to buy something that we already own? This is not akin to selling shares in Sherry Fitzgerald or the EBS or oil company stock. It is the first time we have gone down this route. Depending on demand, if necessary, almost all the shares should be sold retail.</P>
      <P>I have proposed that everyone who registers should be able to buy up to £3,000 worth of shares. The Minister implied on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that under my proposal anyone who applies for less than £3,000 worth of shares would suffer.</P>

      <P>Under my proposal Kate and Mary would be able to buy £100 or £200 worth of shares but no one would be able to buy £50,000 worth. It is clear from the Minister's speech and her high-powered £40 million advisers, Merrill Lynch and AIB Capital Markets, that the argument is that the price will not be achieved unless institutional shareholders bid. It is my advice that the share issue will be well oversubscribed.</P>
      <P>Cablelink was valued initially at £150 million to £180 million. This increased to £240 million to £260 million and subsequently to £350 million. It was sold for £535 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A great price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, but Telecom Éireann is valued at £5.5 billion. On the day the ESOT was launched it was valued at £2 billion. It could make £8 billion or £9 billion. The one certainty is that the share issue will be well oversubscribed. The Minister should make a political decision that the lion's share will be allocated to retail investors to whom a minimum of 35 per cent &ndash; the Minister can sell 50.1 per cent &ndash; should be made available. Judging from what happened in the case of British Telecom and in other European states, this is the best opportunity to sell shares to the public. I understand that once bidding starts there will be a windfall profit. There will be a minimum 17 per cent mark-up. It could be as high as 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument may be made to the Minister that it would be easier to raise money from institutional investors who own blocks of shares of, say, 4.7 per cent or 5 per cent to meet future capi<Col N="1134" /> tal needs of Telecom Éireann. I totally disagree with that argument because there are so many structures for rights issues and bonds and so many new financial devices in place for Telecom Éireann in its future plc life and when it is quoted on the Nasdaq and these exchanges. There will be so many bankers and equity institutions throwing money at Telecom Éireann, that will not be an issue.</P>
    <P>One of the things about ESOT is that they cannot sell the 5 per cent within five years and the 9.9 per cent within ten years. The firmer the long-term loyalty of the shareholding base, the better. Mrs. Murphy is far less likely to go for a return whereas if a stockbroker in Manhattan, New York, buys shares, he will look to buy other shares the following week and will sell. Stockbrokers will simply look at Telecom Éireann for a killing &ndash; a quick buck and a speculative gain. We are treading historic territory in terms of democratic ownership. The rhetoric is going in one direction but the Minister's advisers are going in a different one &ndash;  they are buck building. Some 35 per cent should go to the public. That may be somewhat short of the £3,000 but even if it was £2,500 or £2,000, it would really boost registration and give effect to what the Minister wants.</P>
    <P>I have read reports about a row pertaining to a matter to which the Minister did not refer in her speech. She said nice things about Deputy Spring and so on. I understand Mr. Cassells and ICTU have been in and out of Government Buildings saying they want to retain one worker-director in the new company. I thought the Minister might mention that in her speech because when debating Committee and Report Stages&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer a question on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;she said she was about to have meetings. The Minister was very open and supportive of that point of view. I read in a report in the<i> Irish Independent</i> that Department officials said this could not be done. I will get the Minister the report on the toing and froing on this issue if she wants it. I would like clarification on whether a single worker-director will be retained on the board after the IPO is complete? If this cannot be done, what is the impediment? </P>
      <P>The report states that senior officials at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Public Enterprise are to meet Telecom Éireann trade union leaders to try to defuse a dispute over worker-directors and that the unions have threatened to take industrial action. It goes on to state that it appears the Department of Public Enterprise has serious difficulties now with the idea of worker-directors. The Minister told us in good faith she would deal with this issue so what is happening?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I also strongly advocate in regard to the IPO that there should be a loyalty bonus for those who retain the shares and stay with the company for a five year period. The Minister did not mention that in her speech. Since we are accepting the bona fides of this by not opposing the motion, the Minister should include such a loyalty bonus. That is even more important for the company than the discount issue. What period does the Minister have in mind? What are the terms of any loyalty bonus?</P>
      <P>I do not need to rehash the difficulties with the former and new chairmen and vice chairmen &ndash; difficulties which were self-inflicted. Mr. Thompson did not last very long despite what we were told in the beginning. I know the Minister is greatly discomfited by any reminder of this saga, and I hope she will be more sure-footed in future.</P>
      <P>My key point on that aspect of the IPO is that a minimum of 35 per cent of the stakeholding be sold. That means we will have to increase the total amount sold to the public, that the balance only should go to the retail sector, that retail institutional space is based on that political decision, that an amount up to £3,000 based on the final registration amount will be a prerogative in that and that there is a loyalty bonus for those who stay after a certain number of years.</P>
      <P>The Minister was a little touchy or defensive in her speech about any criticism of the way the ESOT has transpired. She even went as far as to say she was the only one to defend it. I am not in the business of defending the Minister's decision; that is not my job. My job is to probe the Minister's decisions. I actively support employee shareholding in the public and private sectors. It is a very good way of giving a stake to people in their own productivity in what are very competitive enterprises. In many businesses, the people are the company.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept her negotiation of ESOP or ESOT provides a precedent or yardstick by which future ESOPs will be considered? In other words, is the Minister setting out as her stall the 5 per cent and the 9.9 per cent? We have the One World Alliance and the potential IPO the Minister has advocated for Aer Lingus, subsequent to the One World Alliance. The position as regards Aer Rianta is up in the air as is that pertaining to the Great Southern Hotel Group, which has more than 800 employees. Electricity is also moving into a bold new world. Is the Minister, as a representative of Government, saying this is the way we intend to proceed? I do not mean something warm, rhetorical and dripping with sincerity but something concrete like the 9.9 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The difference between the deal the Minister did and KPN-Telia is the 60 per cent clawback. I agree with ESOT, the price at which it was struck and the terms on which it was done. Why did the Minister not include a clawback? At the time the shares were valued at £2 billion, and we know the current estimate is £5.5 billion and rising. We are going to put a value on the shareholding which could be astronomically higher than was envisaged the day the Minister signed the deal. The Department officials the same people now advising the Minister, were crafty enough with KPN-Telia to include a clawback provision.</P>

Was the Minister not determined to see ESOT through and to safeguard the rights of workers but that if market forces show it is worth much more than we could have speculated, we should do what we did with KPN-Telia and include 50 per cent clawblack? I think a clawback might have been a prudent measure and would have allowed the Minister defend herself against the criticisms now being made.</P>

If the Minister wishes to make her mark she should put down a clear marker by say<Col N="1138" /> ing she will earmark at least £1 billion of the proceeds for the purpose of public transport. That would be a political decision which could not be taken by the people in the Department of Public Enterprise and which would require the Minister to deliver at the Cabinet table.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo. Tá an díospóireacht ar bun mar ghlac an tAire le leasú uaim nuair a bhí an Bille os comhair na Dála. Molaim an tAire as ucht sin.</P>
      <P>This debate is taking place because the Minister accepted an amendment of mine when the amending legislation was before the House. I praise her for that as it strengthened accountability to the House, something which is important as in some ways the role of the House can be weakened through some of the legislation passed by it.</P>
      <P>An issue of very great importance is worker participation. Leaving the ESOT and ESOP to one side, I am referring to worker representation on the board of Telecom Érieann which will be a private company given that the majority of shares will have moved from the State by the end of the transaction. There is a wider question in relation to this matter and I hope that what the Minister has agreed to in this context will become Government policy in the event of further privatisations of public enterprises and that a debate such as this will take place when a motion has to be passed by the Dáil approving further proposals. At what stage are discussions between Congress and the Department of the Taoiseach in relation to worker participation on the boards of public enterprises which become privatised? I think the Minister agrees that a comprehensive approach in this regard is necessary. Legislation is required to ensure that in all future sales provision is made for a worker representative on boards. Here we are dealing with a specific situation which must be rectified in the context of the smooth running of this exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, I share other Members' admiration of Deputy Spring regarding representation in the <Col N="1139" /> context of ESOT. However, another issue is the principle of worker participation. I would extend the concept beyond public companies which are privatised to all boards, although this is a wider question which does not relate to the responsibilities of the Department of Public Enterprise. It is extremely important that there is worker participation on the board of this changed company and that we set a precedent for future developments.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will not vote against the motion, but another issue which perplexes me is why it was so important that this company should be the subject of these transactions at this time. Telecom Éireann is performing well and making a profit, but a great deal of taxpayers' money has been invested in it. What is the reason for doing this now?</P>
    <P>The asset belonged solely to the people until the strategic alliance partner was sold a 20 per cent share. I understand Deputy Yates's question about why, if we own it, we need to buy it again, but that is a different question. It has always struck me during my political life that there has been a shortage of equity capital in Ireland. I welcome the Minister's widespread approach to citizens and I am pleased that 2.8 million people have invited to buy shares in the company. The Minister must be the judge of whether the number of shares available to each person is sensitive commercial information. However, some indication of what will be available would be useful. It is encouraging that 980,000 people&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearing one million as we speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is increasing all the time. That is welcome because it means the people will own a portion of the asset in a personal as opposed to the collective capacity in which they owned it up to now.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Yates's view that the percentage of shares made available to citizens should be as large as possible and the Minister should make every effort to meet demand. Obviously, the growing number of respondents will not reflect the number of people who will own shares. That said, it is imperative people who indicate a wish to buy shares and who undergo all stages of the process should have their applications granted. The loyalty bonus is a good idea. People will have the option of disposing of their shares if they wish. For those who hold their shares for a specified period, a graduated loyalty bonus is another option the Minister should examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a major transaction in the history of the State and a number of things are being done for the first time. If a high proportion of people seek to buy shares, their demands should be met. Perhaps the Minister would indicate the level of shares which might be on offer to people. It would be self-defeating exercise, if there were many applicants and the number of shares offers <Col N="1140" /> was small. If many people apply, it should be possible for them to avail of a substantial number of shares if that is their desire. If it is capped at a certain level, there could be a problem.</P>
    <P>How will the effective privatisation of Telecom Éireann benefit the consumer? The Minister had good news for us when she announced that there is to be a reduction in the cost of telephone calls to the US and the UK. However, on a related issue, there have been stories told about the recent Cablelink sale concerning the initial valuation of the company. What valuation did Rothschilds put on Cablelink when the matter was first raised at Cabinet? It has been alleged that the sale of the company was made at a level well above the market value. If so, the consumer will pay because it will result in higher prices. There is also the question of necessary investment, and we do not want to see dominant positions developing. This is something which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>What is important is how the initiative will benefit the consumer. We tend to talk too much about people and citizens and what they consume and not enough about their rights and responsibilities. I am concerned that we talk a great deal about certain exercises benefiting the consumer when there is a wider agenda for those people as citizens. That is fundamental to the issue we are debating. Will the citizen benefit from this initiative?</P>
    <P>I welcome the ESOT exercise as a trade unionist and bearing in mind that the Communications Workers' Union negotiated and agreed the package. On the other hand, I do not see it being a precedent for future privatisations. Telecom Éireann is an extraordinarily valuable asset which is part of the technology driving our economy, and there is huge potential in terms of its development and the range of services it can supply to consumers. From the sounds coming from both parties in Government, it seems there will be other privatisations. The Labour Party will take each as it arises and deal with it from there. However, I do not believe we will see too many packages like this one. Are there any plans for the Electricity Supply Board? Some of its employees are concerned about how the future is shaping up and what may develop.</P>
    <P>We will not vote against the motion. We welcome the precedent of bringing the principles of the sale before the House. I hope the Minister will endeavour to convince her colleagues in Government that the Oireachtas should follow this course in future. There is the shareholding aspect and there is the other aspect of the ESOT and worker participation. The Minister has made no provision here for worker participation. The Government should address this and take action on it across the private and public sectors. Worker participation should become a feature of all companies in the economy.</P>
    <P>The present situation calls for a resolution and the Minister should bring it to an early conclusion. Provision was not made for it recently <Col N="1141" /> when the Bill was passed so I am not certain how the Minister intends to deal with this issue when a resolution is reached with congress. In other words, how does the Minister set out the legal imperative when her legislation has already been passed? My point, with which the Minister would probably agree, is that the way to go forward is to make it a general provision this year when a publicly owned company is privatised. That legislation would obviously apply to Telecom Éireann without having to amend the Minister's legislation.</P>
    <P>We should reflect on the fact that we have reached a stage with the IPO and the ESOP that effective ownership of Telecom Éireann has moved out of the public sector. The State is no longer the majority shareholder. I ask the Minister to state the position as regards the shares which will remain after this share offer. Obviously the value of these shares will escalate rapidly and there would then be an opportunity to return to the market and obtain a great deal more for them. Would the Minister be aiming those shares at the institutional sector or the retail sector? There will be a surprisingly high level of take-up from ordinary citizen investors here. If the Minister returns to sell the remaining shares she should devise a means to sell them not to institutional investors but to those who do not avail of the offer on this occasion but who may wish to do so having seen the success of the flotation. She should encourage the development of a culture where the man in the street becomes involved in the purchase of equity capital. Over time that has been a restricting factor in the development of the economy. It has been extraordinarily difficult to generate this kind of capital. Various devices and agencies have been put in place from time to time with varying degrees of success but with no substantial or resounding success. When something like the present offer comes centre stage and it is clear to all that those who avail of the offer will do well out of it, it may have a profound effect on the attitude of people generally towards equity capital.</P>
    <P>Institutions, large corporations, etc., have a certain anti-democratic ambience. When the employees' group of shareholders are in place, is there a proposal to encourage them to unite as a body so that the power of their shareholding can be focused more firmly and reflected in company policy in the future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I welcome the development at Telecom Éireann because it offers a great opportunity to the public and the company. The fact that the employees are being given shares and the public is being allowed to buy shares provides them with an opportunity to buy into the future development of telecommunications, e-commerce and information technology. If the flotation is successful &ndash; no doubt it will be &ndash;  it will provide a wonderful opportunity to develop information technology structures. It will also allow the public to have a say in <Col N="1142" /> the future of a company, the development of which we have all stood by and been proud of over the years and it will provide an opportunity to participate in the development of the company and in the job  creation possibilities which this share option offers.</P>
      <P>The area of deregulation and the new moves being made by Telecom Éireann with regard to the sale of shares not only give the employees and the public an opportunity to have a say in the future of the company but also pose a number of challenges for Telecom Éireann because the telecommunications infrastructure is quite dated whichever way we look at it. Huge sums of money have been invested in the infrastructure but a sizeable sum is needed if the company is to move from its present position to being a world player in terms of the development of information technology and e-commerce. This will be a challenge if the company is to ensure that the whole country participates in the new developments of e-commerce and information technology. This particular technology ensures, if it is available countrywide, that there is no poverty trap. In other words, every community throughout the country has the opportunity to participate in world markets by way of Internet advances and e-commerce transactions. A considerable amount of legislation on security in this regard is needed, but first we must address the area of infrastructure. That is one of the challenges which will face Telecom Éireann in the future. We need to ensure that the telecommunications infrastructure is up to date, that the type of technology required by commercial and residential interests throughout the country is made available to the general public and that the issue of connectivity is dealt with as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to Telecom Éireann's involvement in this huge opportunity, I commend the company on its information age project, which includes pilot projects at Castlebar, Ennis, Kilkenny and Killarney. We must analyse the success of the Telecom projects and compile a checklist on the manner in which communities in project towns have succeeded in interacting with the information technology infrastructure available to them. We must ensure that available technology takes the needs of young people and their parents into account and we must ensure that educational structures in regard to young people's introduction to information technology are up to speed. All the opportunities for future job creation in this country rely on information technology. Telecom must be in a position in the future to play its role in providing the necessary infrastructure for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very small window of opportunity here in regard to e-commerce. I want to highlight the successful participation of some small companies in e-commerce. In my own constituency, the Malone pottery company is successfully transacting business on the Internet. Recently, the Minister visited Kilkenny and acknowledged the company's success in accessing the Internet and <Col N="1143" /> in providing a partnership with NatWest on the security issues. This type of enterprise is an indication of the manner in which small Irish companies can access proper infrastructure and worldwide markets if given the necessary opportunities.</P>
    <P>Much more can be done in this area. E-commerce is not just the preserve of bigger companies which are well prepared to enter the information age. E-commerce is an opportunity of which all citizens can avail. Private and public investment is required if this area is to expand and be capitalised upon. Telecom must take the lead role in this as it has done in regard to information age towns. If it provides the proper investment and initiatives, other private companies will come on board. It will then be necessary for the Government to invest heavily in internal connectivity to ensure all communities are in a position to come on board.</P>
    <P>The opportunities provided for the share option issue will create further prosperity and opportunities for those who purchase shares. As e-commerce develops and the information age is rolled out to each community in Ireland, the allocation of additional shares must be considered. Further opportunities should be provided in the future to those who do not buy shares at their first offering. I welcome the motions before the House and urge the Minister to encourage Telecom to open up the infrastructure market and to encourage small companies' participation in e-commerce activities.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Let us put aside the gloss and the hard sell for a moment. This is a project aimed at the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, an immensely valuable State asset which has been built up over generations by taxpayers on the one hand and the commitment of its workers on the other. The Minister is today presenting the first phase of a plan for the total privatisation of Telecom Éireann. That does not mean that ordinary Irish people will democratically own this valuable national asset. Telecom will end up in the hands of the major grabbers from the international stock exchanges, banks, financial institutions and other players in the world capitalist market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is already privatising and planning to privatise State assets with complete abandon. It is amazing to hear the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with hardly a reference to the Government, promising the private sector that it will soon be in a position to take over bridges, water reservoirs and so on. Without as much as a nod in the direction of the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Tánaiste also informed us that Aer Lingus, another valuable State asset, will be privatised and given into the hands of major investors. This has all happened with scarcely a murmur of opposition from Fine Gael, whose only probable criticism is that the privatisation programme is not <Col N="1144" /> being pursued with sufficient vigour, or the Labour Party. That is quite shameful.</P>
    <P>In her speech the Minister concentrated on what she doubtless views as the selling points of the Telecom Éireann privatisation and religiously ignored some of the shameful aspects of the process. The Minister failed to mention in any detailed way how the second 5 per cent which will go to the employee shared ownership trust ties into efficiencies and cost cutting. She stated that the additional 5 per cent will be transferred to the employees in stages, on the basis of progress in achieving efficiencies in work practices and cost savings under the Telecom partnership agreed in 1999 between management and unions in the company. What does that mean in practice? The answer is quite bluntly laid out in the booklet given to employees entitled &ldquo;Employee Share Ownership Plan &ndash; Your Questions Answered&rdquo;. One of the questions reads: &ldquo;Does the 5 per cent depend on all aspects of the transformation document, including 2,500 job losses over five years?&rdquo;. The answer is yes. However, it goes on to state that all staff reductions will be effected on a voluntary basis. That in no way compensates for a catastrophic loss in the employment potential of the State sector.</P>
    <P>The fact that people may voluntarily agree to take redundancies on certain terms will cover over the fact that 2,500 vacancies will not be available in the future for young people coming into the jobs market. That may not be very noticeable at the moment when the economy is growing rapidly but when the capitalist cycle turns, as it inevitably will, we will be faced once again with the catastrophe of growing unemployment. Those 2,500 jobs will be dearly missed but there is not a murmur of opposition. Competition is the god. The full complement of employees could be kept by diversifying and extending the remit of this valuable State company in an imaginative way. That is not the agenda, however,the agenda is to sell off this asset.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated how pleased she was that Deputy Spring has been appointed to the board of the company, that he is a competent and professional person who will be seen as such by the investment community. I have no doubt he will be seen as such as well. It is entirely appropriate for the person who booted the ideas of James Connolly, democratic socialism and State ownership as a principle out of the constitution of the Labour Party. No doubt the capitalists who want to get their hands on Telecom Éireann can be fully confident. It is a despicable reflection on the Labour Party and how far it has gone in its betrayal of the concept of public ownership, democratic accountability and democratic ownership of vital State assets, a fundamental of the ideas of democratic socialism espoused by James Connolly, the founder of the Labour Party. Now the party does not raise a murmur in Opposition to this or any other privatisation which might be proposed. I am proud that workers are beginning to fight. I commend the workers from the Great <Col N="1145" /> Southern Hotel chain who came to the Dáil last night to protest against the privatisation of a flourishing State asset. I level the same criticism at the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Minister say that one of the objectives of the share offer generally, and a personal objective of hers, is to promote wider share ownership. That is almost exactly what Mrs. Thatcher said when she came to power in Britain. Today, following the confidence trick on ordinary working people in Britain, fewer shares are now in the hands of working class people and more are in the hands of the investors, bankers and major institutions.</P>
    <P>That will happen here. The Minister will trick the ordinary people with the soft sell and the mail shots which tell people that if they put a few hundred pounds in, it will be a wise investment. For most of those people an exigency will arise. A family crisis or some such thing will result in them having to sell the shares off. Who will be there to purchase them? Once ordinary people have spent their money buying the shares, they will be snapped up by the investors and bankers.</P>

His suggestion that the transfer of a significant stake in Telecom Éireann to the workforce of that company is a travesty strikes me as odd in the extreme, even when one considers that the trend on the left in Europe, Britain and here is towards the idea of greater participation by the workforce in the operations of the companies for which they work. We are entering an era of more responsible capitalism which is more responsive to its own workforce.</P>

      <P>&mdash;capitalists are learning that the shift to the knowledge based industries means that employers, often depicted by Deputy Higgins as greedy and ruthless individuals, are realising that they must invest in people. That is an international trend and I am glad it has been reflected in the shifting position of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>The idea that the State must be involved <i>ipso facto</i> in the ownership of industry is outdated. It was a good idea when it was initiated. It could be suggested that 60 years ago the private sector in this State was not strong enough and the international private sector was not responsible enough to reflect to the social dimensions of the economy. Now, however, there is an increasing realisation that the private sector is prepared to invest its money in the people and the companies.</P>
      <P>In such an era, State ownership is irrelevant. The whole issue was placed in a new and dramatic light when the late John Smith, then leader of the British Labour Party, suggested the idea of the state playing an enabling role for its citizens. That view is shared on the Labour Party benches. The State does not exist to own vast tracts of the economy, be they airlines, telecommunications companies or electricity production companies. The State has evolved and we have moved on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a State which seeks to regulate in the same manner in which a referee regulates a football game. It blows the whistle when the capitalists so often decried by Deputy Higgins get out of control. That is the role of the State &ndash; to reign in private enterprise when it shows its greed in an unwholesome manner. That has been its role since Mr. Haughey brought Fianna Fáil into Government in 1987. That was when the trend for privatisation started. The trend is on track and will pay dividends. We owe much of our economic success to these privatisations. They freed up large companies which were, unfortunately, placed in the invidious position of the State not having the <Col N="1147" /> wherewithal to reinvest in them to meet the competitive challenges of a more globalised market, yet they had to achieve certain efficiencies in terms of how they operated.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with the Minister's proposal. It shows the caring side of the Government's method of action. A 14 per cent equity for the workforce in a company is an enormous contribution.</P>

The Government should examine the wider issue of equity participation by the workforce generally in industry, which is clearly a problem throughout the European economy. I hope this decision by the Government sets a trend for the private sector at large, whereby workers are given a proper dividend from the profits of successful companies and, if the companies are not doing well, take the cuts that go with that.</P>

      <P>There has been a disappointing trend in recent years, across all political parties, of not having the nerve to go the full five years. This four year electoral cycle is also damaging from an economic viewpoint. It would be more beneficial if Governments were prepared to set a trend and remain in power for the full five years. Six year terms might introduce a degree of stability. Deputy Higgins might even welcome a six year term, during which he could outline his stagist theory which would bring about the revolution.</P>
      <P>The Minister has set a headline on the issue of equity participation in respect of companies moving from the public to the private sector. This will lead to greater demands when we come to the electricity issue and other companies. The Government should emphasise its determination to continue this initiative which guarantees the workforce and the trade unions &ndash; the people who have contributed to the success of these companies over the years &ndash; a payback from the privatisation of their companies. It is the ideal way to balance the obvious disadvantages they suffer in terms of security. There is no point pretending conditions of employment are as secure in the private sector as they are in the public sector, and workers who move to the private sector are being given adequate compensation and participation. I hope the Government continues this trend right across industry.</P>
      <P>There is a problem of wage inflation in the marketplace. In the long-term we have to view this economy in terms of non-pay rewards for a workforce that wishes to develop its relationship with a company. An ideal way to do this would be to allow equity participation by ordinary members of staff. That would also dampen down inflationary wage demands&mdash;</P>

I was a little uncertain, but I did say that, under trade union rules, collective bargaining would be the norm in a matter such as that. The details of the proposal were outlined to staff at trade union meetings throughout the company and were accepted in ballots by an overall majority of members in all the trades unions. The staff of the company were given formal individual invitations to participate in accordance with the joint conciliation council collective agreement. The first two pay increases due under Partnership 2000 were implemented. The company informed me that more than 99.9 per cent of the staff have opted to participate and, as of today, only six individuals out of a total of 12,000 have declined, and the door remains open to them</P>

      <P>BIM's Seafood Industry Agenda 2000-2006 plan highlights the economic opportunities which a cohesive and innovative investment strategy can deliver for the Irish seafood sector and the communities which it supports. It sets a very ambitious agenda backed up by the necessary supporting analysis. I welcome the fact that the industry itself has given its full backing to this strategic approach as did Deputies in the course of the recent debate in the House on BIM's plan. BIM's programme over the period envisages a total investment of £364 million to which EU and Exchequer funding would contribute £198 million and the industry £166 million. This points to a new level of investment confidence within the sector itself. I am committed to working with the sector and BIM to build on the significant achievements to date and to move ahead with new and innovative strategies based on sustainability, quality, competitiveness as well as responsiveness to consumer needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many key respects we have already begun to break the mould. We are delivering renewal of the whitefish fleet, increased investment in fisheries infrastructure, a new market driven focus on value added and marine research and development and new impetus for growth in aquaculture <Col N="1153" /> and fish processing. The challenge now is to secure the necessary investment support to consolidate and move ahead.</P>
    <P>I will be working with Government colleagues to secure the necessary investment support in the next round to underpin the development of the Irish seafood industry and of the marine and natural resources sectors generally. BIM's Seafood Industry Agenda is a critical contribution to the current debate on national investment priorities. That debate is taking place in the context of overall stiff competition for resources and many national challenges, but I believe we have a convincing and well backed up case for funding support for the seafood sector.</P>

Would he agree that the Irish investment is estimated at £45 million which leaves £7 million a year for the operational programme? If there is a European Union deficit in the amount of funding, will the Minister make sure that funding for Ireland is increased accordingly? I want a definite commitment to put this into the national development plan for consideration.</P>

A number of other proposals along similar lines have been put forward, including proposals from the social partners, endorsing what BIM is doing and adding to its proposals. All these proposals are being considered together by my Department and are being included in the overall proposal. It is important that there be a well focused presentation. The BIM proposal was excellent. The other submissions were also very good. They have to be brought together and focused in terms of the main contribution. That is what I intend to do.</P>

      <P>I am implementing progressively the key recommendations of the Salmon Management Task Force report together with other initiatives in relation to salmon conservation and management. When I published and endorsed the Marine Institute's technical report on the task force recommendations last year, I made it clear that salmon strategies would be implemented in line with the views of the task force and my stated objectives for the salmon resource.</P>
      <P>I have renewed the key conservation measures recommended by the task force in 1998 and again in 1999. I am also progressively introducing new measures to protect spring salmon stocks. These additional measures include a ban on the use of prawn and shrimp bait until 1 June and the planned closing of spring salmon black spot rivers next year until 1 May.</P>
      <P>The national fish county programme is designed to address the data gap highlighted by the task force. I have announced an expansion in the fish counter installation programme with a further 16 planned to be in place by 2001.</P>
      <P>I have endorsed catchment management as the way forward and six pilot projects are under way to test and develop the concept. The pilot projects led by the regional fisheries boards are in progress on the Vartry, Barrow, Laune, Mulkear, Moy and Bundrows and will critically inform overall national catchment management strategies.</P>
      <P>Salmon tagging was a key recommendation of the task force. Real time monitoring and management of salmon stocks will enable the operation of an effective total allowable catch and quota scheme. Substantial practical progress has been made by the tagging working group in consultation with all the interests. The intention has been to introduce the tagging scheme this year but it became clear that further consultation was needed with the commercial sector as well as anglers. I have set a new target date of January 2000 which I am confident will be met. It is in the interests of both the salmon sector and the anglers that we have all the practical and legal aspects of the scheme agreed and clarified.</P>
      <P>Nominees have been sought to the National Salmon Commission from the various salmon interests, and I will finalise the membership and chair of the commission shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A principal officer in the Department is in charge of a section dealing with this and other aspects of inland fisheries. Some of the measures which have been introduced already include: a reduction in the number of days for commercial salmon fishing from five to four days per week; a ban on night-time fishing with driftnets; a reduction in the area for fishing at sea from 12 miles to six miles; a reduction in the length of the open season for commercial driftnet fishing to two months, June and July; deferral of the draughtnet open season until 12 May; cap and reduction on the number of commercial licences; and relaxation of monofilament ban.

      <P>The main interest the EU has taken in this matter involves a ban on driftnet fishing of tuna. We have negotiated a phased-in approach to it so that it will not apply fully until 2002. Our fishermen in the south-west in particular are glad of that. The phasing in will follow an immediate initial reduction. Proposals were also made to ban driftnet fishing for salmon, but we were not in favour of that as an immediate step. The European Commission has set aside the pro<Col N="1156" /> posals for the present, but I have no doubt that approach will reappear internationally. We are involved in various international discussions concerning salmon fishing. A major conference will take place here in a couple of weeks time. The issue continues to be central to the fishing debate and we will keep in touch with it.</P>

      <P>I can confirm for the Deputy that plans are being finalised for the Seaweed Forum and all the relevant players and organisations are currently being invited to participate. I will be inviting a member of the Irish Seaweed Industry Organisation to chair the forum and I will announce the chairperson and the membership shortly. I have also asked the Marine Institute to take a leading role in supporting and facilitating the work of the forum. The composition of the forum will be drawn from the lrish Seaweed Industry Organisation &ndash; six nominations &ndash; Arramara Teoranta, UCG &ndash; two nominations &ndash; UCC, the Marine Institute, BIM, Údarás na Gaeltachta and my Department.</P>
      <P>The forum will be the key consultation phase in developing a legislative framework within which to develop the seaweed industry to its full potential. The outcome of the forum's work will therefore critically inform and assist the preparation of an Alginate Industries Bill, as signalled in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>The overall remit of the Seaweed Forum will be to examine and report on the potential for the development of seaweed resources, with a particular focus on value added. The forum will: evaluate the current state of knowledge of the seaweed resource and its economic contribution; consult widely with the relevant participants and industry players; investigate the potential uses of seaweed, taking into account future research needs and global market opportunities; examine any barriers to realising the sector's potential; and make recommendations to overcome these.</P>
      <P>There are undoubted opportunities for new directions in the seaweed industry, to the benefit of our coastal communities. The findings of the Seaweed Forum will help us to set those new directions and will stimulate new thinking, enterprise and innovation in the seaweed sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why it is taking so long to establish the Seaweed Forum? In June 1998 he issued a press release announcing he would establish a Seaweed Forum and that the chairman would be appointed shortly. On 6 July 1998, in Galway, the Minister of State at the <Col N="1157" /> Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, delivered a speech on the matter, on the Minister's behalf. In September 1998 the Minister stated that he would establish a forum to develop the seaweed industry.</P>
      <P>While the Minister had announced last June that he would appoint a chairman shortly, it took a further nine months to complete a report on the Seaweed Forum. Now that the Minister is about to appoint the chairman and other members of the forum, will he elaborate on how long it will take? What impact will this have on the Alginate Industries Bill, which is pending? I have referred to the legislation many times in the Chamber. I cannot understand the Minister's procrastination on this issue and his repetitive press releases, given that he has failed to deliver on it until now when he has been put under pressure to do so.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the names of selected individuals had to be submitted. The industry has been in a very difficult situation and, in that sense, it has not been so focused. The industry currently has serious commercial problems. The recent economic downturn in the Asian market led to a great deal of uncertainty and difficulty, and because of that the various sectors are refocusing their efforts. Some parts of the industry are being made available on the open market. While the industry has been going through a difficult period, nonetheless it could work out as an advantage eventually.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty concerned finalising the servicing of the sector. Nothing had previously been provided for it and the Deputy is aware of the limitations on staff. I understand that the Marine Institute will service it and that will be very helpful from our point of view. I regret it has taken so long to get the Seaweed Forum off the ground but I can assure the Deputy it will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>BIM's Seafood Industry Agenda 2000-2006 proposes a total investment pro<Col N="1158" /> gramme for the sector as a whole of £364 million, of which the proposed EU and Exchequer contribution is £198 million, and that of the private sector is £166 million. As the Deputy points out, the BIM plan estimates spending as between the Objective One region and Objective One region in transition of 68 per cent and 32 per cent respectively. I stress, however, that these regional allocations proposed by BIM are indicative only. While I expect that they are based on BIM's analysis of existing investment trends and projections for both productive and infrastructural investment in the fisheries sector, any such allocations will be determined ultimately in light of all the regional and sectoral development objectives and factors.</P>
      <P>It is the case, of course, that BIM's aquaculture development programme envisages a very significant increase in investment support for the sector over the period. The investment support programmes for the aquaculture sector can be expected to take due account of the spatial distribution of aquaculture development around the coast. As the Deputy points out, there is a considerable concentration of aquaculture activity in the south-west region.</P>
      <P>The issue of how much overall public investment should take place in each of the regions remains to be addressed in the context of decisions in relation to the national development plan and having regard to all relevant factors. The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to pre-empt the outcome of that process but I can assure him that the investment needs of the aquaculture industry in the south-west region will not be overlooked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The combined State and EU funding is £28 million. Is the Minister satisfied that that is enough to keep the aquaculture industry afloat? I do not think so. It is peanuts. Furthermore, the Minister has not explained if 68 per cent of the funding will be confined to the Objective One region while the south-west will get only 32 per cent. That anomaly must be corrected because over 50 per cent of aquaculture development is taking place south of a line from Aran Islands to Bannow Bay in County Wexford. That area will only get 32 per cent of the funding while <Col N="1159" /> the rest of the country gets 68 per cent. Is the Minister prepared to correct that? Is he prepared to offer an extra £28 million, or £5 million per year, to the southern region, which will be denuded of funds? If not, the industry will go into serious decay and collapse. There will be no future for aquaculture development if we do not get our rightful share of the cake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to have as much aquaculture development in the south-west as possible. The 1994-99 investment under the operational programme, for which this plan was prepared, amounted to £35.5 million for aquaculture related activities. That includes £10.99 million in EU funds, £1.9 million in Irish contribution and £17.7 million in private investment. There were 118 projects and 552 whole time job equivalents were generated. The BIM programme proposes that that level goes up in the next period from £35.5 million to £62.5 million, so there is a considerable increase in the overall demand from BIM. This is in line with development &ndash; there is already development taking place in this area &ndash; and Deputy Sheehan can be assured that I will keep this in mind when the Government is considering the national plan.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of development in the south and south-west and Donegal has many problems and needs development. I see the reasoning in BIM's proposals as well as the fact that it is dealing with the Objective One area rather than the area which is Objective One in transition. This is something we will have to do our best to deal with when the time comes. The whole sector has a lot of potential for development. The Deputy will know that in 1980 output in this sector was under £2 million per annum and that is now over £60 million per annum and increasing. We have a big backlog of projects ready to go ahead also. That will have to be addressed by the Government and the BIM proposals are part of that.</P>

      <P>No application has been made to me or my Department for a foreshore lease or licence under the Foreshore Acts to allow works of the nature described in the question. I am aware from a newspaper report that a breach, to be covered by a 300 metre long bridge, has been proposed but the proposal has not, as yet, been adopted by Dublin Corporation. If such an application is received it will be subject to a public consultation process and be carefully considered. My Department has no funds available to it for such works. Dublin Corporation is aware of the need for a foreshore licence or lease to carry out works of the nature described.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Dublin Corporation commissioned a consultant's study which was published in June 1996 following which the city council adopted a motion calling on the corporation to take all necessary steps to restore fishing, boating and swimming between Bull Island and the mainland.</P>

It is also dear to the Minister as his constituency joins mine. I walk one part of the area and I think I see him on the other side of the causeway. Some of the ushers of the House who are present are also very familiar with this area.</P>
      <P>In order to proceed with a true reflection of the public's desire regarding the breach in the causeway, and the ESBI report indicated three different breaches, will the Minister agree to a round table meeting with Dublin Corporation and me to discuss how best we can go about an application for a foreshore licence or lease or other ways to resolve this matter?</P>

      <P>I would be happy to pursue this very important matter with the Deputy. The corporation controls this area and carried out studies to examine possible solutions. It has offered a number of solutions and the council apparently took the view that the corporation should take all steps necessary to restore fishing, boating and swimming between Bull Island and the mainland.</P>
      <P>That would involve a breach and the foreshore lease is one aspect; technical and engineering matters are another issue. I would be happy to meet representatives of the Department of the Environment and Local Government as well as the corporation to discuss this matter as I am aware that it is a major concern and must be addressed urgently.

      <P>The ongoing development of the seafood industry critically depends on the provision of safe, modern and efficient harbours and landing facilities and other onshore infrastructure. I am firmly committed to delivering the necessary level of investment which will underpin the competitiveness and efficiency of the fishing, processing and aquaculture sectors.</P>
      <P>The fishery harbours development programme for 1999 provides for expenditure of more than £7 million at key strategic fishery harbours including Killybegs, Dingle, Castletownbere, Burtonport, Greencastle and Kilmore Quay. In addition, the small harbours programme I announced last month will facilitate and support upgrading and development works at a further 41 locations in eight counties. This important initiative represents a total investment of almost £4 million and will be a major boost for the local coastal communities in question and for the aquaculture sector and inshore fishermen in particular. These investments will also, in many instances, have the added benefit of underpinning local development and jobs in sea angling, marine tourism and leisure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that a major contribution has been made to the major ports by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, I am concerned about the neglect of minor ports. Does the Minister agree that the reason for this is that most of the smaller ports are under the control of local authorities and therefore have been and continue to be neglected by the Department? Local authorities do not have the money and the Department does not have the responsibility for the development of smaller ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To a large extent that was, and to some extent still is the case. However, this year I <Col N="1162" /> established a special fund for those harbours and £4 million will be spent on them. Combined expenditure under the fishery harbours programme and the new small harbours programme means an increase of almost 350 per cent over 1998. This is a very large increase in infrastructural spending. Local authorities contribute £1 million and Government contributes £3 million to the special fund for small harbours which has enabled many of the projects which local authorities wished to undertake, to be tackled. A large number of projects are spread over various counties.</P>
      <P>It is now up to local authorities to come forward with their priorities. I hope we can continue this programme and even enhance it. This year will show the value of the programme to local authorities, including the area of activity mentioned by the Deputy. If local authorities come forward with further proposals we will look at them.</P>

I would like to see local authorities being encouraged to submit proposals in this way. A number of harbour developments have been related to aquaculture but I could not allow all the money to be spent on aquaculture. Some money has been allocated to marine leisure and other forms of development so that a balance is struck. The programme is a very good one and will encourage more development in this area.</P>

      <P>A proposed development plan for Bantry harbour was prepared by the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners in conjunction with Cork County Council in 1997 and submitted to my Department for consideration. It sets out a range of development options for the harbour, including Bantry pier itself, with estimated costs ranging between £4.8 million and £7.8 million.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Real time entry-exit reporting, catch reporting and satellite monitoring are the key components of a package of fisheries management and control measures negotiated by Ireland at the time of the Iberian Accession to the Common Fisheries Policy. The measures are primarily designed to ensure that all fishing activity in the Irish zone is managed and monitored transparently and on a real time basis. EU fishing vessels transiting fishery zones or entering or leaving ports must report their entry and exit to the Irish fisheries control service.</P>
      <P>Vessels are also obliged since July 1998 to simultaneously report their on-board catches. These reports are made to the Naval Supervisory Centre at Haulbowline which is the central repository for fisheries surveillance data. Monitoring for compliance with these reporting requirements is a key inspection task for the Naval Service vessels. To ensure the most effective enforcement of these requirements by naval vessels, the development of a fully integrated fisheries surveillance system capability is in progress. This system will enable comprehensive on-line access to, and data retrieval by, the Naval Service at sea communicating with the Haulbowline data base.</P>
      <P>All data bases and communicating systems are being upgraded with, in addition, the immediate objective of ensuring that all systems are Y2K compliant. I understand that incremental progress has been made but in common with all EU member states considerable work remains to be done to put all the operational and data systems in place for maximum coverage and data utilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is working with the Department of Defence and the Naval Service to ensure comprehensive delivery within a reasonable timeframe. In the meantime the existing systems will continue to be utilised to the full to ensure that <Col N="1165" /> all vessels, including flagships, make the necessary reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister refers to comprehensive surveillance will he consider the weighbridge approach, as he indicated in private conversation with fishermen in Brussels last December? It means that when flagships converge on a certain area they are subject to inspection by the Naval Service and are then subject to further inspection on leaving. Does the Minister agree that if we adopted this system, which has been so successfully used by the Norwegians, it would probably lead to the collection of more valid information, including information on conservation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem. We cannot do what they do because we are bound by EU regulations and rules. The nearest we can approximate to the Norwegian system is to have a check when vessels enter and leave the zone, with reporting in both instances. The system is designed to ensure that vessels are first monitored on satellite. Second, they will have to return real time-current time reports on what they hold on entering and leaving any specified area. That is our equivalent to the weighbridge in the sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct because not all the boats go to one point.

It manages and operates three co-ordination-communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia, 12 remote VHF sites, two voice repeater sites and 50 coastal emergency response stations providing short coverage. The IMES has contracted two civilian Sikorski S61N search and rescue helicopters, one based in Shannon Airport and the second in Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>In addition to its own resources, IMES has a number of declared resources available to it on a 24 hour basis all year round. These include two Air Corps search and rescue helicopters based at Finner, County Donegal, and Waterford Airport, the RNLI, which has 24 lifeboat stations around the coast, and six community in-shore rescue service boats based in strategic locations. While the IMES helicopters are based at Shannon and Dublin Airports and an Air Corps helicopter is based at Finner, they are available on a 24-hour, 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline. I am satisfied that the level of coverage available on all Irish coasts meets both national and international standards for marine search and rescue operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to plans to develop the service, a number of measure are being considered at present. These include the development of IMES as a national coastguard service and the extension of the remit of IMES to cover inland waterways. A VHF digital selective calling system for automatic alerting by vessels in distress is being installed at all VHF remote sites and will be fully operational by the end of this year. Other measures include an expenditure review of IMES, aimed at increasing its efficiency and effectiveness. This has been carried out by consultants and <Col N="1167" /> is being examined by my Department's management team; the provision of counter pollution aerial surveillance as a deterrent to polluters and as a means of prosecution and the provision of emergency towage facilities capable of intervening in marine emergency incidents to prevent pollution in our pollution responsibility zone. I have also instituted a major building, restructuring and re-equiping programme for the IMES coastal units and stations. Sites for the expansion of VHF marine radio communications coverage on the north coast, west and north-west coasts are being technically assessed and my Department is currently recruiting four additional personnel, three technical and one administrative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the review of efficiency at the IMES, of which I approve. I return to a question I raised in an Adjournment debate in the hope that the Minister may have reconsidered his answer. The busiest marine centre by far on the south coast is Cork Harbour. At present there is no rescue boat in the harbour. Is the Minister aware that on a summer's day in the harbour there may be up to 1,500 people on the water, whether they are fishing, angling, sailing, windsurfing or whatever? In addition, there is no in-shore rescue boat available for the IMES in Crosshaven, despite the presence of human resources and expertise. Is the Minister prepared to make the modest funding necessary to provide an in-shore rescue boat for the area instead of hoping that the RNLI will put a lifeboat into Cork Harbour, which apparently will not happen for a number of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the RNLI which serves the IMES system on a 24 hour basis proposes to provide a service in the harbour. We do not want to duplicate its work. If it is being suggested that there are considerable delays, the matter of an inshore rescue boat can be looked at further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 3 May 1999 a fire occurred on the Stena <Col N="1168" /> Line HSS vessel as it approached Dun Laoghaire from Holyhead. I am advised that the fire occurred in the firetight enclosure enclosing one of the vessel's gas turbine engines for the ship's propulsion. The engine unit's alarm system detected the fire immediately, shut down the engine and the crew operated the fire extinguisher system within the compartment. I am informed that, as the vessel was close to Dun Laoghaire Harbour, the master of the vessel decided not to open the compartment until the vessel was alongside the pier and the fire brigade was in attendance. As a precaution, the master mustered all the passengers and evacuated them using the normal foot exits as soon as the vessel was alongside the pier.</P>
    <P>The marine survey office of my Department was notified immediately of the incident and the deputy chief surveyor from that office boarded the vessel as soon as it was alongside the pier to commence an initial investigation into the cause of the fire. I understand from the deputy chief surveyor that this initial investigation found that a small fire had occurred in the lagging surrounding the engine. All the other engines were inspected and found to be in apparent good order and condition. Following this inspection and after receiving assurances from the fire brigade that the fire was fully extinguished the deputy chief surveyor was satisfied that it was safe for the vessel to return to service, albeit on three engines only.</P>
    <P>The marine survey office is also carrying out an investigation into the incident involving the Stena Line HSS on 4 March 1999 which occurred when the vessel was backing into its berth in Dun Laoghaire in strong north-west by north winds. While the report on this investigation has yet to be completed, I am advised by the chief surveyor of the marine survey office that the vessel collided with a mooring dolphin as a result of which the vessel was holed above the waterline and at water level causing partial flooding of one compartment. An immediate and full inspection of the damage to the vessel was carried out by officials from the marine survey office and temporary repairs were effected to ensure it was safe for the vessel to proceed to a repair port in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>While I am assured that the safety of passengers on board the vessel was not endangered during either incident and that the response to both has been handled professionally by the company and the marine survey office, I am nevertheless concerned that the incidents occurred. It is my objective, in partnership with the company and the regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom where the vessel is registered, to ensure any lessons to be learned are implemented with a view to preventing a recurrence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Within a space of two months the ferry hit a specially designed fender and there was a fire on board when it was 20 minutes off Dun Laoghaire. While inquiries have been <Col N="1169" /> initiated, incidents such as these diminish public confidence in the operation of ferries. There is a need for reassurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the public is reassured. That is the reason I ordered immediate investigations. We are in communication with the company in connection with both incidents. The accidents were unusual. The fire was well contained and action was taken swiftly. The normal procedures were followed. Everything that should have been done was done. The vessel was held until we were satisfied that it was safe for it to sail again. In the second incident, the vessel was damaged when it hit a mooring dolphin in strong winds. This was unexpected but the lessons have been learned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I congratulate Deputy Coveney on his election. Is the Minister satisfied that the training provided by companies and local authorities is adequate to allow staff cope with fires on passenger and commercial vessels in harbours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In both incidents normal procedures were followed. While regular training courses are provided by ferry operators, I accept the Deputy's point that it is important that staff have the competence to cope, given the large numbers of passengers now being carried.  I will renew my warnings. The Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, has recently reached agreement with the fire service that specially trained fire fighters may be brought on board by helicopter. If the vessel in question had been farther out, they would have been flown in immediately.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>and Natural Resources the measures, if any, in his Department to reach the 20 per cent broadleaf planting target in view of the fact that only 3 per cent of the land that Coillte afforests is planted with broadleaves and broadleaves are not planted under Coillte's farm forestry partnership scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12415/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategic plan for the forestry sector, Growing for the Future, sets out an annual target of 20 per cent for broadleaf planting. This target has been met on average over the past three years. This compares with annual broadleaf planting of 2 per cent to 3 per cent in the mid-1980s. Grants and premiums under the afforestation scheme are and will continue to be heavily biased in favour of broadleaves. Under the Coillte farm partnership scheme, which accounts for approximately 40 per cent of coillte planting, the level of broadleaves is10 per cent. The level of broadleaves for the balance of Coillte planting is approximately 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> Quality of land is crucial in dictating the opportunity for diversity of species. Many broadleaved species are demanding of land quality while conifer species are more productive on poorer soils. I understand from Coillte that the land becoming available to the company does not, as a rule, lend itself to broadleaf planting.</P>
    <P>The emphasis is on increasing the diversity of species planted which will enhance the environment and broaden downstream timber processing activities and protect forest health. I am particularly anxious to see a reintroduction of native hardwoods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Will he consult with the Heritage Council on this matter as it has very different views and a different understanding of what the document, Growing for the Future, entails? Will the Minister of State address the concerns it raises as regards the lack of monitoring of sites of architectural or conservation value and the risks to certain rivers and lakes from largescale afforestation? Does he accept it will be difficult to realise the 20 per cent target unless planting on good land is encouraged? Will he take that into account in the Coillte farm forestry partnership scheme? Is the Minister aware of the Heritage Council's view that the target for broadleaf planting should be 50 per cent rather than 20 per cent? It has highlighted the value added timber processing facilities and the empowerment of local communities brought about by a greater enthusiasm for broadleaf planting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time I discuss with the Heritage Council its views. Indeed, I discuss the views of many organisations involved in the timber industry. It is up to me to strike a balance, and the balance which is being struck is a reasonable one. I am satisfied the target as set is being achieved, and there may even be a bias towards the broadleaves. Like the Deputy, I have a particular interest in the environment. It might be no harm to say that conifers remove 100 turns of carbon from the atmosphere per hectare, which is far more than broadleaves, and they are, therefore, more efficient in combating the greenhouse effect. I am, however, very conscious of what the Deputy said and it is my intention to maintain the balance at 20 per cent at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does Ireland stand given that in the EU an average of 60 per cent of trees planted are broadleaves? Does he believe Ireland is not as good a country in which to grow trees as other European countries? Is he prepared to strike the balance set in Europe where broadleaves are a much greater feature of the economy and the landscape than in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, it is very difficult to convince the Irish farmer to allow planting on good land. It is my intention to achieve the targets set out in the strategic plan <Col N="1171" /> but I must admit it is very difficult. At the moment farmers are inclined to make poorer quality land available for afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to encourage anyone to plant broadleaves where they might not survive, and I am sure that would not be the view of the Deputy. I hope more good land will become available. Forestry and afforestation are very good alternatives for farmers to consider. Conifers will survive on poorer type soils whereas broadleaves will not. In the interests of the taxpayer and, indeed, the environment, I will not encourage the planting of broadleaves where such a plantation would not survive.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources the contribution which Irish farmed salmon makes to the export economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As a significant component of both the Irish aquaculture and fish processing industries, farmed salmon will continue to make an increasingly important and growing contribution to Irish seafood exports currently valued at some £250 million per annum. The Irish farmed salmon industry is now producing over 15,000 tonnes per annum currently valued at £40 million. Some 75 per cent of production is exported to international markets in primary and value added form. While Irish farmed salmon production volume is still very modest by comparison with the major competitors, Scotland and Norway, it is recognised in the key overseas markets as a premium quality product.</P>
      <P>From modest beginnings in the early 1980s, the Irish aquaculture industry, of which the salmon sector is the major component, has grown significantly in recent years. The value of the aquaculture sector to the economy has almost quadrupled in the past ten years to £60 million, which is largely export driven. Aquaculture also contributes over 25 per cent of raw material supply to the seafood processing sector. This development has been underpinned by national and EU funding support which has served as a catalyst for the growth of Irish farmed salmon production. Since 1994 alone under the current Operational Programme for Fisheries over £7 million has been invested in the development and modernisation of farmed salmon facilities around our coastline. This investment strategy has been fully backed by BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta. The new aquaculture licensing framework which is now in place will also underpin and facilitate further sustainable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish farmed salmon is already a recognised quality product with a competitive edge in the <Col N="1172" /> marketplace and we must now build on the potential for further sustainable expansion of the sector. BIM Seafood Industry Agenda 2000-2006, together with the IFA's strategy for aquaculture investment post 2000, underlines the challenges and opportunities for the sector in the medium term and proposes an investment programme to support ambitious but realisable targets for aquaculture output and value. I will work to deliver the necessary investment support for the aquaculture industry under the next national plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Does he agree this is possibly one of the most exciting areas of development, not only in financial terms but also in employment terms? What is his opinion on the possibility that we might outstrip Norway and Scotland in this regard in view of the fact we have the natural facilities available to us to? What is his view on the development exports in farm grown salmon over the next ten years or so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the farmed salmon industry is exciting and I intend to continue to promote it. Many jobs are created in this industry in remote rural areas where jobs would not otherwise be created. We need to consider moving towards the development of added value. This is ongoing and substantial grants have been made available to various people interested in this area. Licensing is also an important part of this industry and we are progressing well with the issue of licences. I assure the House we will continue to do so on the basis that this is an industry with tremendous growth possibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing and I intend to bring them to a conclusion as soon as possible in the interests of the industry. I thank Deputy Sargent for raising this issue.

The focus is on quality rather than quantity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My overall objective is to encourage and support sustainable development of the aquaculture industry which is playing a valuable <Col N="1173" /> role in the provision of jobs and economic activity in coastal areas. There are now more than 3,000 people employed in the sector and aquaculture production is worth more than £60 million per year.</P>
      <P>Salmon farming alone accounts for some 900 jobs, with annual production of 15,500 tonnes valued at £40 million, and is an increasingly important supplier of raw material to the processing sector. So far this year 15 licences have been granted for salmon farming projects. Positive decisions to license have been made for a further eight projects. Six of these decisions have been appealed to the independent statutory Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board and the remaining two are awaiting the expiry of the statutory one month period allowed to make an appeal to the board.</P>
      <P>Many of the currently licensed salmon farms have plans for major expansion requiring new aquaculture licences. All of those expansion proposals must be carefully considered under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, and in particular must undergo the full consultation process, including the publication of an environmental impact statement. My Department is committed to processing these applications to decision as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with some of the points made by the Minister. The Minister and I dealt with the Act in 1997 while he was Whip of the Committee and I was Chairman and both of us are, therefore, fairly familiar with it. At that time the Minister correctly referred to the delays in the Department due to lack of resources and staff in the processing of these applications. I agreed with the Minister at that time. Now that the Minister is in the driving seat, what proposals has he or what steps has he taken to deal with that problem? Does he agree that the general consensus in the House is that the lack of resources creates problems and results in delays in applications for licences?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the concerns of many people in terms of the difficulties we have had regarding licensing. I do not agree that this has been solely due to the lack of staff. As the Deputy is aware, this was a long and protracted exercise which necessitated the introduction of an amendment to the legislation before Christmas. I again thank Fine Gael and the Labour Party for assisting and facilitating me in putting through that amendment which allowed licensing to commence. Licensing only commenced at the beginning of 1999 when there were 600 applications. I am pleased to say we have dealt with approximately 135 of those applications and we continue to deal with the others. We are very careful to ensure that all stipulations in the Act are followed in the provision and consideration of licences. I am sure the Deputy agrees that this is the way to move forward. My intention is to have the backlog dealt with by the end of 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the proposal to set up a new maritime college at Ringaskiddy, County Cork, was a key recommendation of the taskforce on seafarer training and employment which I established in February 1998. In its final report presented to me in October 1998, the taskforce stressed that more detailed costings would be necessary before the national maritime college development could proceed.</P>
      <P>Government approval in principle to the development of the new national maritime college for Cork, announced in October 1998, was further underpinned by the allocation of £200,000 to my Department to advance work on the costings and scheduling for the new college. To progress the recommendations of the taskforce an interdepartmental expert working group has been established. The group comprises senior officials and technical experts from my Department, the Departments of Finance, Education and Science and Defence, as well as representatives of the Cork Institute of Technology, the Naval Service and FÁS. The group is currently examining the costings, financing and timing of the new national maritime college with a view to submitting to Government a fully developed proposal for implementation</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the group's work be progressed as quickly as possible so that the Government approval in principle can be given tangible effect in terms of an implementation plan and timeframe. I hope the group will be able to finalise its work by July 1999.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response, but it is eight months since the by-election campaign when the Government announced in very large headlines that it would launch a national maritime college in Ringaskiddy in Cork. The Minister mentioned a large number of groups which are waiting for news of the college. I am glad we will hear some news in July but I urge the Minister to ensure the project is iniated quickly. He will be aware that, particularly in the Navy, there is a severe morale problem and a development such as this would give it and Cork Institute of Technology a large boost. If progress is not made I will again raise this matter following the summer recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The large headlines were not my doing &ndash;<i>The Examiner</i> gave very good coverage to this excellent proposal. The reason it moved so quickly was that the taskforce did a good job in its development of the proposal. I immediately <Col N="1175" /> felt the report presented to me was a very good national proposal and the Government accepted and backed it. The next step was to prepare the detailed costings and to bring together the different groups which had co-operated up to that time to implement the proposals. This is what has happened and things are moving quite quickly for a project of this nature. A firm of consultant engineers has been commissioned to seek tenders to carry out site investigation work on a proposed site owned by the Department of Defence in Ringaskiddy, the proposed location for the college. The group is also planning to engage consultants to help them identify potential partners for public-private partnerships to develop the college or aspects of it.</P>
      <P>Things are moving quickly and I think the target set out in their programme will be adhered to. Once it provides its report we will be in a position to set down specific targets for its implementation and for the building programme. I am sure that like me the Deputy looks forward to that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years we have been confronted with the stark realities of the abuse of children. This has been a halting process which has often placed unbearable strains on victims striving to build a new life in place of the years stolen from them by terror. With dignity and bravery they have told their stories. They have challenged our collective complacency and, as the Taoiseach said on Tuesday, they have shown us we cannot put the past behind us by ignoring it but must confront it and learn its lessons.</P>
      <P>One of the most striking things I have found in my discussions with victims is that they feel they must still fight to be believed. When I met one group of victims last week they began by saying: &ldquo;Minister, we want you to believe that these things happened to us&rdquo;. They felt this was necessary because the reality of official action had never caught up with the rhetoric of empathy. The major revelations of 1996 had brought many promises but little action and the victims came to believe they were again being ignored by a public Ireland which would prefer to ignore the uncomfortable rather than face up to it. I repeat on the record of the House what I said to those victims: &ldquo;The Government believes you; you were gravely wronged and it falls to us to do all we can to help you overcome the lasting effects of the ordeals you were put through.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The apology issued by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State and all citizens of the State was intended as a simple but fundamental demonstration that the Government is determined to throw up the shutters on the past, to learn its lessons and do all that can be done to heal its lasting wounds. This is not an issue to which the Government is providing a knee-jerk reaction. We have spent a large amount of time discussing it both informally and formally. Early last year the Taoiseach said he wanted his Government to be the one which adopted a comprehensive and appropriate response to dealing with both the effects and prevention of abuse. One-off initiatives were not to be entertained and an interdepartmental approach was to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last December a sub-committee of the Cabinet was established with the remit of drawing together a range of initiatives and developing a proposal to establish a commission into abuse. I was appointed chairperson of the sub-committee, which includes the Tánaiste, the Attorney General and five other members. Contrary to statements made by certain Deputies last week, we were not driven by a concern to find legal ways out of taking action. Our purpose is to find a means of moving away from the conservative approach which informed previous responses to revelations. The sub-committee, assisted in its <Col N="1177" /> work by a group of senior officials, primarily met informally and required significant bilateral contact between members. It considered international practice and a range of different aspects to past and present instances of abuse, including how abuse cases should be handled in the future. Our recommendations were accepted by Cabinet on Tuesday and announced that evening. We would not suggest the proposals are in any way a final response to all issues of child abuse, and it is clear further measures will be required, but they represent a major move forward.</P>
    <P>The need for a forum for victims to tell their stories has been clear for some time. Added to this is the need to objectively examine the causes, nature and extent of abuse. It is intended that the commission the Government has decided to establish will fulfil these roles. In the interests of justice and the common good, this unusual move is not only justified but essential. As announced, it will consist of three persons. It is intended they will combine expertise in law, abuse and social services. A secretariat will be provided for the commission and such resources as it requires for additional assistance, including the extensive research which will obviously be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to adopt an unusual process for the establishment of the commission because we want to make sure both its powers and operational details are what are required to meet its objectives. We envisage these will deal with matters such as privilege and compellability. We are establishing it on an administrative basis in the first instance. It will be asked to return to Government within three months with recommendations on such statutory powers as it may feel are required to underpin its work. We will then seek to enact the necessary legislation without delay. We welcome the support of the Opposition for this approach and its assurance that the legislation will receive priority treatment in the House. We want the commission to carry out its work without fear or favour and to go wherever it feels it must go to get at the truth. We want it to inspire the confidence of victims and for all individuals and bodies to co-operate fully with it.</P>
    <P>The commission has not been set an easy task. It will be a unique body, different from anything else we have seen. The narrow legal and adversarial approaches which can so often be part of inquiries should play no role in its work as they would undermine its purpose. If the establishment of the commission is itself a statement about the need for us to mature as a nation, its operation will be another challenge to us. Can we approach it in good faith and openness, use it to confront issues long buried and proceed with this process in a dignified manner? For politicians it also poses the question of whether we can have confidence in it and give it the space to do its work without us seeking to interfere or grandstand.</P>
    <P>The commission does not represent business as usual and the more we appreciate this and give it <Col N="1178" /> the support it needs the more likely it is to achieve its objectives. It is not about money, headlines or short-term gain, but about a search for the truth, an opening up to people who have suffered in silence for too long and a statement about what we want to be in the future. In many ways I agree with the suggestion that it is similar to the Truth Commission which operated in South Africa, with the obvious exception that we do not propose to offer an amnesty from criminal prosecution. Coming at the end of a century which has seen many developments in this country, I hope and believe the commission will be remembered as making a lasting and positive impression on our progress as an inclusive society.</P>
    <P>It is well known that victims of abuse generally require counselling to help them to overcome its effects. I have heard many stories from victims of the difficulties they have faced in accessing counselling. In many cases victims have shouldered much of the burden for counselling due to the inadequacies of available services. In one case that has been brought to my attention, a victim was asked to attend counselling in the very building in which they were abused.</P>
    <P>Victims have also been required to spend significant sums on getting to and from counselling. Each time the spotlight has shone on abuse, promises have been made about counselling but each time nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to deal with this by establishing a dedicated professional counselling service in all regions. Some £4 million per annum has been allocated for the service. Deputies will appreciate that, because of issues relating to the availability of staff, the new service will take time to get going. In the meantime, alternative arrangements are being worked on and we hope they will be announced by the Department of Health and Children within a fortnight. We will also ensure there is co-ordination between health boards on the implementation of best practice, and specific steps will be taken to promote widespread knowledge of the availability of services.</P>
    <P>The issue of the applicability of the Statute of Limitations to cases of childhood abuse is extremely complex. Regarding sexual abuse, there is a body of international and domestic experience which can be drawn upon to guide legal changes. Evidentiary and related issues have been examined and it is reasonably clear what action is required. As announced by the Taoiseach, the Government has agreed to support the amendment of the statute to extend the concept of disability to victims of childhood sexual abuse who, because of that abuse, have been unable to bring claims within the normal limitation period.</P>
    <P>We do not believe similar guidance is available in other cases and have decided to ask the Law Reform Commission for its recommendations. If, however, there is guidance which Deputies feel we have missed, such as the handling of the evidence of the effects of abuse and the operation <Col N="1179" /> of such cases in other jurisdictions, we would welcome this. The House will consider this issue in full and it will be dealt with by the end of this session. These are serious issues and I hope we can discuss them seriously, without attempts at oneupmanship and without the type of adversarial exchanges which are too often a part of our business.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the other details of the Taoiseach's announcement on Tuesday. These reiterate and develop our policy on the protection of children. We will have a number of opportunities to discuss these in the House so I do not propose to go into them further here. Significant progress is being made and, while there is clearly much left to be done, the proposals under way will make a major contribution.</P>
    <P>Over the past three weeks RTE screened a series of programmes on the abuse of children in residential institutions. Much of the material is harrowing and has had a major impact on everyone who has seen it. I acknowledge the incredible work of Mary Raftery and her production team for the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; series. They have performed a major public service and have shown us all the compelling power of top quality documentary work.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; has provided an immediate context for today's debate, as have associated articles concerning the 1970 Kennedy report on reformatory and industrial schools. I have spent some time examining papers on this topic. Yesterday I met the surviving members of the Kennedy committee to discuss their work and I want to give the House some flavour of what I have found.</P>
    <P>The residential care of children was formalised throughout the 19th century. Institutions were certified to receive children who were either committed or sentenced. Following the closure of the last certified school under Protestant management in 1917, every school was run by a religious order. At the turn of the century there were 71 such schools on the island, with a total of approximately 8,000 children. By 1970, there were 29 schools in this jurisdiction catering for some 2,000 children. The significant majority of children in the schools were there due to their guardians being deemed to be unfit.</P>
    <P>This decline in numbers was the result of a wide range of factors, but, as has been pointed out, this country clearly differed from others in both the relative and absolute numbers of children committed to residential care. The patterns of neglect and abuse which have been publicised are clearly evident in the surviving evidence, both archival and oral. There is simply no doubt that these institutions were not only deficient, they witnessed serious levels of the direct sexual and physical abuse of children.</P>
    <P>In 1968, the then Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, decided to do something about them. The mechanism he chose was the establishment of a committee chaired by District Justice <Col N="1180" /> Eileen Kennedy. It had 11 members, quite a number of whom were remarkably young, something which seems to have been a deliberate move on the part of the Government. One of the members told me that Donogh O'Malley said of the schools, in his typically direct way, &ldquo;I want the skin pulled off this pudding&rdquo;. Unfortunately, he died soon after the committee was established.</P>
    <P>They viewed their work as future-focused. They knew the system was rotten and concentrated on ways in which it could be replaced: this was particularly done in light of assurances they received that it was policy to close the Letterfrack, Daingean and Glasnevin institutions. They held 69 meetings and carried out an extensive amount of research, including into the operation of systems in other countries. Their policy on visiting the schools has been described to me by members of the committee as of being based on familiarisation rather than inspection. They collectively visited the bigger institutions and visited the others in small groups. While they wrote reports on the institutions, they did not comprise detailed observations, rather they included general impressions.</P>
    <P>In their work, they received little assistance. The behaviour of many managers and officials has been described to me as, at best, silently obstructive. It was only due to the direct intervention of the then new Minister, Brian Lenihan, that the committee was given a proper secretariat. There was an always present sense that their operations represented the end of the way that things had always been.</P>
    <P>As has been reported, the working files of the committee appear to be missing. My Department retains in the region of 46,000 files and records regarding the old industrial and reformatory schools. The files and records in question go back as far as the last century and their content varies very significantly in terms of detail. In recent years professional archivists have compiled a database of the files on behalf of the Department. Their work was completed last year. These files are made available for inspection by researchers with two obvious exceptions, namely, files involving the personal details of named children and files relating to current Garda investigations. Full access and assistance was given by my officials to the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; researchers.</P>
    <P>My Department also has a significant number of files dealing with policy issues relating to the operation of the industrial and reformatory school system. These files deal with a range of matters relating to the general operation of the facilities, including issues relating to funding, staffing and inspection.</P>
    <P>The files in question include a number which relate specifically to the establishment of the Kennedy committee, the outcome of that committee's work and the action taken to give effect to the committee's recommendations. A number of additional files have been identified which deal with matters relating to child care issues and <Col N="1181" /> which would have been relevant to the work of the Kennedy committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to the working files of the committee, the House will appreciate that prior to the introduction of the National Archives Act, 1986, and during the period now under discussion, practices relating to the keeping of files and records were not as well developed as they are today.</P>
    <P>I first want to establish whether such files still exist within the system and the archives. I can assure the House that in the event of any such files being located, it is my intention that their content be placed in the public domain to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to appoint a professional researcher to draw from the Department's archives all files which would assist the commission or us in identifying the Kennedy committee's working flies, should they exist.</P>
    <P>My officials have identified details of the only significant occasion on which the committee seems to have confronted the abuse of children. It is worthwhile for me to outline the details of this to the House.</P>
    <P>On 28 February 1968 most of the members of the committee visited Daingean reformatory school. There impression of it was of a dismal place which should be closed as soon as possible. In the course of their discussions with the manager he was asked about the corporal punishment procedures. According to the account on file, &ldquo;He replied openly and without embarrassment that ordinarily the boys were called out of the dormitories after they had retired and that they were punished on one of the stairway landings.&rdquo;  The manager was asked if the boys were stripped and he replied that at times they were. &ldquo;Some other committee member asked why he allowed boys to be stripped naked for punishment and he replied, in a matter of fact manner, that he considered punishment to be more humiliating when it was administered in that way.&rdquo;  That is a direct extract from the file.</P>
    <P>District Justice Kennedy wrote to the Department of Education on this and other matters and received a reply which dealt with everything but the punishment. While giving assurances about the closure of Daingean, assurance about the punishments stopping seem only to have been given as a result of significant disputes, the exact details of which do not seem to be documented. The exception to this is an April 1970 letter from the Secretary of the then Department of Justice to the Secretary of the then Department of Education. The Secretary of the then Department of Justice wrote that the official of his Department who was a member of the committee had signed the report on the basis of assurances which their Department had received that the Daingean punishments would be stopped. He wrote:</P>
    <P>To sign a report which made no reference to the situation about punishment in Daingean would, in the absence of evidence that the practice had ceased, be to appear to acquiesce in a practice which is indefensible and for the con<Col N="1182" /> tinuance of which the Minister for  Justice could not avoid some official responsibility arising out of his having registered Daingean as a suitable place of detention under the Children Acts.</P>
    <P>His next comment reveals much about the approach to abuse even of concerned people:</P>
    <P>On the other hand, to make any reference, however oblique, to this particular method of punishment in Daingean would be likely to lead to a disclosure of the situation and, in this way, to cause a grave public scandal.</P>
    <P>This episode demonstrates, I believe, the need for everything to come out in the open. I have no doubt that there are many other such incidents in official records and that official neglect and ignorance was commonplace.</P>
    <P>Rather than labouring our debate on the issue of the whereabouts of the Kennedy committee working files, it would be best to say that, while the members of the committee believe that they do not contain great detail relating to instances of abuse, they appear to be illustrative of the practice in at least one institution. In other words, that case in Daingean was highlighted. In most of the other institutions these were visits of familiarisation and they did not identify abuse issues. This said, however, if the files can be found, they will be found and they will be made publicly available.</P>
    <P>The committee also detailed the manner in which the system was failing in just about every aspect of child care. For example, they showed that only four out of 41 personnel with child care responsibilities had any form of professional training in the area and the children received little or no education provision.</P>
    <P>The issue of the impact of State funding on what happened in the institutions has been aired a great deal in recent weeks. This is obviously an area which the commission will examine in depth, but I want to make a few comments. The bottom line is that funding levels provide no excuse for the type of severe physical and sexual abuse which has been exposed. I am not suggesting that funding was what it should have been &ndash; indeed it was clearly deficient &ndash; but I think proper research would be required before we could accept as unarguable that the worst conditions experienced in the schools, particularly in terms of malnutrition, resulted from funding problems. One file I have seen from the 1940s showed a manager being removed from a school because of the malnutrition of the children and that the situation subsequently improved.</P>
    <P>The report of the Kennedy Committee was wide-ranging and, I believe, visionary. It contained a large number of recommendations, some of which are only now being implemented. The more significant recommendations were acted upon and led to the end of the system as it then was. Group homes now form the basis of most care and the professionalisation of staff has been implemented. One of the report's lesser noticed <Col N="1183" /> recommendations called for an overhaul of school attendance legislation to include the employment of school welfare officers. Deputies will be aware that the Education Welfare Bill, which the Government recently published, acts in this spirit and overturns the enforcement-led approach so often evident in the past.</P>
    <P>The concept of the child as a separate individual with rights came late to this country. For generations, many of our most vulnerable citizens suffered terribly when they had the right to expect support and protection. The system failed them, we all failed them and have continued to fail them by our inaction and neglect.</P>
    <P>The preface of the Kennedy Report was short and specifically designed to say that things had to change:</P>
    <P>Children need love, care and security if they are to develop into full and mature persons. For most children this is provided by a warm, intimate and continuous relationship with their parents, brothers and sisters. Children in institutions have for the most part missed this happy relationship. If they are to overcome this deprivation they must, therefore, be given love, affection and security by those in whose care they are placed.</P>
    <P>I hope we can use our discussions positively and can suspend our normal approach to issues and demonstrate a common purpose. Throughout the work of the commission, and probably well beyond it, further horrific cases of abuse will come to light. More and more difficult questions will be asked and our concept of our society will be challenged. If we try, we can make this a healing process which will bring us closer to maturing as a society. If we achieve this, then hopefully we will have done much to mature as an inclusive, responsive and caring community.</P>

      <P>If the stream of child abuse cases had dulled our sensitivity to the horror of this crime, the personal stories revealed in &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; have certainly reawakened our jaded conscience. In the television programmes, we saw systematic abuse meted out to children in need by those trusted with their care. These children had nowhere else to turn, no home to which they could retreat and no ear to listen to their stories. Their betrayal is very painful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have the age-old parable acted out in real life; children setting out on a lonely journey, being set upon savagely and scarred for life. One by one, those in authority walk by on the other side averting their eyes. Doubtless, each of them could have offered explanations as to why he or she was not the one to heed the cries of anguish. <Col N="1184" /> How hollow would such explanations ring when compared with real life stories, stories of childhoods brutalised, adolescences consumed with anger and frustration and stories of spirits twisted and broken?</P>
    <P>There are no heroes in this story aside from those who have endured so much pain and grief and have survived through sheer tenacity. Even now, they are willing to tell their stories in order that others will not suffer the same fate. As their stories have started to seep out, how often have they been belittled, denied or branded as deranged? To be a victim is bad enough, to be denied is devastating.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke for all of us when he offered a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, detect their pain and come to their rescue. We must remember that an apology is only the start in the process of making amends. We must learn from what has happened. The apology must be accompanied by sustained action, long after the memory of these vivid programmes have faded from the public mind. We will not learn if this process merely leads to finger pointing at people and practices from the past. Many good people seem to have been trapped in an environment where loyalty, fear of scandal or legal convention blinded them to their responsibilities. The environment of &ldquo;you do not want to ask&rdquo; is not gone. Industrial schools may be closed but wherever children are in the custodial care of people who have complete authority over them, this could happen again.</P>
    <P>This issue is not about raking over the past for its own sake. The past is still with the victims. This legacy can only be overcome if the entire community listens with an open heart and starts the healing process. We must ensure that in future we have people whose job it will be to listen to the cries of anguish, people who will ask the awkward questions and will not let known offenders slip quietly into the woodwork only to reappear elsewhere to continue their activities.</P>
    <P>We must put in place a more robust legal framework to deal with children who are at risk of being neglected or abused. There must be three pillars to this framework. First, a clear legal right must be established for any child with special needs to have that need assessed, a clear statement issued on the resources required to meet the need and an obligation placed on the State and its agencies to make all reasonable effort to provide necessary supports. Second, an inspectorate must be established for all child care providers which will have sufficient independence, powers and resources to do its job properly. Third, an ombudsman for children should be appointed who would listen to complaints and act upon them. He or she should have the power to intervene to investigate suspected malpractice without notice.</P>
    <P>Even after the Government's announcement, we are still a long way from having such a framework in place. While it would be churlish not to <Col N="1185" /> welcome the Government's announcement, it is our job to place its proposals under critical scrutiny. The announcement bears the marks of a rushed job; the terms of reference provide an opportunity for stories to be told and ask the commission to establish the causes, nature and extent of physical and sexual abuse in institutions. However, no mention is made of an assessment of the State's role in resourcing, supervising and inspecting these institutions. This must also be examined.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House has become sadly familiar with inquiries which raise crucial issues such as the compellability of witnesses, the right to legal representation for any person whose reputation might be damaged, requests for immunity for certain witnesses, the privilege of witnesses from prosecution for defamation and the right to compensation for persons who have suffered. All of these issues raise important political questions; they are not simply technical matters which can be tossed to the three person commission. The Government should have a view on these matters and should clarify them. For example, will witnesses who come forward to tell their stories face hostile cross-examination by teams of lawyers paid by the State representing those who stand accused of neglect or abuse? Will the evidence deduced in the inquiry be admissible in any subsequent criminal prosecution? </P>
    <P>These are important matters and the Government must do more than inform the commission to come up with a formula. While I welcome the right of any commission of inquiry to return to the House seeking additional powers, the Government should, with the resources available to the committee comprising the Attorney General and several Ministers, have been in a position to come up with better guidelines for the commission than we have seen to date.</P>
    <P>While the Government's decision to lift the three year limitation on personal injury claims for sexual abuse is welcome, it is impossible to understand why this does not also extend to cases of severe physical abuse. The Minister cited long established practice in relation to sexual abuse. I do not believe the concession we are seeking for those who have suffered sustained physical abuse will open the floodgates, which I assume is the basis for the Minister's concern. It is only if a person proves they were unable to come forward earlier because of the effects of the severe physical abuse they suffered that the three year limit will be lifted under the proposals. I cannot see a sound basis for the distinction which the Minister and the Government have drawn between the two cases.</P>
    <P>The extension of child care provisions to centres for children with physical and mental disabilities is welcome. We are still a far cry from having a well resourced inspectorate with statutory independence in a position to uphold standards in all institutions run by the State or by voluntary bodies. I understand that there is no proper statutory provision for some of the inspec<Col N="1186" /> tions and different bodies carry out different inspections. We need a unified inspectorate with proper resources.</P>
    <P>The publication of findings from previous inquiries is rightly being re-examined. At the time of the Madonna House inquiry, the Department had no statutory basis for the initiation of its own inquiry. Instead, it was reliant on the order and the health board commissioning an inquiry. As a result, the Department and the Government of the day was constrained significantly in what it could do with the report. Is the Department is still similarly constrained in conducting independent inquiries and publishing findings on similar cases should they arise?</P>
    <P>It is understandable that sections of that report were not published because they might have prejudiced subsequent criminal trials. In many areas of public life, however, legal advice founded on the fear of litigation has resulted in excessive secrecy. The validity of these legal arguments must be put under fresh scrutiny as part of the process now being undertaken. There is a strong public interest that any policy weaknesses uncovered by such inquiries be exposed, understood and corrected.</P>
    <P>As the Minister requested, this side of the House will conduct the debate on the basis of trying to secure the best outcome for a sad legacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate RTE for its exposure of the brutal and sadistic cruelty visited on the most vulnerable children in our society under the supervision of State institutions. I welcome the acknowledgement by the State of its role in the severe damage caused to many children and I welcome the apology the Taoiseach made on behalf of the State. To apologise fully, the full facts surrounding the level of abuse and the culpability for that abuse must be established. The Minister has come to the House to outline the process for doing this.</P>
      <P>Why should children who fell on hard times be battered, brutalised, dehumanised and made victims of sexual abuse? Their only crime was to be poor. These people will now have their stories heard and their suffering understood. They must receive a compassionate response from the State. We must ensure that what happened does not occur again. It can occur and we must ensure that this generation of legislators is not found culpable of failing to act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child abuse continues today and its levels are increasing, but there is a high level of legislative neglect. During the period September to December 1998, there were approximately 100 incidences reported to the Garda of suspicious approaches made to children, but the Government has not yet introduced a register of sex offenders. We need a children's ombudsman, established on a statutory basis to promote and protect children's rights. Children have a right to feel safe, not to be brutalised and dehumanised. They have a right not to suffer from sexual abuse. They have the right to be treated with the same <Col N="1187" /> respect and dignity as every human being. A children's ombudsman would ensure these aims were adhered to as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland ratified without reservation on 21 September 1992, accepting its international obligations towards children, states that all signatories shall undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the rights accordingly. Given that Ireland ratified the convention, the Government is obliged to take steps to ensure compliance with the provision to protect and promote children's rights. A children's ombudsman must be a priority.</P>
    <P>Many children live in considerable disadvantage &ndash; children in care, children in legal custody, children who are subject to abuse and neglect, homeless children and children with disabilities. The Government should establish a children's ombudsman as an overall mechanism for the promotion of children's rights.</P>
    <P>We can look at the past, apologise for it and compensate for it, but what happened cannot be undone. We must recognise what happened but we must ensure that it does not happen again in any guise, institutional or otherwise. This is our duty as legislators.</P>
    <P>At its first general meeting in March 1995, the Children's Rights Alliance decided that one of its main concerns would be the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children which it felt would play a significant role in implementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child and ensuring that children's rights were protected. Following examination of the first report on the implementation of the convention, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern about the lack of an independent monitoring mechanism such as an ombudsman or a child's rights commissioner, accessible to children, for dealing with complaints or violations of rights and to provide remedies of such violation. The committee recommended that the Government should consider positively the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children to further the implementation of the convention in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Public discourse with children has been minimalist in nature. This is shown by the presence of all the principal players in education at the 1994 National Education Convention with the notable exception of children. The Constitution Review Group, CARI, the Kilkenny incest investigation and the report of the 1995 Kelly Enquiry have all stated that the strong emphasis of the family in the Constitution may, consciously or unconsciously, be interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents than of children. The constitutional clarification of children's rights would assist in the creation of a positive environment for a statutory office of an ombudsman for children. Consequently, a specific, overt declaration on the rights of children should be inserted into the Con<Col N="1188" /> stitution. This would involve the amendment of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>An ombudsman for children should be allowed to monitor child protection standards, to promote examples of good practice and to inquire into serious failures of practice. It is essential that the ombudsman would be able to take legal action in the event of a public body acting in serious breach of its obligations to children. The children's ombudsman, however, should not become involved in legal proceedings until internal complaints or appeals systems have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>In establishing such an ombudsman, the Government would recognise children's fundamental, political, social, economic and civil rights not yet enshrined in legislation. The ombudsman would be a neutral investigator of children's legitimate problems and complaints. With the freedom, authority and autonomy of the office, the ombudsman should tell it like it is and ought to be and provide a responsive forum for children's grievances. It should ensure that children are perceived as autonomous with their own special needs and rights.</P>
    <P>By establishing an office of an ombudsman for children, the State will provide a significant institutional medium through which children and young people can be heard and given a conflict free environment during their formative years from birth to voting age. The children's ombudsman should speak for children in the context of Government services, facilitating and accommodating remedies for wrongs inflicted on children. A children's ombudsman would lead the way towards ensuring that what was experienced by the brutalised and dehumanised children in institutions, as outlined in the &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programme on RTE, would never happen again. If the ombudsman for children is to genuinely promote children's rights, the office must engage in meaningful dialogue with children. This could be facilitated through the use of representative surveys or free hotlines as used by the Norwegian and Swedish ombudsman's office.</P>
    <P>I envisage a children's ombudsman playing an active role in shaping and influencing public opinion, primarily through the dissemination of opinions in the media. Alternatively, the ombudsman could lobby for amendments to legislation such as the recognition of children's needs in environmental planning.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman for children should also act in a consultative capacity in the drafting of legislation by issuing legal advice and information at the request of public bodies. He or she should be able to request Government permission to take initiatives on issues pertaining to children's rights, and the corollary is that the Government could also allocate such responsibility to the ombudsman where it sees fit. The Swedish ombudsman requested permission from the Swedish government to tackle the issue of bullying. It appears the Government has abandoned, but hopefully will now take on, the issue of an ombudsman for children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> I disagree with the development the Government announced regarding the social services inspectorate as the independence of such a body would be open to question. It is important that the ombudsman should have total independence from the Government and Government agencies.</P>
    <P>Frank Martin, lecturer in family law in UCC, wrote in the <i>Irish Journal of Family Law</i> that children are defenceless in society and should have additional protection. He stated that children are a voiceless and vulnerable minority in society and claims that Irish children have inadequate political and legal power.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive announcement by the Taoiseach yesterday in which he indicated, for the first time, that he would seriously consider the introduction of an ombudsman's office, but it must be on an independent basis.</P>

      <P>The House and the people of Ireland are indebted to Mary Raftery, and indeed to Radio Telefís Éireann, for the three &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programmes, but what is important now is that the response of the State and the public be both adequate and courageous. That will mean that certain matters will have to be faced and the truth will have to be told.</P>
      <P>There is a moral principle involved in the work of any commission such as the one that has been proposed by the Minister. That moral principle is the distinction between amnesty and amnesia when it comes to memory. For a long time we took refuge in amnesia. We chose not to remember many things that took place because they were unpleasant. That will not work. An amnesty of memory is different. It is when the person sees the perpetrator of an abuse before them and when the perpetrator admits the abuse. When that takes place, as well as the victims being able to tell their stories they may decide that they can leave aside what has happened and be prepared to move on. That has to happen and the commission, which I welcome, will not work unless what I have described takes place.</P>
      <P>In facing up to what took place, and the courage I have suggested is necessary, there is another problem, that is, pretending that many people did not know or did not accommodate themselves to what was taking place. In my constituency in Letterfrack, for example, there were boys who worked in the fields of farmers and the farmers who rang the institution and arranged for them to work in the fields know who they had in the fields with them. They know the punishments that took place in the fields. That is why the events in the three programmes prepared by Mary Raftery were not the only ones. They are the most recent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall the publication of Mannix Flynn's book, <i>Nothing to Say</i>. Mannix had been in Let<Col N="1190" /> terfrack. I also recall the difficulty he had in publishing that book and the people who did not want to review it. Mavis Arnold had difficulty also in publishing her book and having it reviewed. Many people simply would prefer that the truth never came out. They are still there. I suggest that the friends of such people will work against the commission to make sure the truth does not come out. I know people who know the people who abused them and treated them in a particular way, and they want to see them. They want to talk to them about what took place and the reason for it.</P>
    <P>There is no merit in taking refuge in old clichés such as the one that the religious orders took over something that the State neglected. In 1858, the State did not want to deal with those who went into what were reformatories. In 1868, the State did not want to deal with industrial schools. That is so but it is also inescapable that in 1898 &ndash; after 100 years we are celebrating local government &ndash; there were 71 of these schools with 8,000 children, and by the time Justice Kennedy conducted her investigation between 1967 and the report in 1970, there were 29 schools and 2,000 cases. It is necessary to state that there was, in all of the cases that have broken cover, a comprehensive abuse of power and authority, and a criminal abuse of trust.</P>
    <P>Having spent nearly 30 years as a sociologist I cannot say there is a close connection between the assumptions concerning sexuality and the body, the assumptions concerning punishment and the manner in which the State bended its knee, irrespective of what party was in power, to an unwelcome and appalling authoritarian church influence that presided over all of this. If we want to start the work of the commission, we cannot avoid that fact. It will have to be faced. How did the people come to believe that children needed to stand naked on landings at night time because punishment, humiliation and degradation worked better like that? From where did these ideas come? How much of it was owed to the Jansenist poison we have had since the end of the Famine? How do we hold these views? What damage has been done? The graduates of what I have described are in the prisons tonight. People sent by judges to remand homes and prisons this week will be raped this week. What does it tell us? These are the questions that must be addressed before we put something down on paper.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the secretary of a Department writing to another Department did not describe the impact on the child but the appalling public scandal that might be created. He described it coming into the public domain as an appalling vista that he could not handle. That is why it is necessary that every scrap of paper about everyone who was incarcerated and abused be protected and made available. Whatever about the files &ndash; we can pursue that again &ndash; I understand a survey was carried out. I also understand that a questionnaire was requested from the manager of each institution on every child. I presume <Col N="1191" /> they are all intact. That would be the raw data from which we could extract material.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the atmosphere in which this took place. That is not an excuse. There is an uncomfortable fact that we have to face up to here. In 1982, the then Minister for Education, John Boland, proposed that we stop beating children in the classroom. Some of the vested interests in education asked if we could, like decommissioning, phase it out. We did not officially abandon violence in the classroom until 1982 but that does not excuse what took place. It does not excuse the fact that when the gates closed, the principle of incarceration was an invitation to degradation and an absence of safety for some of the most vulnerable people in the State. It is horrific. In 1979 I was a member of the McBride commission and a survey was carried out of 200 prisoners. About 80 per cent of them had experienced institutions such as that at the centre of current revelations. That is why I mentioned the prisons. That is where we should start.</P>
    <P>Since these revelations came into the public domain I have been contacted by someone who has been trying to obtain information about her mother since 1992. This person has been blocked from obtaining that information. This woman was an unmarried mother who put her baby into an institution to which she paid ten shillings per week. She got pleurisy but when she regained health her baby was missing. She never found the child. The woman wrote a letter to the Sister stating:</P>
    <P>Dear Sister,</P>
    <P>Pardon me for troubling you by writing as I want to make inquiries about a child [named]. She must have been sent there from St. Patrick's Home, Dublin, sometime in July. I had been working in Dublin since the child was one year old but in March I had pleurisy and was in hospital for two months.</P>
    <P>After coming out I came home. Up to the time of writing I always saw the child twice a week and paid ten shillings a month. The next thing I heard the baby was gone. I am really heartbroken over her as I loved her beyond words. Of course my mother knows nothing about this so I could not take her home or even mention her.</P>
    <P>I do not feel well enough to go back to work. If I did I would not mind so much as I would probably be able to see her. Would it be too much of me to ask you as a favour to let me know how she is? If I sent her something would it be all right.</P>
    <P>I am enclosing a stamped addressed envelope and would it be possible to hear before Christmas? Sorry to trouble you but I just had to write.</P>
    <P>In 1976, years later, her mother died asking for her but she was never told where her mother was. Late last year, the Reverend Sisters sent her the letter I have just read, claiming that it had fallen <Col N="1192" /> from an old ledger. This is what I mean by the cunning connivance which goes on when it comes to hiding records and which will have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We will also have to face up to the connections with secret organisations which hold the view that a grave moral scandal is the truth coming out and not the abuse. They must be confronted. They made submissions to the Kennedy report and I hope they look at their records. I am not convinced by claims that there are no detailed working files. It would be extraordinary if, at the time of the written record, two people from the Department of Education would accompany the committee on its work without keeping detailed accounts. I look forward to pursuing this issue in another way.</P>
    <P>The commission will work if the perpetrators come before it. If they are not willing they must be compelled. The saddest aspect is that, coming from a time of coldness and violence in institutions, the children who needed to be hugged and touched, and still do, will not be free to be hugged and touched because of the new culture of fear which these people have given as their millennium contribution to the unborn children of the country.</P>

      <P>The conflict in Kosovo has led to the greatest mass displacement of people in Europe since the end of the Second World War. There are now up to 750,000 refugees in the region. To put this in a familiar context, this is the equivalent of the population of Connacht-Ulster being forced to move into Leinster and Munster. Such a huge movement of people has put huge strains on countries who have received the refugees, mainly Albania and Macedonia.</P>
      <P>It has also put a huge strain on the resources of the humanitarian organisations which have tried to ensure basic food supplies and medical care and some degree of shelter for the refugees. These bodies have performed heroically in the most difficult circumstances. Without their intervention many more of those who fled the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo would have died of hunger and disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are many humanitarian organisations in many countries doing great work, including Trócaire, Concern, Goal and others from Ireland, the UNHCR is the international body with primary responsibility for dealing with the plight of refugees. Its role is to protect and <Col N="1193" /> assist refugees worldwide and to try to find a solution to their plight. The UNHCR is in crisis because of the strain put on it by the scale of the exodus from Kosovo. It has spent all the cash available for the Kosovo emergency and it would be appalling if, as a result of the cash shortage, its operations in the Balkans had to be stopped or scaled down.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR has appealed for $143 million to allow it continue its operations. So far it has received only $71 million, much of which is already spent or committed. According to a list of donations published by the UNHCR on Monday, the biggest donor has been Japan which has contributed $23.1 million. Neither Ireland nor the EU appear on the list which is surprising and shameful. When I raised this matter on the Order of Business this morning, the Taoiseach said that the EU had contributed 20 million ECU this week &ndash; £15 million. This is far short of what is needed or what the EU can afford.</P>
    <P>This conflict is taking place in Europe, the wealthiest continent in the world, with Europeans being displaced and dying at the hands of other Europeans. The biggest response to the UNHCR has come from Japan. With the enormous resources at the EU's disposal, it must be possible for it to respond in a generous way to the appeal from the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>Ireland is creating record wealth and the Exchequer is awash with cash. Surely it is possible for us to respond to the UNHCR and, at least, match the contribution of $3.4 million made by Denmark and the Netherlands. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should meet our obligations by making a substantial contribution to allow the UNHCR continue its work. If a Supplementary Estimate is required the Labour Party will facilitate its immediate passage through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is also an obligation on those NATO countries pursuing the air war against Yugoslavia to match the money they are spending on the military campaign with similar resources for the humanitarian effort. The war has cost billions of dollars. No one other than the Governments involved know the exact amount. Each cruise missile costs about $1 million. The money sought by the UNHCR is the equivalent of 140 cruise missiles. That money must be found. The only way to ease the plight of the refugees permanently is through greater political and diplomatic efforts to secure a settlement to the conflict which will allow all refugees to return to their homes. The murderous attacks on Kosovar Albanians by Serb regular and irregular forces must stop.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that Slobodan Milosevic should have refused today to meet the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Mary Robinson, when she planned to meet him and present him with incontrovertible evidence of the involvement of his forces in ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Milosevic has shown once again his contempt for human rights, for civilised standards and for the United Nations. Neverthe<Col N="1194" /> less, we must redouble our efforts to bring an end to the conflict in the region and ensure the safe return home of the Kosovar Albanians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much appreciate the Deputy raising this matter. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Ogata, is very concerned that lack of funds could seriously set back efforts to assist the refugees from Kosovo. The humanitarian agencies are struggling with one of the greatest and most complex movements of people in 20th century Europe. The number of refugees and displaced people in the region is now estimated at 747,000. Conditions in the camps are not sustainable due to overcrowding, security considerations and the onset of warm weather which exacerbates water and sanitation problems.</P>
      <P>While conscious of the need to maintain and improve the existing conditions in which the refugees are living, Mrs. Ogata's fears relate in the main to the next six months when arrangements will have to be put in place to prepare the camps in the region for very harsh winter conditions or, if there is a political settlement, to return them to their homes. In either case substantial additional funding will be required to enable the UNHCR to carry out the mandate given to it by the international community to protect and take care of the refugees. The costs to adapt the camps for winter conditions are very high and way beyond the resource capacity of the UNHCR at the moment. For example, I have been told that the cost per person for the camp facilities currently in use is US $150 approximately. This could rise to US $1,000 per person for winter accommodation. The timing is crucial. Tents and clothes have to be suitable and heating equipment and fuel provided. Procurement and logistical arrangements must be made now if the camps are to be winterised before October.</P>
      <P>The UNHCR appealed for $143 million for its Kosovo operations and so far it has received $71 million. Mrs. Ogata criticised European governments in particular for not giving sufficient funding. EU member states have contributed US $15.5 million so far. In addition EU member states look to the European Community Humanitarian Office &ndash; ECHO &ndash; to make the major donation to the UNHCR on behalf of the EU.</P>
      <P>As recently as last Friday, it was decided that ECHO would make a further minimum contribution of 20 million euros to the UNHCR in addition to an earlier commitment of 3.3 million euros &ndash; a total of US £24.8 million. ECHO and the UNHCR are working hard to resolve procedural constraints holding up the transfer of these funds which will help ease the cash flow problems. There is also the strong possibility of further funding from ECHO later in the year. I intend to take up the issue of funding by the EU at the EU Development Ministers' Council on Friday of next week and to press for a more flexible approach to funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> As far as Ireland is concerned, we made a contribution of £400,000 to the UNHCR two weeks ago. Owing to an administrative error at the UNHCR our contribution was not reflected in the donor contribution charts issued. The UNHCR has apologised for our omission from the list and has now issued revised charts. This payment was part of an overall assistance package of £2.6 million agreed by the Government and channelled through the Irish non-governmental organisations, the UNHCR, the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the Irish Committee of the Red Cross. In addition we are meeting the costs of the 1,000 refugees currently on their way to Ireland &ndash; some of whom are already here &ndash; which costs are estimated to be in the region of £13 million to £14 million for a year. In that regard I have just welcomed the second group of 157 refugees to Ireland this afternoon on their way to Baltinglass and Kildare, respectively.</P>
    <P>We are equally concerned about preparations for the months ahead, particularly the winter months, and will be carrying out a needs assessment in the coming weeks. I intend to visit Macedonia to see for myself the conditions in the camps, and I can assure the Deputy that the Government is ready to continue to respond generously, including with additional contributions to the UNHCR. I will be bringing proposals to Government in this regard in the near future.</P>

      <P>We have all heard anecdotal evidence of over-zealous use of the powers available to Revenue and customs personnel. People in this House have generally taken the view that tax evasion must not only be condemned but also addressed in terms of better legislation and provision of resources. I strongly support that approach. I have often felt that the Revenue Commissioners and others were unjustly attacked on occasion in the House and in the media for failure to deal with drug barons, politicians, the so-called golden circle, beef barons, non-resident account holders and many others. On one occasion I had a complaint about the handling of a particular manner, and I accepted the explanation at the time.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the Institute of Taxation has made a strong submission and expressed certain reservations about some of the powers. The current issue of <i>Business and Finance</i> contains an article which raises serious questions. While there are codes of practice and charters of rights for taxpayers, there are many questions to be answered. The experience of one of my constituents led me to raise this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual concerned imported a car, checked the cost of clearance, could not afford it at the time because he was building a house &ndash;<Col N="1196" /> he works in a factory and is not very well paid &ndash; and his old house had not yet been sold. He left the car on private property, and he was assured that was all right. On Friday last, a caller to his place of work expressed an interest in buying the car. My constituent explained that he was not interested, and could not sell it as the duty had not been paid.</P>
    <P>He made two very serious errors in law. First, he succumbed to what I understand was severe pressure and agreed to allow the caller to see the car. Second, he allowed himself to be cajoled into moving it to a public place to have it viewed. Anybody listening to this debate will be as shocked as I am and as he was to find that when he went out on to the public road two uniformed Customs officials were lying in wait for him and the car was impounded. There is room for coincidence, but I do not believe it on this occasion, nor is it being claimed. He reached the inevitable conclusion that he had been set up and enticed or entrapped into committing the offence that was required in order to have the car taken from him.</P>
    <P>Have we in this House given such powers to these people? If we have, is this the way we intended them to be used? I suggest that it is not. This case warrants immediate action to revoke those powers if they exist, or at least to put in place an independent monitoring mechanism to deal with them.</P>
    <P>In fairness, there has been an attempt by the superiors of the gentlemen involved to address the issues. They have offered a £400 reduction in the penalty which brings it down to £200, and what could be interpreted as an apology. I have taken the view that that is a matter between the constituent and his legal adviser and the Revenue Commissioners, and it is being dealt with as such. However, the principle of the conduct of this matter and how the Revenue Commissioners deal with it is a matter for this House. I am talking about a man who has been working since he was 16 years of age, a PAYE taxpayer whose taxes were used in part to put these officers through second and third level education, opportunities which were denied to him because of circumstances at the time. He was deeply offended and shocked at the way he was treated, including having allegations made about how he could afford to build a house.</P>
    <P>In view of the evidence from a number of quarters, such as the Taxation Institute, the matter must be addressed in this House. We have ultimate responsibility for putting the legislation in place and for providing resources. There is a clear onus on us to ensure that the powers which are available are used in a manner with which we are satisfied, which is above board and does not ill-treat compliant, decent, hard working citizens in an effort to ensure that others, whose activities clearly need to be addressed, are also looked at.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that this matter is followed up, that the apology and the level of reduction that has been offered is further addressed. More fundamentally, we in this House <Col N="1197" /> should follow up on the powers we have granted and ensure that the people who have them use them in a manner with which we are happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In answering this motion on behalf of the Minister for Finance, I want first, as I have done on various other occasions, to recognise the sensitivities that are required for the exercise of Revenue powers in the matter of tax compliance and collection. This sensitivity is heightened when powers are exercised in an outfield environment, face to face with the taxpayer or citizen.</P>
      <P>Detailed procedures are set out for all Revenue officials in this area. In the case of the Revenue mobile service, great care is taken to get the balance right between the need to pursue the effective collection of tax or duties and the right of the taxpayer to fair treatment. This message is very clearly set out in the Customs and Excise Enforcement Procedures Manual in which the commissioners set out guidelines for their officers engaged in such duties. The twin principles of proper authority to exercise powers and the standard of reasonableness and professionalism in the manner of execution of these powers form the basis for action and conduct. Officers are also under a strict obligation to exercise courtesy and consideration at all times in dealings with the public.</P>
      <P>Revenue has also gone to considerable lengths to make taxpayers aware of their rights and of the avenues open to them if they have a complaint. There are a number of such avenues. First, a request for an internal review by an officer not involved in the case may be made to the Revenue Commissioners. Second, the laws pertaining to customs and excise matters, in common with other tax laws, enable taxpayers to appeal to the independent appeals commissioners on tax matters and, of course, to the courts to vindicate their rights. Third, as we are fully aware, the avenue of having cases raised in the House, by parliamentary question or otherwise, is also available. Fourth, questions of abuse of powers or maladministration can be taken up with the Ombudsman who deals with tax matters within his overall remit. Last year he dealt with 123 complaints in relation to Revenue matters.</P>
      <P>From another perspective, the manner in which Revenue conducts its business is subject to the audit scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Therefore, it can be seen that the operations of the Customs and Excise service and Revenue operations generally are subject to considerable external monitoring with strong checks and balances built into the system.</P>
      <P>The need for an effective mobile outfield service in Revenue cannot be doubted. Not all tax business can be conducted from a desk or by correspondence. In certain circumstances the situation on the ground must be assessed. An element of enforcement work inevitably involves physically policing the system and making contact with the public on site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> Since the advent of the Single Market in 1993, frontier controls have been largely removed. However, without alternative non-frontier controls, essential revenues would be exposed to serious risk and legitimate trade damaged, notably in the excise duty area which includes vehicle registration tax. There is also the need to maintain a service capable of responding to the threat of smuggled goods subject to prohibitions and restrictions, such as illegal drugs, banned animal products, counterfeit goods and pornography. This is where the Revenue mobile service has played an essential role. Since 1998 the service has taken on wider revenue duties which I will refer to later.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the Revenue Commissioners' policy of encouraging voluntary compliance, the Revenue mobile service will normally issue warnings to members of the public, rather than take immediate enforcement action such as seizure, unless the case is of such importance and nature that this approach is inappropriate. For example, in the specific area of enforcing compliance with the rules of vehicle registration tax, official procedures make specific provision for the issue of special forms serving as a warning, in advance of enforcement action, to owners or persons in charge. Last year 2,280 such forms were issued in respect of foreign registered vehicles being driven in the State. If it is found necessary on reasonable suspicion to detain a vehicle, a detention period of one month is provided by law to allow for examination, inquiries or investigations to be made for the purpose of deciding whether the vehicle is liable to forfeiture or, on the other hand, should be restored to its owner.</P>
    <P>This period affords the citizen the opportunity of producing further material or proofs that may satisfy the officer as to the regularity of the vehicle's use. The penalties attached to offences do, of course, include prosecution in the courts. However, in the majority of non-aggravated cases, the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to close the case by imposing a compromise penalty geared to the seriousness of the offence, in addition to payment of the vehicle registration tax at issue. In all cases where goods are detained by Customs and Excise, a full report of the circumstances is sent to a central office responsible for enforcement policy and these reports are carefully monitored. In 1998 over £1 million in VRT payments was received directly following the 2,280 warnings issued. A sum of £161,017 was received as penalties in relation to 584 vehicles seized, and £223,893 as additional VRT on the same seized vehicles.</P>
    <P>The strong role of the voluntary approach, based on warnings issued, is clear. It is interesting to note that in 1998, of the Revenue cases dealt with by the Ombudsman, only six related to VRT in general and only one case related to vehicle seizure. This is strong support for the view that staff employed in the Revenue mobile service do not act in an arbitrary or peremptory manner in enforcing the tax laws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> In carrying out their varied duties, RMS officers have no desire to appear confrontational, yet they must act firmly. In many instances, the customer may have ignored previous warnings or reminders issued, or persisted in failing to submit tax returns. An important part of the remit of the Revenue mobile service in new work areas is to help in obtaining tax returns and intelligence in order to assess the situation, report the facts and, if necessary, recommend a course of action.</P>
    <P>Such visits can be valuable to a taxpayer with difficulties in clearing up a messy historic tax situation. In more traditional customs and excise work areas, a more direct action may be warranted involving detention of goods. The Revenue mobile service works closely with the Customs and Excise national drugs team and has assisted in large drugs-related operations. This is very valuable work on behalf of the community.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, the establishment of any new independent monitoring mechanism for the Customs and Excise service is unnecessary. The Revenue Commissioners welcome comments and constructive criticism of their services, with a view to improving the effectiveness and standard of service, both to the general body of taxpayers and sectoral trade interests where appropriate. They are fully aware of the sensitivity attached to the exercise of enforcement powers and have informed me that where complaints are made, they are fully investigated and, if necessary, action is taken to prevent a recurrence.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that his concern will be taken into consideration by the Revenue Commissioners. For his part, the Minister for Finance is equally concerned that proper balance and judgment are exercised at all times in these areas, while recognising that even with sensitive handling, effective enforcement work will occasionally cause some tensions and accusations of unfair treatment. The Deputy has made his position in relation to a specific case very clear to the superiors of the personnel concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Health and Children for attending the House to take this matter on the Adjournment. Last Tuesday a very worrying report was launched by the organisation Children in Hospital, Ireland. The study it commissioned shows that half the children admitted to hospitals are admitted to adult wards where they are exposed to sights and sounds which can have a traumatic impact on them and the effects of which can have lasting consequences on their future wellbeing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although most of us generally assume it is accepted practice that parents are with their children during their time in hospital, extraordinarily the study shows that four hospitals will only allow parents to visit at certain times. The period immediately before and after surgery can be the most stressful time for children. At such times <Col N="1200" /> they need their parents to be with them. The study found that many hospitals actually discourage parents from being with their children at this very vulnerable time.</P>
    <P>Children in adult wards are deprived of the benefits of child and family centred care where facilities and staff are focused on their needs and where the general organisation of the hospital routine is in line with what children need, not necessarily in line with staff or adult patient requirements.</P>
    <P>We should all be grateful for the service provided by Children in Hospital, Ireland, a group that has raised the issue of addressing the needs of children in hospital. Sadly, many such children are in hospital for long periods of time and their needs for emotional support, education and recreation should be catered for. In addition, the children require other practical support, including visitors in situations where parents may be living some distance from the hospital. Very good work is being done by Children in Hospital, Ireland, and that has been added to by the research the group commissioned, which has just been published.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the political response at governmental level has been very weak. There was scant attendance by politicians at the launch of the research findings, even though many people were invited. When they got a slot on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; neither the Minister nor a representative was prepared to appear and respond to the valid issues they raised.</P>
    <P>It is now 40 years since the Platt report on the welfare of children in hospitals was published. That report suggested a framework for how children in hospital could be cared for appropriately in a manner which encompassed all their needs and which recognised the necessity for involving the family in caring for children in hospital. Central to the proposal of that report is the recommendation that children should be nursed with other children and not adults. Since the publication of that report in 1959, international and national expert opinion has steadfastly supported and endorsed that view. However, those who work with children in hospital are very concerned that their needs are not being met and the research produced by Children In Hospital, Ireland, attempts to quantify the scale of the problem.</P>
    <P>That group makes a number of recommendations to the Minister and hopes for a respond in the near future. The Minister declined to respond this week, which is one of the reasons I raised this matter on the Adjournment. There is much talk of the ill-treatment of children in the past in various institutions and we should bear in mind that our record in the treatment of children at present is not one we can be proud of. Too often the needs of children are relegated to the bottom of the agenda and we seem to take the view that children are somehow less than full citizens and therefore do not have the same rights as adults. For that reason we should pay particular atten<Col N="1201" /> tion to a group of children which is particularly vulnerable &ndash; children in hospital.</P>
    <P>I know this group has contacted the Minister. It has articulated its concerns and has sent a copy of its research to the Minister. It wants the rights of children to be cared for with other children and other adolescents to be recognised by the Minister. It wants recognised children's rights to parental and family support as well as the right to adequate facilities.</P>
    <P>The basic right of children in hospital is that they do not have to wait too long and the Minister should tackle the waiting lists. He should be prepared to go through the research commissioned by this group and to give an undertaking to address their concerns as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Children in Hospital, Ireland for preparing &ldquo;<i>Children being cared for in adult wards</i>&rdquo;, of which the Department of Health and Children received a copy yesterday. My Department supports the work carried out by this association and to that end has resourced a number of its initiatives in recent years. I have also attended some of its functions.</P>
      <P>I note from the report that Children in Hospital, Ireland, considered those up to the age of 18 as children, while I understand that the specialty of paediatrics generally refers to children up to the age of 14 or so. This would suggest that there are a considerable number of definitional issues which require clarification and I am sure the association will assist me with this matter.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are often other factors to be taken into consideration in this whole area which can be lost in a simple statistical analysis. For example, the accommodation of adolescents aged between 17 and 18 in a paediatric facility may on occasion be more inappropriate than treating this group of patients in an adult ward.</P>
      <P>I would, however, support the suggestion that in all circumstances where children have to share facilities with adults in an acute hospital setting that the hospital management should establish protocols which take account of the sensitivities and needs of all patients concerned, particularly in relation to the children.</P>
      <P>I am committed to providing acute care in an environment appropriate to the needs of all patients in line with established best practice. I am also conscious that where emergency treatment is required the provision of the treatment is the priority rather than the surroundings in which it is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> However, I would be concerned at any situation where children may be inappropriately accommodated in adult wards. I have therefore asked my officials to examine the content of the report. On completion of this examination my Department officials will discuss any issues which arise in the course of this exercise with the chief executive officers of the health boards and the chief executive officers of the major acute <Col N="1202" /> hospitals in the Dublin region. My Department officials will then be in a position to meet representatives of Children In Hospital, Ireland to discuss its report in greater detail.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Adjournment Debate. -" RHead="Social Welfare Payments">
    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Social Welfare Payments.</Title>
    <P>Mr. Broughan: The Labour Party believes that attempts by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to introduce new methods of administering social welfare payments are sloppy, poorly thought out and have resulted in huge and unnecessary distress for social welfare recipients, particularly pensioners. Two weeks ago claimants received a letter from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs outlining new plans to transfer payments directly to bank or building society accounts. Alternatively, payments might be sent directly to the claimant by cheque. The letter carried the following notice: &ldquo;It is essential that you reply by 8 May 1999 to avoid any interruption in your payment&rdquo;. That sentence in particular was highlighted by many of my constituents and by Labour representatives, who felt it caused unnecessary distress, particularly to those on disability benefit and senior citizens. They felt quite intimidated by the phrase and felt that there would be a cut in their payments and entitlements.</P>
    <P>Many welfare claimants have not ever held a bank account or building society account and this type of letter has introduced a whole new <i>modus operandi</i> and left them quite intimidated.</P>
    <P>Last Friday it emerged that the Department had issued another letter, or so it told my office, indicating that if people so wished, they could retain the option of having their payment transferred to the post office. This action was obviously only taken after the Minister discovered that the system of informing people of the new changes in social welfare administration was seriously flawed.</P>
    <P>We checked earlier today before this Adjournment debate and found that this second letter had not been sent to many parts of the country, so many social welfare recipients felt the position to be very chaotic, confused and uncertain. Sadly, this is the second major occasion on which the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has presided over a major cock-up in his Department which resulted in major distress for claimants.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children may remember that at Christmas his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs was forced to backtrack on his plans to cut the Christmas bonus. While the Labour Party generally agrees with the need to introduce greater efficiency in the payment of social welfare payments, some understanding has to be shown of the problems facing many claimants. The lack of trust which many people, particularly older people, have in our banking system must be taken into account in any attempt to have people trans<Col N="1203" /> fer payments to bank accounts and the Minister should have included the post office option from the start.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Shea said so effectively last week, and as the Minister for Health and Children will know from his constituency, the rural post office represents an important social centre for many communities. It is also the only retail financial outlet in some areas but rural post offices were badmouthed, perhaps libelled, in the Minister's circular. It infers that somehow cheques would be lost, destroyed or delayed in the post. However, the post office is not facing a committee in the same way that our largest banking group is facing the Committee of Public Accounts because of a failure to deduct the proper amount of taxation and other matters.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs' attempt to cut out the rural post offices was a retrograde step taken in a confused and chaotic way. I urge the Minister to persuade the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to admit his mistake, to send a clear circular to the 1.3 million people who depend on social welfare payments and to ensure this does not happen again.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Mr. Cowen: I have been asked by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to take this Adjournment debate. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs provides disability payments to the value of £650 million to more than 140,000 people and their dependants each year. Traditionally, these people had their claims administered in a single location and were paid by cheque.</P>
    <P>In 1992, it was decided to transfer 22,000 long duration disability benefit claims to the Longford office and to pay them by way of a payable order book. This action was taken to facilitate the development of a new computer system &ndash; the integrated short-term schemes system. It was intended that the transfer to the payable order book payment system would be temporary and that the claims would be put on the ISTS system when its development was completed.</P>
    <P>The ISTS system has been in operation for some time. Consequently, it was decided that the <Col N="1204" /> long-term disability benefit customers' claims would be transferred back to Dublin and paid on the ISTS system.</P>
    <P>The Department wrote recently to those recipients of disability benefit who are being paid by pension book &ndash; 11,700 customers &ndash; advising them of the transfer of administration of their claims from the Department's Longford office to Dublin. This transfer is being done with a view to providing better customer service and better management of the disability benefit system. Having all disability claims on the ISTS system ensures that all claims are subject to the same criteria for medical review.</P>
    <P>The ISTS system, while it does not support payment by personalised payment orders at the post office, that is book payment, offers a wide and flexible choice of payment options as follows: postdraft payable at the post office; electronic fund transfer direct to the customer's bank or building society account or to a nominated account and cheque payment to the customer's home address.</P>
    <P>Initially, as the Deputy is aware, only the electronic fund transfer and cheque options were offered to these customers. However, concerns were expressed about the loss of payment through the post office and the Minister instructed the Department to offer the option of postdraft payments to allow people claiming disability benefit to continue to collect their payments at the post office. Letters advising of this option were issued to all customers early this week.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned to ensure that disability benefit customers are treated with all possible consideration and respect. Customers can be assured that the changes which are being made will result in an improved quality of customer service.</P>

      <P>To date in 1999 two petroleum exploration licences have been granted in the Irish offshore, one to Agip Ireland BV over six blocks and the other to Elf Petroleum Ireland BV over five blocks. Both were frontier exploration licences awarded under the south porcupine round. Under these licences comprehensive licence-specific work programmes will be undertaken which will include the acquisition and processing of 2-D seismic data and the carrying out of special geophysical and geological studies where appropriate.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have granted two licensing options this year, one to Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Limited over six blocks in the Slyne Trough and the other to Enterprise Oil over one full block and four part blocks in the Donegal Basin.</P>
      <P>Despite the serious impact on the exploration and production sector of the weak oil price throughout 1998, the industry's commitment to Ireland remains good and exploration licences are at a high level. Enterprise Oil achieved excellent results from last year's Corrib appraisal well, producing gas on test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet per day. They have already commenced drilling a second appraisal well there. The company also plan to drill an exploration well this year in the Slyne Trough under licence 2/93. Marathon have submitted a plan of development for the south-west lobe of the Kinsale Head Gasfield and they plan to bring this gas into production by year end.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to promote and encourage, to the fullest possible extent, exploration of the Irish offshore so as to enhance the prospects of commercial discoveries.</P>

Following the inquest, the coroner wrote to me advising that the jury recommended that a competent inquiry be undertaken, with a view to establishing the nature of any changes in sea conditions attributable to HSS vessels.</P>
      <P>Following the inquest, I asked the chief surveyor of the Marine Survey Office to examine this matter further and to advise if a review of the measures already in place in relation to the operation of the HSS vessel in Dublin Bay is warranted. As I have stated in a previous reply to a parliamentary question in this matter, the report in question is not into the drowning of a person which was the subject of an inquest in the normal way, but rather is a review of the position in relation to waves generated by the HSS vessel operated by Stena Line between Holyhead and Dun Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>The chief surveyor has now completed his report and, in accordance with standard practice in these matters, I have asked the Attorney General's office for advice from the legal perspective as it is my intention to make public this report shortly.

      <P>The June 1998 Council of Fisheries Ministers adopted Regulation 1239/98 which bans driftnetting for tuna in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean with effect from 1 January 2002. Ireland and France voted against the adoption while Italy abstained. I opposed the ban on the basis that the council decision was arbitrary, given the absence of conclusive scientific justification for the ban.</P>
      <P>French tuna fishermen registered an application with the Court of First Instance on 1 August 1998 instituting annulment proceedings against Council Regulation 1239/98. In line with our position on the driftnet ban, I secured Government approval to the submission by Ireland of a written intervention in the case. Notification of Ireland's intention to intervene was lodged accordingly with the Court of First Instance before 7 February 1999 deadline for such notifications. I understand that the Irish Tuna Association has lodged a similar notification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> The position at present is that a ruling by the Court of First Instance on the admissibility of the plaintiff's application is awaited.

      <P>While recorded and other estimations of catches and landings by inshore fishing vessels along the southern coast do not suggest a severe decline in demersal catches, it is the case generally that the exploitation of inshore fishery resources by larger vessels is one of the challenges for the long-term conservation of inshore stocks and many of those stocks are currently fully exploited. The need for enhanced conservation, management and development strategies for the inshore fisheries stocks is one of the issues being addressed in the current strategic review of the inshore fisheries resource. BIM, at my request has recently undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the inshore sector. This analysis, which I expect to receive and publish shortly, will inform strategies for addressing conservation, structural management and co-operation issues inherent in the sustainable development and protection of the inshore fisheries resource.</P>

    <P>The large increase in staff numbers in 1997 was due primarily to the transfer to the Department of the Forest Service functions of the former Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the exploration, mining and petroleum affairs divisions of the former Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. Also, in addition to the above staffing complements, a further ten EU funded sea fisheries officers were appointed to the Department's sea fisheries control division in that year.</P>
    <P>The overall level of staffing of the Department and the allocation of staff as between the many different functions discharged by the Department are a matter of ongoing review. I can assure the Deputy that the staffing needs of those divisions concerned with the fishing sector generally will be given due priority.</P>

      <P>Licensing of sea fishing vessels is governed by section 222B (as amended) of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959. The key objective of licensing policy is to ensure the conservation and rational exploitation of available fish stocks, consistent with Ireland's legal obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy in relation to fleet capacity, fishing effort and conservation parameters. It is the basic requirement of fishing boat licensing policy, reflecting mandatory EU fleet policy, that a licence may only be granted for the introduction of a new vessel where the applicant undertakes to remove capacity at least equal to the tonnage and engine power of the boat to be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principles and criteria of sea fishing licensing policy have been publicly articulated on numerous occasions, in replies to questions in the House, responses to particular inquiries and other public statements. In that context, I have already confirmed to the House my intention to publish comprehensive guidelines on the licensing process, procedures and criteria in the interests of maximum transparency. My Department has circulated to the representative organisations of the fishing industry an outline statement of licensing policy for sea fishing vessels which will be elaborated into a comprehensive statement of policy, criteria and procedures. I have asked the Department to expedite its work in this regard with a <Col N="1212" /> view to finalising and publishing the document as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in my reply to a similar question on 11 February 1999, the position in relation to the Corrib Field is that Enterprise Oil and their partners Saga Petroleum and Statoll Exploration (Ireland) Limited drilled an appraisal well last year and produced gas on test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. The licensees are not able to give precise figures for the size of the gas accumulation at this stage and they will not be able to do so until they have fully evaluated the accumulation. The evaluation process involves a further appraisal well which the company commenced drilling on I May. Additional appraisal work will be undertaken in the light of the results of the current appraisal well.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities within the constraints of EU legislation. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators' Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Arising from discussions with the Irish Offshore Operators' Association and SIPTU, I arranged that my Department set up and facilitate discussions between representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators' Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, SIPTU, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry. These discussions are ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention that Enterprise Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, <Col N="1213" /> Trade and Employment, has responsibility for ensuring maximum input of Irish industry in offshore exploration activities. They have been very active in this area for some time and have assisted the operators in identifying Irish companies who can tender for work and have assisted companies by identifying opportunities that are arising in both petroleum exploration and production.</P>

In the meantime, I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the European Union has adopted a directive requiring all vessels carrying such materials bound for or leaving a Community port to comply with strict notification procedures and controls.</P>
      <P>I signed the regulations transposing the directive in question into Irish law on 21 April 1999 as required under the terms of the directive even though such vessels do not use Irish ports or transit Irish waters and I am gratified that the EU controls in question now apply to all vessels en route to Sellafield.</P>

      <P>Year 2000 compliance is a major challenge facing all business interests, including the marine sector. We are all aware of the potential for failure of computer systems on or after 1 January 2000. We also need to be aware and act on potential problems with embedded systems which are used to control and monitor various marine equipment and systems. Everyone in the marine sector is tasked with tackling the problem.</P>
      <P>The year 2000 (Y2K) issue is being tackled on two fronts, namely, in the Department's own search and rescue communications systems and within the marine industry itself. A number of key steps have been taken by my Department in an effort to minimise disruption to the marine sector from the Y2K computer problem. As previously advised to the House, my Department and the Irish Marine Emergency Service have made considerable progress with their action programme to address the Y2K compliance issues.</P>
      <P>The Department's IT systems, office equipment and other plant have been upgraded and non-compliant equipment is being replaced. Work has commenced on the installation of upgraded communications links between Dublin offices and remote locations.</P>
      <P>In line with Government action generally my Department initiated an awareness campaign, targeting the marine sector, on the need for plans of action to deal with the Y2K problem. A marine notice issued on 28 September 1998 setting out guidelines for practical corrective strategies. The notice set out a basic strategy which may be adopted in achieving Y2K compliance, in the shipping sector in particular.</P>
      <P>Ultimately responsibility for year 2000 compliance rests with each participant in the marine sector. I can assure the Deputy that appropriate action is being taken, both within my Department and the agencies under its aegis, to ensure timely compliance of relevant systems for the year 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>Since gas production commenced from the Kinsale Head Gasfield in 1978 and from the Ballycotton Gasfield in 1991, about one and a half trillion cubic feet of gas has been produced to date. However, gas production from the fields has gone into decline and will continue to fall during the remaining life of the fields until they reach their expected economic termination by about the year 2005.</P>
      <P>Future gas supplies from Kinsale and Ballycotton depend, not only on the amount of gas remaining in the reservoir and how much it is possible to extract from a technical point of view, but also on the economics of producing and selling the gas. The latest projected figure of recoverable reserves from the field, as estimated by my Department, is close to 250 billion cubic feet (bcf). This estimate takes account of Marathon's recently announced intention of bringing into production the untapped reserves in the southwest lobe of the Kinsale Head Gasfield, which they estimate to contain approximately 30 bcf of recoverable gas. A detailed plan of development for these reserves has been submitted for my approval by Marathon and they propose to bring the gas into production by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to future arrangements for the extraction of gas, I understand from Marathon that they are preparing for a multi-million dollar investment programme to up-grade gas compression facilities in the fields. These compressors are intended to boost natural well pressures which decline as the fields are depleted. Along with this upgrade, Marathon will evaluate all means of ensuring maximum productivity from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton Gasfields and of course my Department will continue to monitor the fields' progress.</P>

      <P>My own commitment and that of the Government, to the continued development of the fishing industry is clearly underlined in delivery of exceptional funding support and tax incentives for the whitefish fleet renewal programme supporting up to £60 million investment in the fleet. I also achieved, in the context of the budget for 1999, a major increase in Exchequer funding for fishery harbours and aquaculture infrastructure development. These initiatives, together with ongoing EU funding support under the fisheries operational programme and the PESCA community initiative, are contributing to bridging the regional and sectoral development gap for the Irish fishing industry and to enhance its competitive position within the EU fishing industry overall.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources the reason fishing restrictions were put on fishermen precluding them from fishing for the non-quota species of blue whiting which were fished for the first time in 1997; his views on whether Irish fishermen were discriminated against in view of the fact that other countries continued fishing for this non-quota species after the ban was introduced; and the sanctions, if any, which will be taken against these countries which continue to fish.</Quest>

      <P>The European Community quota of blue whiting for 1999 in Area Vb, VI and VII amounts to 133,000 tonnes. Some 20,000 tonnes and 1,500 tonnes of this quota is allocated to Spain and Portugal, respectively, with the balance of 111,500 tonnes being available to all other EU member states.</P>
      <P>The European Commission informed Ireland and other member states on 16 April that the unallocated quota of 111,500 tonnes had been exhausted and that the relevant procedure to provide for Commission closure of the fishery was being instituted. Following consultation with the Commission and on the basis of legal advice that member states were indeed under an obligation to close the fishery for their fleets with immediate effect, an order to close the fishery for the Irish fleet came into effect on 22 April.</P>
      <P>It became apparent, however, that while a number of member states had also closed their fishery, vessels from two other member states continued to fish for blue whiting in the days following the closure. This was entirely unacceptable to me and the Irish fishing industry. I took up the matter directly with Commissioner Bonino, demanding that she take immediate action to ensure that Community law was respected by all member states and confirm to me without delay that this action had indeed been taken.</P>
      <P>The Commission responded to me two days later to the effect that they had ordered the two member states concerned to cease fishing for blue whiting in line with their legal obligations. The Commission has confirmed that these member states then closed the blue whiting fishery to their vessels.</P>
      <P>I have been to the forefront in pressing the EU for action to ensure that fisheries control is applied across the board. I will continue to press the Commission to ensure that EU fishermen operate in this and other fisheries, on a level playing field and that the rules are enforced by all member states.</P>

      <P>A total of 19 fishing vessels registered in other countries, of which seven were UK-registered Spanish vessels, were detained by the Irish authorities in the period from April, 1998 to the present. The detentions arose from suspected fisheries offences including logbook infringements, retention on board of undersize fish and failure to make entry or exit reports. Fines and forfeitures ranging from £350 to £31,500 have been imposed in 13 cases, one vessel was released without charge and a formal written warning was issued to another. Four cases are before the courts at present.</P>
      <P>The Irish authorities are working to ensure close co-operation by other EU member states, notably the UK, France and Spain on fisheries enforcement. For example, data provided by our fisheries control services to the UK authorities was critical to a number of successful fisheries prosecutions by the UK of flagships last year resulting in fines of over £1 million. This liaison is being maintained and intensified in order to ensure strict enforcement of fisheries regulations by all member states. Revocation of a fishing vessel's licence would be primarily a matter for the national authorities in the country of registry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware how vital ports are to the economy and to keeping trade moving efficiently and on time. Although investment in ports has greatly improved the capacity and quality of port facilities, the level of growth in Ireland's international trade and in port activity generally underlines the need for continued investment. Some 90 per cent of trade by volume and 84 per cent by value is transported through Ireland's ports each year.</P>
      <P>In relation to the optimum development of commercial seaports, my Department has overseen the transformation of the Irish commercial seaports over the past ten years by a number of major investment programmes (the operational programme for peripherality 1989 to 1993 and the operational programme for transport 1994 to 1999, (OPT), the Cohesion Fund and the Ireland/ Wales Maritime INTERREG Programme, 1994 to 1999), linking of grant aid to the removal of major institutional bottlenecks in seaports; and the establishment of modem commercially motivated and organised semi-state bodies under the 1996 Harbours Act.</P>
      <P>Over the ten year period from 1989 to 1999, the total investment in ports under all of the programmes listed above is estimated to be £220 million, of which some £163 million will have been expended under the current round of OPT, Cohesion and INTERREG initiatives.</P>
      <P>The development and modernisation of the ports industry could not have been achieved without grant assistance under the above programmes. The scale of the various funding programmes reflected the low level of investment in the ports industry generally before the programmes were put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding these past achievements, there still remain a number of important deficiencies to be addressed in the ports industry. Ports have inadequate facilities to cope with continued massive growth which is forecast in the unitised modes in particular. Competitive forces between ports need to be strengthened. Continued reductions in port costs will maximise competition between ports. Scope exists to increase port efficiency levels to maximise the use of existing infrastructure. Irish ports need to continue to reduce cost levels to the lowest levels achieved in the best ports internationally. There <Col N="1222" /> is scope for further rationalisation of the port sector through, for example, co-operation agreements between adjacent State ports to maximise services and cost efficiencies to port users.</P>
    <P>To determine the needs of the port industry, my Department commissioned independent consultants to complete a detailed study on future seaport capacity requirements to 2007, funded under the OPT technical assistance measure. This study points clearly to the need for a third national port development programme as part of the next national development plan.</P>
    <P>Based on the examination of the port industries' importance to the economy and of its development importance to needs over the period to 2007, it is clear that a substantial investment programme is required for ports. In preparation of the next national development plan for post 1999 Structural Fund allocations, my Department consulted fully with all the port companies and harbour authorities requesting that they identify proposals for investment priorities for the NDP.</P>
    <P>Following a comprehensive consultation process involving all commercial seaports including regional seaports, port and maritime infrastructural development, projects have been identified and costed in the context of possible funding allocations under the next round of EU Structural Funding post 1999.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with general policy guidelines for Coillte in response to Dáil Question No. 19 today. The felling of trees is governed by Part IV of the Forestry Act, 1946. It is the policy of my Department to consult with competent authorities where environmental considerations are identified. Furthermore, it is a condition of the award of any felling licence that all felling and planting operations must be carried out in accordance with forestry and archaeology, forestry and fisheries and forestry and the landscape guidelines published by my Department. The licensee must also act in accordance with the general practice of good forestry.</P>
      <P>The same general guidelines apply to all licensees. I have no knowledge of any deviation from these guidelines in relation to felling licences currently in operation. The utilisation of any felling licences granted is subject to long-term ongoing inspection by the forest inspectorate of my Department.</P>
      <P>In relation to the protection of wildlife, this matter is covered by the Wildlife Act, 1976 and as such comes under the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years considerable sums have been expended under the Defence Vote in updating Naval Service vessels and equipment. The total amounts spent on such items in the past four years were 1995 &ndash; £4.3 million, 1996 &ndash; £4.1 million, 1997 &ndash; £10.1 million, 1998 &ndash; £15.5 million and it is anticipated that expenditure will be in the region of £22.5 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>The more important developments in relation to the improvement of Naval Service vessels and equipment include the construction currently of a new fishery protection patrol vessel and the refit of five of the existing seven Naval Service vessels. The new vessel is due for delivery later this year and will cost more than £20 million.</P>
      <P>Refits involve replacing and/or refurbishing obsolete or deteriorated equipment and are necessary to extend the operational life of a vessel. Earlier this year a refit of <i>LE Eithne</i> was completed in the Naval Dockyard, Haulbowline, at an estimated cost of £2.06 million. In previous years four other vessels &ndash;<i>LE Emer, LE Deirdre, LE Aoife</i> and<i> LE Aisling</i>&ndash; have been similarly refitted. The two remaining vessels &ndash;<i>LE Orla</i> and <i>LE Ciara</i>&ndash; will undergo refurbishment over the next two years, with work starting on <i>LE Orla</i> later this year. These refits have been facilitated by part-cost recoupment under the European Union fishery protection programmes.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that a fair share of available resources has been allocated to the Naval Service to enable it to discharge effectively the tasks assigned to the service.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for the superintendent registrars and registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made with An tArd-Chláraitheoir and I understand that a death may be registered by a relative present at the death on foot of a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner who attended the deceased in his or her last illness. In the case of sudden death, where the cause of death was unclear or in the case of a death in suspicious circumstances, the death must be referred to the coroner. It is sometimes necessary to hold a post mortem examination before referring the death to the coroner. In these circumstances the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages must await the coroners certificate before registering the death. The coroner may decide that an inquest is necessary and not issue his or her certificate until after the inquest has made its findings. Alternatively the coroner may decide on the basis of the post mortem examination that an inquest is not required and will notify the Registrar of the particulars for the registration of the death.</P>

      <P>In regard to disability benefit payments which are currently delivered at post offices the administration of these payments is being transferred to a different computer system. Under the new system, it will be possible for customers to continue to collect their payments at post offices.</P>
      <P>My policy, and that of my predecessors, has been to ensure that the most modern and the widest range of payment methods are available to social welfare customers according to their personal needs and preferences.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was examined by a medical assessor of my Department on 20 October 1998 who considered that she did not <Col N="1231" /> satisfy the medical criteria for receipt of disability allowance.

    <P>She appealed this decision and was re-examined by another medical assessor on the 14 December 1998 who also considered that she was not medically eligible for receipt of disability allowance.</P>
    <P>Following an oral hearing of her appeal, an appeals officer disallowed her appeal. In giving his decision, the appeals officer indicated that he was not satisfied that the person concerned is substantially handicapped and incapable of undertaking suitable employment by reason of a specified disability.</P>

      <P>All proposals put to my Department regarding turf cutting in raised bogs proposed as special areas of conservation, including the one from the West Roscommon Turf Cutters Association, were examined in full. Unfortunately, mechanisms to protect the interior of bogs, i.e., to prevent, in particular, the drying out of the bog, cannot be guaranteed to be successful and, as such, would not be compliant with Directive No. 92/43/EEC, which obliges me to protect and conserve such designated areas. The only option, therefore, is to cease intensive cutting immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> However, I am conscious of the social and economic impact that immediate cessation would have on small communities and I have decided to make exceptional arrangements in the case of cutters for domestic use.

      <P>The law in relation to gaming is contained in the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and section 14 of that Act renders gaming by persons under the age of 16 years unlawful. The Act also gives local authorities a facility to choose whether or not they wish gaming halls to operate legally in their areas. Arising from the exercise of this facility, gaming halls are illegal in most of the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 is, of course, a matter for the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions. I am advised by the Garda that they are not aware of any particular problem at present in connection with under-age gaming. On receipt of a specific complaint, however, they will investigate and take appropriate action.</P>
      <P>There have been many developments in the area of gaming and lotteries since the introduction of the 1956 Act and several aspects &ndash; including the question of enforcement &ndash; now merit attention. I have, accordingly, decided to undertake a comprehensive, formal review of the above legislation and preparatory work in the area has already begun in my Department. Details of the review will be announced in the near future and will involve consultation with interested parties and the general public. It is intended to bring forward proposals for consideration by Government by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The way in which resources are provided to second level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges and voluntary secondary schools. Consequently, direct comparison between the two sectors is difficult. The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant to cover VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis based upon enrolments. I am aware of the demands for increased <Col N="1234" /> funding by voluntary secondary schools. There are also demands for increased funding in the other sectors of education as well as demands for increased spending on other public expenditure programmes. Notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, the levels of support for voluntary secondary schools has been increased since the publication of the ASTI report referred to by the Deputy. The standard per capita grant payable to voluntary secondary schools has been increased to £184 from £177 and assistance towards the provision of secretarial services in schools has been increased from £25 per pupil to £30 per pupil, thereby increasing the maximum annual grant from £8,750 to £10,500 per eligible school. In addition, these schools have benefited under the IT 2000 initiative. Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to improve further the financial position of second level schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.</P>
      <P>A steering group on funding is currently examining the matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level. Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools.</P>
