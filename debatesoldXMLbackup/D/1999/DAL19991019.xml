    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in reply to a similar question on 12 May I asked Government Departments to report to me on proposals for constitutional amendments in relation to their functional areas of responsibility arising from the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the programme for Government. My Department is examining the responses received from other Departments and considering how proposals for constitutional amendments arising from these deliberations might best be brought forward in a structured and consolidated way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from that reply the Government, as such, has no specific proposals for constitutional reform and that no formal proposals for amending the Constitution have been originated by the Cabinet and are currently before the all-party committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no particular proposals from the Government before the all-party committee. The all-party committee has made three reports which contain many issues that are very important to the Government, including proposals on the presidency. A report on the Judiciary is due shortly. The Government is committed to many of these. There is one proposal in <Col N="770" /> the foreign affairs area with which we will have to deal next year and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will bring it forward in due course. There are a number of reports and Departments have been responding to me since early summer. Many of the proposals for constitutional amendments are complex. We have to work out a way to deal with them. There are non-contentious, contentious and technical proposals and we must find a format in which to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. May I restate the question in a slightly different way? Am I correct in thinking that, notwithstanding the reports in the newspapers, the Cabinet has no proposals to change the Constitution or the structure of the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no proposal before the Government yet but, as the Deputy knows, work is being done on electoral reform, which is also before the all-party committee. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has stated his views and there is an active debate on that issue which, in due course, I am sure will formalise itself into proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any truth in suggestions which have appeared in the newspaper that the Government wishes to get rid of the current proportional representation system where the electorate decides the order in which TDs are elected and substitute it with a system whereby, in effect, the party headquarters would decide the order in which TDs would be elected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such proposal yet but, as Deputy Bruton knows, people here have spoken about the list system. That is a regular system across continental Europe. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government proposed that we should have a system similar to that used in presidential elections and by-elections, and that proposal should be considered, but there is a long way to go to activate this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the experience we had when Mr. Haughey was leader of Fianna Fáil is one that goes against giving the leader or head office of any party the right to select the order in which particular Deputies would have the chance to be elected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All proposals for electoral reform will have to be examined. It is good to have a debate on the issue, as we have stuck with this system for a long time. Perhaps after the debate we will end up with the same system. Electoral reform is something we should not be afraid to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the list system in particular, does the Taoiseach agree that the country's experience of the way in which one person, in control of one party, was able to pollute the entire political system is one which would argue against <Col N="771" /> giving a party's leadership the power, through a list system, of deciding who should and who should not be elected, given that this gentleman wanted to intimidate people when voting in parliamentary party meetings? Do we want to add to that the power of selecting who would and who would not be elected in a particular constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Bruton wants a debate on another issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not. It is a good illustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a good illustration, Deputy Bruton should put his views forward in the debate, as he is fully entitled to do. All we are saying, as we have done for the past few years, is that it is a good idea to debate electoral reform and we should see what changes we can make in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not reform. It is taking away from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we will see what system would be best into the next millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the debate on electoral reform has largely been dominated by the larger parties, which are concerned with inter-candidacy rivalry, as, allegedly, it is claimed that elected members of those parties cannot do their work properly? Does he agree that if we are to focus on reform we should look at the marvellous example the all-party sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts has given in the way it has carried out its work? The issue of reform is not how one gets into this House but what one does when one gets here and the resources one has to enable one to work. The example set to the nation on TG4 is the way to go, rather than for Fianna Fáil to try, for the third time, to abolish proportional representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in favour of the committee system. I have praised the work of the Committee of Public Accounts in the House and elsewhere. I prepared much of the work on the compellability legislation in my time as Minister for Finance. I am glad to see it work and hope it continues to work. However, I am not sure why people are edgy about a debate on electoral reform. Our system may be the best in the world. Maybe there are not enough of us or maybe there are too many of us. Maybe we do not have enough resources, maybe we have too much, but I do not see what is wrong with debating these issues. People should not come to the conclusion that Fianna Fáil has a machiavellian plot to change this. We are a little short of numbers to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the Taoiseach wants change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that. In the argument about multi-seat constituencies, if I were Deputy Quinn I would be looking at the constituencies where my party does not have a seat. Maybe reform will give his party more seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had two major debates here on Dáil reform in the past five years. I would have thought the list system had considerable appeal for certain party leaders, but maybe not. In replying to the original supplementary from Deputy Quinn, the Taoiseach spoke about an ongoing debate. Is that within the Cabinet or within his party, or is he referring to a forthcoming debate in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On electoral reform?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution has already discussed the issue. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, on behalf of the Government, proposed in the programme for Government that we should actively look at this&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a Government proposal on behalf of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. We have referred the electoral reform issues to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.</P>
      <P>We have also done our utmost to promote this debate within the Government parties and I hope it has been debated within other parties. There are a range of issues to examine and it is good that people set out their positions. Some people do not like the list system, or do not want party headquarters to have too much control. Others want smaller constituencies with fewer numbers. Some people point out that the US Senate has 100 members but we have 166 Members. It is good that a range of points of view have been put forward and I do not see why any of us should be afraid of that. The Government will come to a conclusion on the outcome of that process. I hope that will be in the lifetime of this Government but, if not, it will be in the lifetime of the next Government. That is all we are seeking to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a member of his own party, Deputy Roche, proposed an amendment to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution? Will this become a reality or was <Col N="773" /> the Deputy simply flying a kite? Does the Taoiseach believe that electoral reform would be premature without real reform of local government? Does he believe that we first need a division between national and local government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Roche has a well researched and structured argument which he put forward at our party meeting last week and which will be further examined. Whether it is possible, or whether it is the right course to take is a matter for the future. In Government and in Opposition, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, argued Deputy Gormley's case that local government is equally important. Deputy Dempsey has brought forward a wide range of legislation and proposals to improve the structure of local government in line with electoral reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated that electoral reform is being actively considered by the all-party committee. The committee recently carried out a survey of Members of the Oireachtas. Is the Taoiseach aware that the response to the survey from members of his party did not indicate any great enthusiasm for changing the present structure? Will he confirm that the Government will not make a commitment to change or make any decision until the all-party committee has finalised its report on this issue which will not take much longer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will wait until the all-party committee has completed its useful work on all of these issues. I will not answer the Deputy's other question as the questionnaire was confidential.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P> The report of the Public Prosecution System Study Group has been considered by Government and presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government accepted the study group's key conclusions and recommendations that the present prosecution system should not be replaced by a unified system but should be enhanced to improve co-ordination and effectiveness.</P>
      <P>The study group addressed the issue of greater cohesion in the criminal justice system. Among the recommendations in the report are the transfer of responsibility for the criminal division of the CSSO and the state solicitor service to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Government has accepted this in principle and implementation will be agreed by the Minister for Finance and the Attorney General. The report also contained a number of recommendations designed to improve the information and communication capabilities of the system and these will take place over time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Victims' Charter recently published by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In relation to the offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor, the charter reflects the practice of these offices for many years. The charter will have the effect of formalising this practice and will generally make the public more aware of the services provided. This may involve an increase in the demand for such services and any resulting staffing and administrative issues will be addressed as the need arises.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has completed an investigation in the Chief State Solicitor's office into alleged misappropriation of cheques over a period of years. A file has been sent to the DPP for a decision on the matter. In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further on the issues in the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the Victims' Charter to allow victims to demand a review of a case where the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided not to proceed with a prosecution. How will that provision operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I did not grasp the question.</P>

    <Col N="775" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the provision in the Victims' Charter operate, whereby a victim of a crime will be entitled to demand a review of a case by the DPP where the DPP, having investigated the case, decides not to prosecute a particular individual? What will be the consequences of such a review? Will it involve the possibility of the decision being reversed? In what way will the independence of the DPP be maintained in cases where there may be a large amount of public pressure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the Victims' Charter reflects the practice that has applied in the DPP's office for a long number of years, as stated in his first annual report, because this is an issue which has been raised many times. Requests for reviews of decisions by those with a legitimate interest are looked at sympathetically by the DPP's office and this has been the practice over a great number of years.</P>
      <P>As regards what procedure is then adopted, I cannot answer that. It is totally a matter for the DPP. However, this case was made to the outgoing DPP and last year I heard him speak on it when he held an international conference. His view was that whether the judgment was made, when people hold strong views his office should listen sympathetically. In some cases perhaps it will have some influence on how the office will deliberate subsequently. In other cases it is a matter of them explaining the position or stance the office has taken. What I heard him say &ndash; I am not sure it forms the background of this report &ndash; is that he is trying to deal with cases as sympathetically as possible. In most cases that means he cannot do much about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying, therefore, that this aspect of the Victims' Charter will not change existing practice? Is he aware of a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 September, which stated clearly that victims of crime would now be able to demand a review of their case and that victims had not been able to do so previously in the sense of having a right at least to a reply to their letter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that this formalises what will happen but that people pressed before for it. If people pressed before for it and they always got their way, I do not know why it was always a burning issue with the people. I cannot answer that question. I am told that it was dealt with sympathetically. If somebody has a stated case which they believe is a legitimate view and the DPP's office believes it is so, under the Victims' Charter the office will listen to that case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the victim will get the review, the sympathetic hearing and <Col N="776" /> the opinion of the DPP. I am told that that is not necessarily new but that it will formalise the position.</P>

      <P>In an attempt to be in order, therefore, is the Taoiseach aware that on occasions the system has failed dramatically, causing widespread concern? How does the Government address the issue of, on the one hand, maintaining the independence of the Office of the DPP from political influence, which is an aspiration we all share, although Fianna Fáil opposed it in 1974, and at the same time ensuring that the operation of that office, in general as distinct from individual cases, is held accountable to the Oireachtas? How can we address both of those concerns simultaneously? Having regard to the widespread concern in respect of the extraordinary case about which we read recently, does the Government have any proposals to address that issue?</P>

      <P>With regard to the action the Government can take, we will produce legislation, whether it be related to criminal law or any other aspect of the legal system, provide adequate staffing to the relevant institutions of the State &ndash; in this instance the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions &ndash; and establish the necessary research and other facilities. The Deputy will be aware that I cannot comment on the case to which he referred because I do not have responsibility for the conduct of individual prosecutions. The report on the public prosecution system, with which some of these questions deal, and the results of the study group, which arise from earlier work carried out by former Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, were designed to streamline the prosecution system, make it more efficient and effective and ensure that a better service is provided.</P>

      <P>Since we received the report and the Attorney General's examination of it, the Government has, in principle, approved it. Those matters must now be discussed with the various industrial relations interests in order to allow these sizeable changes to be made to the offices in question. The criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office is probably the largest section of that office and employs between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of its staff. Total responsibility for that division will be transferred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, as will the State solicitors' system. This will depend on the speed with which discussions and negotiations can be concluded but I estimate that this will take some time. As the report states, new facilities and additional resources will be required and negotiations in this regard will have to be entered into with the Department of Finance. However, there is support for the proposals and the negotiations with the trade unions are about to commence, if they have not already commenced.</P>

      <P>The report, which the Deputy has had an opportunity to peruse, is interesting, it answers many of the questions that have been raised and it contains details of studies carried out in other countries. However, the study group was far from convinced that major changes in the broad structure of the current system would be justified and it set out its arguments in that regard. The view of the group was that the present system works reasonably efficiently, very economically and is an equitable and acceptable system. It points out possible improvements. It refers to the fact that the Garda deals with 500,000 cases every year and points out how these should be dealt with. It recommends that officers of different rank should deal with these cases and it speaks about training. In the overall assessment, the group does not favour a unified system. Following the Gleeson investigation into the law offices of the State and the Deloitte &amp; Touche inquiry that went with it, it was recommended that this issue be examined. It has now been examined comprehensively by an expert group &ndash; I thank the people who gave their time to the group over 12 months &ndash; and its recommendations will go a long way towards improving the system. The group did not recommend a unified system or recommend that the 500,000 prosecutions per year in the Dublin District Court be transferred to the DPP. The group set out, at some length, why it does not believe that is necessary or desirable.</P>

That is independent of any action the DPP will take.

I do not wish to comment on the case referred to, but other aspects have been identified and the office is in the process of updating systems and control and requisitioning procedures to ensure, to the best of our ability, that fraud cannot take place.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I met Dr. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, in his capacity as Moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church, in Government Buildings on Thursday, 30 September 1999. We discussed recent attacks on the Free Presbyterian Church property in Corragarry and Tullyvallen, County Monaghan. I condemned without reservation the violent attacks on the church property. I also stressed to Dr. Paisley that the local community representatives in the areas concerned are appalled at the recent attacks.</P>
      <P>I have asked the gardaí to increase their vigilance in protecting church property in Monaghan and the Border area generally and to ensure special attention is paid to vulnerable places of worship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree freedom of worship is one of the fundamentals of civilisation and that this House condemns, without the slightest reservation, the attacks on the Free Presbyterian Church in Monaghan, in this jurisdiction? When speaking to Dr. Paisley, did the Taoiseach avail of the opportunity to ask him to use his influence to ensure sectarian attacks on Catholics, particularly in the vicinity of Portadown, cease? Does the Taoiseach agree he and Dr. Paisley share a common concern to ensure sectarianism does not take the violent forms it has unfortunately taken in recent times to the detriment of both communities on this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the first part of Deputy Bruton's statement. We all condemn attacks on any place of worship and some of the recent attacks were quite serious and caused considerable damage to small communities which are not in a position to withstand them financially. These attacks also create insurance and other dif<Col N="780" /> ficulties. Attacks on church property or any religious property are wrong and cannot be accepted. I hope the Garda follows up on the matters efficiently, as I am sure it will.</P>
      <P>I raised the attacks on Catholics in Carrickfergus and Portadown and the sectarian incidents this year as a result of which many Catholics were burned out of their homes or had to leave them. Catholics are intimidated most Saturdays of the year when they go to worship at Harryville church. I asked the good doctor to use his influence to make sure that those incidents stop as well.</P>

Did he indicate to Dr. Paisley that this was as much a matter of local vandalism as one of sectarianism or do the reports which the Taoiseach now has indicate that, notwithstanding an element of wanton vandalism, there is an undercurrent of sectarianism in this State, as was manifested against the Free Presbyterian churches?</P>

Regarding some of the incidents raised by Dr. Paisley on his visit, does the Taoiseach acknowledge the Garda statement yesterday that they were, indeed, incidents of pure vandalism?

I am also aware that he and his elected colleagues in the constituency have been strong on these issues on the ground.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to sectarian attacks on both Catholics and Protestants, why has there apparently been an increase in such attacks in recent times? Is there any possibility that people are using the absence of violence as an opportunity to give vent to their feelings of hatred in other ways? Does the Taoiseach feel that there is anything more we can do to influence public opinion, through education, to reduce the grave incidences of sectarianism which are experienced by whoever happens to be the minority in a particular area? In places such as Antrim and Portadown the Catholic population is in the minority and in other parts of Ireland the Protestant population is in the minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though it was a relatively quiet summer, the Deputy is correct when he says there was an enormous number of sectarian attacks. Most of these attacks take the form of people being forced from their houses. I have heard many reports about how this is done and, like Deputy Bruton, I do not want to say which side does what. We talk nowadays about areas being cleansed. There are clearly people on either side who believe that if a housing estate is predominantly made up of one side, the object of the exercise is to ensure there is no one of the other religion in it. That is senseless. There is one estate which Deputy Currie knows well that has changed totally in 20 years. It was built for Catholics but in this case they have almost all been forced out. There are other examples of similar cases along the peace line. We must continue to encourage people to recognise that sectarian attacks are against their own and their families' interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always heartened by the co-operation that exists among those groups which take part in North-South affairs, whether in training, education or holidays, and whether the people involved are young or old. That is an enormous help in this situation. I recently met a group of which no one was under 40 &ndash; probably not many were under 50 &ndash; and not one of that group had <Col N="782" /> ever been south of the Border. If we can do more in that area, it will change the ferocious prejudices which still remain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that his description of this phenomenon as &ldquo;ferocious prejudices&rdquo; could be better put? Does he agree that one way to deal with this would be for political leaders to address their own constituents with the same tolerant face they use when addressing the rest of the world? Frequently there is a difference between the reasonable face political leaders present to the television cameras and the way in which they speak to their own constituents. People need to speak with equal firmness and tolerance to those in their own community as they do to the world outside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good day for the House to refer to these matters. Yesterday the Employment Equality Acts and orders were signed into law in this State. Two weeks ago the same happened in Northern Ireland. Yesterday at the launch there were groups from the North beside our own people and now these matters are covered by law. I hope the legislation is effective in its operation and that people will work against such matters because they have blighted the past and could blight the future. Political leaders, North and South, should take every opportunity when talking about human rights to be mindful that such rights are for everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Following approval by the Government of the report of the interdepartmental committee on the protection of classified official information, the Department of Finance issued guidelines for Departments in October 1998. In accordance with those guidelines, it is a matter for each Department to adopt procedures to preserve the confidentiality of its classified documents. The procedures to be adopted vary from Department to Department and from division to division within Departments, depending upon the nature of individual records, the reason for classification, the number of people who must have access, the frequency of access etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines were brought to the attention of heads of divisions in my Department in November 1998. In accordance with the requirements of the Finance circular, a review at assistant secretary level of the amount of, and necessity for, material classified as &ldquo;top secret&rdquo; will be undertaken shortly. Overall, and having regard to modern developments in this area such as the Free<Col N="784" /> dom of Information Act, the intent of the Finance circular was to keep the number of documents to be designated &ldquo;top secret&rdquo; to an absolute minimum, to restrict their circulation and to ensure appropriate arrangements for their safekeeping.</P>
    <P>Documents to be classified in this way would be of a type whose release would: put at risk the life or safety of any individual; pose a serious threat to security, defence or international relations;undermine the police or judicial processes involved in dealing with serious crime; adversely affect developments in relation to Northern Ireland; and pose a serious risk to the economic interests of the State.</P>
    <P>Access to &ldquo;secret&rdquo; documents in my office is very restricted. My private secretary retains all documents of this nature in a locked safe if they are not in my personal possession. Certain senior staff in my Department and certain of my senior advisers see some documents but only on a need to know basis. They are individually responsible for such documents while they are in their possession.</P>
    <P>In the case of the report of the authorised officer in the Ansbacher affair, the report was sent to my private secretary and marked strictly private and confidential. The last paragraph of the covering letter indicated that the material enclosed was to be retained in strict conditions of secrecy under the Companies Act. In the circumstances I instructed my private secretary to place it in the safe in my office and it remained there ever since under my direct control. I did not, in this instance, circulate it or give a copy of it to any of my officials or advisers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the accident at Tramore, County Waterford on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps were tragically killed, my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, and I jointly directed that the accident be investigated under Statutory Instrument Number 205 of 1997 &ndash; Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1997. Pursuant to this direction the investigation is being conducted by the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A senior Air Corps officer with appropriate training is acting as investigator-in-charge. He is being assisted by inspectors from <Col N="786" /> the AAIU, Air Corps personnel and two experts from overseas, a principal inspector from the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch and the head of military psychology of the Swedish Armed Forces.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this investigation, which is wide-ranging and complex, is to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents. The report of this investigation will be made public. The regulations provide that the report should be published, where possible, within 12 months of the date of the accident. There is no provision for the publication of preliminary findings. Any safety measures proposed by the investigating team will be implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a Military Court of Inquiry has been convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise and the coroner's report.</P>
    <P>The question of future equipment requirements for the Air Corps will be dealt with in the context of the White Paper on Defence which I plan to bring forward by the end of the year. Following the review of the Air Corps which was carried out by consultants Price Waterhouse, I asked the chief of staff to prepare, in conjunction with the general officer commanding the Air Corps, a draft implementation plan for my consideration to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made in the consultants' report. The draft plan was submitted in recent days and is under examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously in any discussion of this tragedy our first thoughts are with the families who have suffered an appalling loss but I want to put a number of questions to the Minister. In relation to the Dauphin, the helicopter being used at the time, I understand the Air Corps made their views known to the Minister that the Dauphin should not be replaced by another Dauphin but by a medium range aircraft. Has the Minister made a decision on that? Does he accept that a medium range helicopter would be a safer aircraft for the Air Corps to use in search and rescue work because of the extra fuel for diversion and better capacity to uplift more survivors? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to state that all of the equipment and aircraft used by the Air Corps are fully examined to ensure the safety of the pilots, the personnel in the aircraft and whomsoever may be rescued or carried for whatever reason. That being said, it is probably unlikely that a similar type of aircraft would be purchased in the context of changes that have taken place since that time. We have just received the implementation plan from the chief of staff, which I have not yet had an opportunity to read, and we are also finalising the deliberations on the White Paper. Those two combined will be avail<Col N="787" /> able soon and will signpost the type of developments we envisage for the Air Corps which will be very positive, but the determination of the type of aircraft is a specialist area which requires a great deal of attention. As soon as we have made a determination on that I will inform the House but it is unlikely that it will be a similar type of aircraft to what is currently in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>What contacts have been made with the manufactures of the Dauphin in relation to the crash? I understand this helicopter has been replaced on the south east coast. What new safety procedures, if any, have been put in place? In light of the seriousness of what happened on this terrible occasion, has anything been highlighted in the inquiry so far, to warrant the provision of extra safety facilities in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation and the court of inquiry is ongoing and we should not reach any premature conclusions on the cause of the accident. However, safety and safety requirements, as far as the Air Corps is concerned, is something we must constantly review in the light of new information and changed circumstances. The Deputy and the House can be assured that in conducting their duties Air Corps personnel consider safety, and all measures related to it, as a top priority. With the type of work they do, we could not stay in business ten minutes unless these matters were observed to the fullest possible extent.</P>
      <P>There has been contact with the manufacturers. They are not involved in the investigation but parts of the aircraft have been sent back to the manufactures. All of the international opinion I have read in relation to the Dauphin aircraft is strong on safety. Nonetheless parts of the aircraft, for obvious reasons, have been sent back to the manufacturer and we will await the observations that will be made in due course in the context of the overall inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not yet made a decision to reinvest in aircraft for the Air Corps. Will he accept that it is difficult for our Air Corps pilots to see Bond Helicopters, which supplies the service from Dublin and Shannon, using medium lift helicopters even though our pilots are doing equally dangerous search and rescue work? When will the Minister make a decision about investment in the Air Corps? Will he agree that if we are to attract more pilots into the Air Corps, they must see that the Minister is investing in the service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Part and parcel of any good organisation is to make sure that we re-equip and provide the best possible facilities to carry out the functions determined by the Government as required from the Air Corps. The Deputy should not be disappointed. We have had an exhaustive examination of the Air Corps. An implementation plan has just come to hand which I have <Col N="788" /> not yet seen. A White Paper to develop medium-term policy for the Defence Forces as a whole will be published before the end of the year. From recent discussions with senior Air Corps personnel on this matter &ndash; assuming we were in a position to decide today the type of aircraft we require &ndash; it appears that there would still be a time lag, both in terms of the provision of funds and the acquisition of that aircraft. However, we will be engaged in that work in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Minister's views on the newspaper reports that the Air Corps was pressurised into introducing the 24 hour service in this region sooner than it would have liked? This statement was refuted by the Defence Forces' spokesperson. However, does the Minister have any statement to make on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accountable for press reports. From my observations of the Air Corps since I was appointed Minister, it goes to the extremes, in terms of safety, before flying aircraft. There were occasions when I would have liked that situation to be slightly different because I wanted to get somewhere on time. Anybody who is any way associated with the Air Corps would say that any such statement does not have a foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety procedures of the Air Corps are not in question here. Deputy Wall raised the question of whether there was political pressure to introduce the service early. The key point I was making was not about the safety record of the Air Corps itself, but about the resources and type of aircraft that have been made available and the delay in providing helicopters, such as the Sea King used by the RAF, the Super Puma used by the French or the Sikorsky which the Bond company uses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The two things are interconnected. The determination of the Air Corps and air personnel to adhere to very stringent safety procedures means that political pressure could not ever make them ignore any of those fundamentals. Why should it? We are dealing with life and death in such situations and there are not any second chances.</P>
      <P>I have answered the question about equipment many times. I inherited this situation and I could talk about how little was done at different times. However, I will not do that because the responsibility is now mine and I will fulfil that responsibility to the best of my ability.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the number of claims to date for deafness compensation within the Defence Forces; the cost per month in 1999 of meeting these claims; the numbers per month in 1999; the plans, if any, he has for establishing a tribunal; if so, the proposed date for its establishment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>By 14 October 1999, my Department had received 14,588 claims for alleged loss of hearing from current or former members of the Defence Forces. Of these, 3,872 have been settled or have received court awards. Details in respect of costs paid and numbers of claims received per month in 1999 are set out in the tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may recall that when I last answered questions on this subject on 30 June 1999, I mentioned that the establishment of a compensation scheme will be influenced by the outcome of the appeal in the case of Hanley <i>v</i>. Minister for Defence. I understand the Supreme Court may deliver this shortly. When this important judgment is published, the details will be examined carefully in my Department. Its implications for all outstanding claims and for the establish<Col N="790" /> ment of a compensation scheme will be assessed and costed.</P>
    <P>If the projected cost is acceptable to the Government &ndash; and I hope it will be &ndash; I shall establish a scheme to remove these claims from the courts. This will provide a level of compensation which will be fair and equitable both to the taxpayer and to those personnel who have suffered hearing loss during military service. It will also be administratively straightforward, providing a relatively speedy process of compensating claimants based on the Green Book and the Supreme Court's judgment. Considerable progress has already been achieved in containing the cost. The average quantum of damages per claim for the period January to September 1999 was £12,228. This is reduced from an average of £30,874 in 1996. The scheme will also be designed to reduce the very high level of costs inherent in resolving these claims through the courts.</P>
    <P>I hope the establishment of a compensation scheme based on an acceptable tariff will attract a consensus of support among all of us who are concerned with resolving this issue and in putting its negative consequences behind us.</P>

      <P>How does the number of claims per month this year compare with last year? Has the number of claims decreased this year? When I asked the Minister at the last Question Time about establishing a tribunal, he said that if there was a delay in the delivery of the Supreme Court judgment, he would consider going ahead and establishing a tribunal. Is he at that point yet? Has he the support of the representative associations for establishing such a tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>At no stage did I say I would establish a tribunal. I said I would establish a compensation scheme. A tribunal would be too cumbersome a way to deal with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe that is what the Deputy had in mind. I said the last time that, if there was too long a delay, I would consider doing that in the interim. However, I had to revise my view on that because, in fairness to the Supreme Court, it is entitled to make its decision, which I hope will be helpful. If I were to carry out my own intentions in that regard, I could be seen as casting a reflection on the Supreme Court. I hope that decision will be available to us very soon, so that we can proceed.</P>
      <P>There were 99 claims in January 1999, 130 in August, 75 in September, 76 in May and 62 in March. They are all in the tabular statement, but I can give them quickly to the Deputy now if she wishes. There were 99 claims in January, 98 in February, 62 in March, 128 in April, 76 in May, 119 in June, 33 in July, 130 in August and 75 in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The number of claims has decreased considerably. However, there is no real <Col N="791" /> room for complacency because there are still sturdy numbers of claims being made. The total number of this year and the anticipated total for next year are stubborn figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have an estimated figure for the potential costs at this stage? Are the broad parameters of a compensation scheme worked out? This, of course, will depend on the outcome of the Supreme Court judgment, which I hope will be available soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I also had some preliminary discussions with the representative associations, with entire support going in this direction. It is not possible to give an estimate total costs yet. The costs have changed greatly from what they were a few years ago. The average quantum is about one-third of what it used to be. Therefore, in one sense, the overall costs are down by two-thirds. However, until we know when these claims will end and how many claimants we will be able to attract out of the court system into the new compensation scheme &ndash; when it is set up after the Supreme Court judgment &ndash; we will not be able to make a determination. However, it is clear that if we are able to proceed on this basis and remove the very substantial legal costs associated with court cases, with a tariff that is affordable and fair to both sides, there will be a very significant reduction in the overall costs. The legal costs, between the Chief State Solicitor's side and the plaintiffs' side, are still up to 30 per cent of the overall total costs at present.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the implementation of the Price Waterhouse report on the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Price Waterhouse report on the Defence Forces was submitted to the efficiency audit group in 1993. Arising from this report, the efficiency audit group made certain recommendations to the Government which were accepted in July 1995.</P>
      <P>Following this, an implementation group was set up to prepare a fully costed implementation plan covering the first three year phase of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>In February 1996 the Government accepted the Defence Force Review Implementation Plan, 1996-98, which set out the objectives and targets for the initial phase of the Defence Forces reorganisation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very satisfied with the progress of the overall Defence Forces reorganisation process to date. Among the many objectives achieved, I will highlight the following: a reduction in the overall permanent Defence Forces strength by 1,300 to <Col N="792" /> 11,500 and the allocation of 50 per cent of the resulting pay savings to infrastructure and equipment for the Defence Forces; the successful introduction of a new structure for Defence Forces headquarters; a comprehensive reorganisation of the Army; the introduction of a policy of continuous recruitment; and the completion of the studies of the Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
    <P>In addition, in July 1998 the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements. This decision was taken in accordance with the Price Waterhouse recommendations regarding the rationalisation of military installations. Five barracks were subsequently evacuated and one has since been sold. There are not any plans at present to close any barracks other than those announced last year. The steering group for the study of the reserve Defence Forces recently submitted its report to me, and I am considering its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The momentum for reform of the Defence Forces will continue by means both of the implementation plans for the reorganisation of the Air Corps and Naval Service, which have been submitted to me recently, and the White Paper on Defence which will be completed later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the initial phase, how much remains to be completed of the 1996-98 recommendations? Have the reserve Defence Forces made submissions to the Department or has there been contact between the two regarding the proposals for the reserve Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultative process for the review of the reserve Defence Forces has gone well. The report has been submitted and we are studying it. The steering group was representative, with people from RDFRA involved so that they had an opportunity not only to make submissions but to have one of their members involved in the activities. I look forward to finalising that review.</P>
      <P>It is an interesting time because the implementation plans for the Navy and the Air Corps and the study of the Defence Forces are almost completed. While much still remains to be done, we have almost completed the review process. The Navy and Air Corps reviews were delayed for longer than we anticipated and we needed these to make a complete picture involving barracks closures, continuous recruitment, re-equipment, savings on pay, armoured personnel carriers and improvement in infrastructure. We are being given a design for the next millennium which is proactive, positive, improves equipment and accommodation and is good on recruitment by bringing in more young people so that we have a fitter organisation allowing us to do more United Nations duties. We are far from finalising the matter but we have all the reviews and plans to hand. We were hamstrung for some time by not having those but we are now in a positive phase.</P>

      <P>The White Paper will be published before the end of the year. There were 45 submissions. There was a positive response, not just from the representative organisations and from people with a military background but from the wider public generally. A number sought oral hearings to advance the purpose of their earlier submissions and those were granted. One of those groups was obviously PDFORRA. We are now at the stage where we are ready to carry out the final work on the White Paper and have it published to meet the timescale I set out, which is a little longer than anticipated. However, the number of submissions and the requests for additional time to develop cases were also greater.</P>

      <P>The Government on 15 July 1998 approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located in Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. With the exception of Clancy Barracks, which will be vacated by 1 July 2000, the other five barracks have been vacated.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision, I had consultations with public and community representatives in each of the five locations in which barracks were subsequently evacuated. In addition to those initial meetings, I met Members of the Oireachtas and local councillors in relation to Castleblayney Barracks on 3 February, 3 March and 15 July 1999; local councillors and officials from Naas Urban District Council on 3 March and 10 March 1999 in relation to Devoy Barracks, Naas; and I have met councillors and an official of Kildare County Council on 14 September 1999 in relation to Magee Barracks, Kildare. Discussions also took place between my officials and officials of Cork County Council on 2 December 1998 in relation to Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, and Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. I propose meeting members of Fermoy Urban District Council and officials of Cork County Council on 21 October 1999 to discuss a tender from Cork County Council relating to Fitzgerald Camp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I have decided to sell the site to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000. The legal and financial formalities <Col N="794" /> have yet to be finalised. In the meantime I propose to allow the North Eastern Health Board to occupy the property under a caretaker agreement. As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been rezoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC which was adopted on 29 May 1999, and this property will be offered for sale soon. A tender competition for the appointment of selling agents was advertised yesterday.</P>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, I offered it the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Magee Barracks, Kildare, is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. In the interim, tenders from independent consultants are under consideration for the preparation of an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. The consultants will submit a report within three months of appointment. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable following evaluation of that report. Following a tender competition for the appointment of independent consultants to draw up an integrated action area plan for Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, consultants were appointed on 23 August 1999. That plan is due for completion by 23 November of this year and the property will be disposed of following evaluation of that report.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that a portion of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, is occupied by a battalion of the FCA. The costs for security at Magee Barracks have been borne by the Eastern Health Board since that property was handed over to accommodate Kosovar refugees on 12 May 1999.</P>
    <P>The military authorities have estimated that the savings to date on security duty allowances amount to more than £375,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utilities such as telephone and electricity charges. It is expected that up to £50 million will be realised from the sale of the barracks.</P>

      <P>It appears in a number of cases that the Minister has run into a variety of problems relating to the sale of closed barracks. What is the Minister's estimate of the amount of money which will be reinvested in the Defence Forces as a result of his decision and when will that reinvestment be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that I agree we have run into difficulties. We have had very successful discussions with Naas Urban District Council, we have rezoned the land and we are about to sell it. To do anything before this without obtaining local agreement and rezoning would have been highly irresponsible and would have produced a much worse outcome for the taxpayer and the Defence Forces. We have disposed of Castleblayney and we are almost ready to dispose of Fitzgerald Camp. Area action plans are being drawn up for the large barracks in Ballincollig and Kildare because they are very important for the development of the towns and the plans are necessary to enhance the value of the barracks. There is a broad agreement with that and, when I met representatives of Kildare County Council, they endorsed that, as did those from the Cork local authorities.</P>
      <P>We estimate the total value of these sales will be approximately £50 million. It may well be that, in light of market forces, it could be higher than that when we come to dispose of them. I am optimistic that, for the year 2000 and 2001, significant investment will be made in the Defence Forces arising from those sales. There was an agreement to have 60 per cent of total receipts invested in the Defence Forces which would be about £30 million. If I were successful in having the compensation scheme running properly, I would argue for a slightly larger percentage to go towards investment to assist me with the equipment problems I face and so that I do not always rely on the taxpayer for funding. We have at least 60 per cent but perhaps we could do a little better than that. That would certainly increase the £30 million figure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>The military authorities advise that complaints of bullying or abuse in the Defence Forces arise very rarely. Comprehensive procedures are, however, in place to deal with bullying and abuse in the Defence Forces if such allegations arise. These procedures are outlined in the relevant administrative instructions. This document deals with interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces and is written for all personnel irrespective of rank, gender or sexual orientation. The prevention of bullying and abuse or unacceptable interpersonal behaviour is viewed as being best achieved by the education of all personnel, by way of talks to troops and inclusion in syllabi of training. Personnel may also submit any complaints which they may have through the redress of wrongs procedure, as provided for under section 114 of the Defence Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a number of recent reports in the media on this issue. Obviously, the Minister cannot comment on individual cases but has there been an increase in the number of reports of harassment and bullying within the Defence Forces? Is the Minister satisfied that adequate mechanisms are in place and that people feel free to make reports? In that context, I understand the Minister had promised to appoint an ombudsman for the Defence Forces. Is he still considering that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to fulfil some of his promises now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been six complaints concerning alleged bullying or intimidation in the past three years, none of which was subsequently substantiated. Two such complaints are in the process of being investigated at the moment and, quite separately, four cases are being investigated by the military police, three of which involve alleged sexual assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the numbers are low and there has not been an increase in the number of complaints, even one such infringement is totally unacceptable. It is important that proper instructions, education measures and other systems are available to deal with such infringements. People can also avail of the redress of wrongs procedure after an incident occurs. However, I am more anxious to ensure such matters do not arise in <Col N="798" /> the first instance and I want to ensure a more progressive and enlightened approach to dealing with them should they occur. A review of the complaints procedure is ongoing and we will address the possibility of the appointment of an ombudsman when that is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The specialist staff comprise a chaplain, a medical officer, a Defence Forces' psychologist, a member of the personnel support service and liaison officers. I am satisfied that the Defence Forces has the necessary competence, personnel, training and syllabi to address these matters. How can one say that everything is perfect for all time? We must be constantly conscious of the problems which can befall us in these areas and we must be open to suggestions for improvement, from wherever they come, to eliminate the possibility of such incidents occurring.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 79 and 144 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the death of Private William Kedian and the wounding of Private Ronald Rushe and Private Darren Clarke on 31 May 1999 while serving with the 85th Irish Battalion in Lebanon, a report was forwarded immediately by UNIFIL headquarters to United Nations headquarters, New York. I refer the Deputy to replies which I gave to questions in the House on 30 June 1999 when I outlined the protests lodged with the Israeli authorities following the incident. A UNIFIL headquarters board of inquiry and an Irish contingent board of inquiry were established to investigate and report on the circumstances surrounding the death of Private William Kedian and the wounding of Private Ronald Rushe and Private Darren Clarke. The results of these <Col N="799" /> inquiries, which have not yet been released, are awaited.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I visited the area on 20-22 June 1999 in order to see for myself the situation on the ground and, more importantly, to raise the seriousness of the prevailing security situation in the UNIFIL area of operation with both the Israeli and Lebanese authorities and to seek assurances that the reckless shelling of Irishbatt positions by the Israeli Defence Forces-De Facto Forces which appeared, undoubtedly, to have led to the death of Private Kedian would not recur. During the course of my visit, I met the Israeli Minister of Defence and the Lebanese Minister of Defence, the latter in relation to ongoing hostile activity by the armed elements, Hizbollah. I sought assurances from both that there would not be a recurrence of the recent serious shelling incidents as well as other hostile activity. I indicated to both sides that, while Ireland is committed to the UNIFIL mission, should there not be a cessation of such incidents, serious consideration would be given to the withdrawal of the Irish contingent.</P>
    <P>In the weeks following the death of Private Kedian, while there was a general decrease in the number of firings close to Irish positions, there were a number of further serious incidents, including the dropping of a bomb from an Israeli air force jet several hundred metres from an Irish position as well as a direct mortar hit within an Irishbatt post. In the latter incident, it was most fortunate that there was no loss of life.</P>
    <P>Between 1 January and 30 September 1999, 102 firings at or close to Irish UNIFIL positions have been recorded, the bulk of which were carried out by the Israeli Defence Forces-De Facto Forces. A total of 225 other incidents were recorded in this period. The situation in the UNIFIL area of operations has continued to remain tense. I can bear witness to this fact from my visits to UNIFIL between 20 and 22 June and my more recent visit between 20 and 24 September 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that reports and official documentation have not yet been received from UNIFIL? The unfortunate family of William Kedian has still not received an official report on the circumstances surrounding his death. Neither have other families whose dear ones have been injured in similar incidents. On the question of safety, the following formed part of a report on the Minister's visit to Lebanon in <i>The Irish Times </i>of 22 June:</P>
      <P>At B Company headquarters in Haddathah, for example, Mr. Smith was shown the remains of a shower unit destroyed by an SLA shell, fired after the &ldquo;all clear&rdquo; had been sounded. By a miracle, the message did not get through to the company; otherwise, the unit would have been full of soldiers, emerging from their bunkers, when the mortar landed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> That is a serious statement which was read by the families of personnel serving in Lebanon. What can be done to obtain reports for the families concerned, the Department and the Defence Forces as quickly as possible? If the newspaper report is correct, a catastrophe was avoided by luck rather than by design.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I get a shiver down my spine whenever I think of the incident in question. Having seen the shrapnel, it was only with the help of God that we did not have a great catastrophe on our hands. Fortunately the communication did not get through with the result that our troops were not over ground but in the safety of the bunker.</P>
      <P>On the availability of reports, we have done everything we can. We have protested through UNIFIL and directly through the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department. I have met both Defence Ministers and made our position clear in no uncertain terms. I have said many times that the safety of our troops is of paramount importance in dealing with the circumstances that can arise and also in terms of their equipment and training. I pay tribute to Colonel Pat Nash and his colleagues who, despite a difficult tour of duty and the loss of William Kedian, have been able to maintain such a high standard and bring everybody else home safe and well. I wish the next contingent equal good luck.</P>
      <P>It is always a matter of concern whenever there are delays in obtaining official reports on accidents, in particular those involving fatalities. The experience of the parents and two sisters of William Kedian has been traumatic. I again request the United Nations to speed up the report on the circumstances surrounding his death and to ensure the length of time it takes to produce such reports is reduced. Generally the inquiries of the military tend to be exhaustive in order to produce comprehensive reports. While I do not want to cut across this work, it is time we had the report.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to our commitment to UNIFIL. I understand the new Israeli Prime Minister has given a commitment to withdraw Israeli forces from South Lebanon by July 2000. Does the Minister have any contingency plans to relocate the Irish troops based there or to downscale our commitment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A more optimistic set of circumstances is developing which, in its own way, is creating tension. Nobody knows what the circumstances will be. We welcome Prime Minister Barak's initiative and hope it is successful. If it is, it is likely that UNIFIL will be required in reduced numbers along the border to ensure peace is maintained. This, in turn, will provide an opportunity for relocation. We are under pressure to do more in Kosovo and do not know from where else pressure will come. The Defence Forces will be interested in alternative opportunities. We have been sending troops to Lebanon for 21 <Col N="801" /> years but we want to see the job completed and peace restored. While we welcome the initiatives which have been taken we cannot make much more than a preliminary guess at this stage about what we might do when the work of UNIFIL has been completed.</P>

      <P>It is clear to anyone who has been to South Lebanon that the Irish Defence Forces frequently operate under hostile fire and shelling. Given the changed political situation and the comments of the Israeli Prime Minister, has there been a decrease in the number of incidents with which the Irish Defence Forces have had to deal in recent months following the various international efforts which have been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a definitive answer to that question. It appears that there has been a decrease in the number of attacks on the Irish battalion since June but it may be the case that the focus has switched to other battalions. There is unrest and unease in the area because of the certainty about what is likely to happen. It is my guess that the overall position has not improved even though the position for the Irish battalion has. I hope that will continue to be the position.</P>

      <P>The minimum height requirement for males and females was set at 5 ft 5 in. In March 1998 I reduced the height requirement for females for general service enlistment in the Defence Forces to 5 ft 4 in. Having reviewed the matter again in consultation with the military authorities, I am not in favour of any further reduction in the height requirement as it has been the experience of the medical corps and training units that persons of shorter stature have difficulty carrying the bulk and weight of combat order equipment.</P>
      <P>The current age requirements for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force are as follows:</P>

      <P>Even though he has a point, the Deputy will be aware that from time to time personnel move from one service to another and an immediate bottleneck would come to mind. We are having difficulties filling all the required posts in the Naval Service, I suppose largely because of the Celtic tiger and alternative opportunities. We have a new ship and agreement on its manning. We are in the process of trying to buy another ship to replace one of those going out of commission. It is an issue at which I will look. I am not too sure whether it will be possible, but I would have to look at anything which would help to keep up numbers in the Naval Service against the pressure which exists and alternative employment opportunities. That certainly is one option at which I will look.</P>

I have to have regard to what the medical officer and the practitioners tell me in relation to the height requirement and the fact that injuries are much more likely to occur among those below those heights.

      <P>We have been over this ground but I would appreciate if the Minister would furnish us with medical evidence to show that personnel who are taller can carry greater weights because I do not believe there is such medical evidence. The only evidence I have seen states the contrary. Given that there is only one inch in the height difference requirement for males and females, does the Minister agree that a greater proportion of females are excluded from entry into the Defence Forces and, accordingly, there is discrimination against females?</P>

We are anxious that a process can be found as speedily as possible to deal with the issues raised by nurses with the Minister for Health and Children in recent weeks in a way that is consistent with social partnership. I have assisted in every way I can to find a way to deal with this, as have my colleagues. We welcome the willingness of the Nursing Alliance to work to achieve this and the statement that body made over the weekend. Present indications are that the health services are working in line with the emergency plans agreed with local strike committees. That is good and the negotiations of last week and this week have worked successfully. The Government will continue to monitor developments very carefully and the industrial relations issues, which I am up to date with all the time, are going on as well.</P>

Thankfully, last Saturday an indication was given that they accepted that position, which allowed the Minister for Health and Children to state on Sunday that he accepted that and that if that case was made in a statement he would respond. On Sunday afternoon that statement was made, putting the dispute within the partnership arrangement. That allowed the Minister to have very meaningful discussions yesterday.</P>

    <Title>Partnership for Peace: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, 13 October 1999:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann approves participation by Ireland in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC), and that it further approves the terms of Ireland's PfP Presentation Document, a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 5th October, 1999.</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Minister for Foreign Affairs)</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To add the following to the motion:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;and further accepts that any proposed future amendment to the areas of participation <Col N="812" /> by Ireland in the Partnership for Peace as outlined in the Presentation Document will be put before Dáil Éireann for approval.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is a pity the Partnership for Peace proposals are not well understood and that we did not have this debate some time ago. It is not surprising the public does not have a clear view of what these proposals mean because we have not had an appropriate debate. For once, the media has done a good job and there has been an effort to tease out the main issues, particularly in some of the print media. Politically, however, there has been a remarkable failure to deal with a very serious issue. There has been some shadow boxing but almost a complete failure to engage people in the debate, yet the issue is of significance to them.</P>
      <P>It is more than a question of simple neglect. A number of people within the political establishment have been deliberately muddying the water. In doing so they are doing no service to the Irish people or to the case for our neutrality, which is at an important crossroads and which must be debated. In short, the PfP proposals, their implications and the public concerns deserve more serious attention than they are receiving. My first concern, therefore, is that we are committing Ireland to a course of action which has not been well explained, which at best is poorly understood and on which, hardly surprisingly, there is an abundance of evident confusion.</P>
      <P>The PfP proposals originated with NATO. That is where at least part of the problem lies. NATO is not an organisation which commends itself to the Irish people. The point must be accepted, however, that any idea of a partnership focused positively on the task of creating peace between nations is worthy of consideration on its merits and disadvantages, rather than on the basis of the mythology which has grown up around the idea, as happened in this case.</P>
      <P>It is worth debunking a number of the myths at this point, if only to dispel any notion that questioning the current action proposed by the Government is based on a misunderstanding of the PfP or on some other less worthy motive. For example, Ronan Fanning, professor of modern Irish history in UCD, waxed eloquently on my views on this issue and on what motivates those views. I have discussed many issues with Professor Fanning but I have never discussed PfP with him.</P>
      <P>The PfP is not a military alliance; it is not confined to NATO states. It involves nations from all over Europe &ndash; east and west. Association with the PfP does not mean joining NATO. More than half the states who have signed up for the PfP are not &ndash; most never will be &ndash; NATO members and all of the European neutral states &ndash; Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland &ndash;  with the exception of Ireland have joined Partnership for Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation in this project would not compromise our neutrality, nor would it require commit<Col N="813" /> ting Ireland to revoking or compromising its neutrality. Involvement in the PfP is by way of agreement which is unique in terms of international organisations in that each state, in its Presentation Document, determines its level of participation. Nations join the PfP on what is, in effect, an <i>à la carte</i> basis. Involvement in the PfP does not undermine our commitment to the United Nations or the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE. The Presentation Documents of Finland, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden and Ireland make specific reference to these commitments, with the exception of Switzerland in the case of NATO.</P>
    <P>Why, therefore, should one be excited about Ireland entering Partnership for Peace, with or without a referendum? The answer to this question is rather complex. First, there is a body of people who firmly believe an undertaking was given by my party that there should be a referendum prior to our entering the PfP. At this stage, it is pointless and a waste of time entering into semantic arguments as to the nature of the undertaking which was or was not written into the manifesto in 1997. The undertaking in the Fianna Fáil manifesto was not expressed in absolute terms and there was a significant proviso attached. The actual sentence reads, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil in government will not participate in any co-operative security structure which has implications for Irish neutrality without first consulting the people through a referendum.&rdquo;  No matter how we interpret that sentence, the point is that the people believe an undertaking was given. In modern politics perception is reality. The Irish people have more than enough reason to be cynical about politicians and politics without our giving them another one. Addressing public concern and cynicism is one reason for contemplating holding a referendum.</P>
    <P>There is a much more important reason for having a referendum, perhaps not in the immediate future, but in the not too distant future. Neutrality has never been spelt out in Irish law. When the Constitution was being drafted conditions were very different than at present. Neutrality was far from the norm in national law at the time. Very few constitutions touched on the issue and few do to this day. Times have changed and neutrality has been discussed far more frequently in the past few years than in the 1930s. It is bizarre that while political Ireland is willing to talk endlessly about our neutrality we have never taken the time or the trouble to sit down and determine in clear terms what we mean by &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo;. It is time we did so.</P>
    <P>Politicians who are using this issue to score short-term political points are guilty of misdirecting what could be a very important debate in the life of this country. Our imminent entry into the PfP provides an ideal opportunity to consider the part we as a nation are willing to play in the future development of peace and security in Europe and the wider world. It also gives us the opportunity for the first time to clear our collec<Col N="814" /> tive mind about neutrality, its nature and its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which makes it imperative to consider our neutrality at this point. The common foreign and security policy of the European Union is touched on in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties. To date, the issue of how the CFSP is to be dealt with has been fudged. That situation is unlikely to pertain long into the future. At the EU Council meeting in Finland last weekend it was clear that we are now going to fast-track on common foreign and security policy. Mr. Solana has moved from his position in NATO to become the maestro for CFSP in Europe. Moreover, he will shortly take over the position of head of administration in the Western European Union. The French Government has indicated that it intends to make the issue of European defence a major focus during its forthcoming presidency of the Union. The three other neutral member states of the EU already have some clarity within their basic law on their neutral status but Ireland does not. To allow this situation to pertain for much longer is a fundamental error.</P>
    <P>There is another, and more imperative, reason we should possess within our law a clear and unambiguous statement of how we determine our neutrality as a nation, that is, to bind the hands of Government, not just this Government but every future Government on the issue of neutrality. Sometimes a nation can by neglect lose the very things which it values most, and for us neutrality is one of the things. Neutrality is deeply ingrained in the Irish psyche and we should give the people the opportunity at the earliest possible date to express their views on neutrality.</P>
    <P>The point can be made that in strict legal terms it is not necessary to amend Bunreacht na hÉireann by inserting an amendment on neutrality. The Constitution, it can be argued, already contains a series of provisions which can be construed as a <i>de facto</i> statement of neutrality. In strict legal terms this viewpoint can be and has been well defended. Article 15.6.1º provides an absolute prohibition on maintaining any foreign military base or military force on Irish soil. It will be interesting, in the context of PfP, if somebody decides to take a constitutional challenge on that issue because that aspect of Article 15.6.1º will undoubtedly be challenged at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>Article 28.3.1º of the Constitution, referred to on several occasions in this debate, clearly prohibits the State making a decision on participating in a war without the consent of the Dáil, although the practicalities of convening the Dáil to agree a motion have often exercised my mind as they would involve us asking somebody to wait offshore before they land. By extension of Article 28.3.1º any international agreement which would have the effect of binding Ireland to an alliance which attempted to commit this nation to war would be unconstitutional as it would be tantamount to usurping an absolute right vested in <Col N="815" /> Dáil Éireann. There was an interesting debate in this House in April 1987 &ndash; Dáil Debates, Vol. 371 Col. 2316 &ndash; when the current Attorney General made these very same points about how Articles 15.6.1º and 28.3.1º protect our neutrality. Those are legal and not political arguments. Whatever their appeal to a fine and well-trained legal mind, I doubt these arguments, no matter how elegant, would carry much weight with the bulk of the Irish people, who know they wish to adhere to a concept of military neutrality and there is at the heart of Irish law at least a silence &ndash; in my view, a vacuum &ndash; on that very issue. Neutrality may not be well defined in law but there is no doubt that, ill-defined though it may be in our basic law, it is valued deeply by the people. Whatever its strict legal provenance, the concept of neutrality has won its way into the hearts and the affections of the people.</P>
    <P>Every constitution is a treaty between a people and themselves. Every constitution enshrines the hopes and aspirations of the nation within its pages. The vast majority of the Irish people wish to live in peace and harmony with the other peoples of the world. The people are suspicious, and rightly so, of military entanglements and alliances. They should be given the opportunity on this occasion to write into their Constitution their commitment to neutrality in clear and in unambiguous terms.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday I raised this issue within my parliamentary party. I was given an undertaking that we will study, by internal arrangements within the next few weeks or months, the issue of neutrality and how it could be better protected in the Constitution. That is a task for all of the parties in this House. I realise that there is a variety of views on this issue. Some, like me, feel that neutrality should be at the very heart of a foreign policy which would be attractive to the people. Others believe &ndash; I respect their right although I disagree with their arguments &ndash; that we should perhaps abandon neutrality at this stage and not just engage in PfP but also join the Western European Union fully and become full members of NATO. The point I am making is that debate has not taken place and it is time it took place.</P>
    <P>Bunreacht na hÉireann, we need to remind ourselves from time to time, does not belong to any group of judges, to academics or to the establishment, nor does it belong to the politicians who hold power at any point. Bunreacht na hÉireann belongs to the people who are the sovereign authority in this Republic. The best service the politicians can do in this matter is give the people the opportunity for a referendum which will allow them to enshrine their views and aspirations on our neutrality in Bunreacht na hÉireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the limited time available to me, I will be as direct as I can about the issue which is before the Dáil. Obviously a debate of 15 minute contributions is not a substitute for a debate on foreign policy. Neither is it a substitute, <Col N="816" /> unfortunately, for a public debate or a referendum or plebiscite which was promised by the main party of Government.</P>
      <P>To use my time correctly, I want to be as blunt as I can. Partnership for Peace and the debate we are having on it represents a unique degradation of language because the debate is not about partnership or peace. Unequivocally, the main beneficiaries of an expanded Partnership for Peace, which was described by the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs as not the creature of NATO but rather the creation of NATO, should have been properly outlined in context which would have included the role of the armaments industry, the role of NATO, the role of NATO in Europe, the balance of PfP as an option in comparison to an expanded NATO, the role of Russia and the relationship of these new structures to issues of North/South which have replaced issues of the Cold War. None of this is taking place and we can now deal with such facts as we are allowed deal with, but there are some facts which are incontrovertible. At present the main beneficiaries of armed bodies and relationships structures is the international armaments industry. I do not have time to go into the detail of the full value of this industry, which is somewhere between $350 billion and $400 billion, 47 per cent of which is produced in the US, but Britain, to its shame, is now ranked second among producers and exporters of armaments. Turkey, a poor country which has an appalling record in relation to the Kurds, for example, became, less than three years ago the second biggest purchaser of arms in the world.</P>
      <P>As I listen to the debate I prefer, rather than getting involved in the constitutional niceties of where precisely our neutrality might be questioned, to make a straight assertion that the beneficiary of this approach to alleged security is the international arms industry. One of the low points of the end of a century and millennium is that arms production and distribution remains something which can hardly be discussed.</P>
      <P>It is a degradation of language to suggest that it is either a partnership or that it is peaceful. It is a degradation of politics that a promise was given to the Irish public that this matter would be debated publicly and that that promise is being broken. It is a degradation of diplomacy that it has now so formally been made secondary and residual to issues of armaments production or, as they might be described by a distinguished Secretary of State in the US, to a theory of interests. Listening here and reading the papers which have been debated, unfortunately I must refer to what has been described as the guide to Partnership for Peace produced by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is more an exercise in moral casuistry than a statement of any moral principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we consider, as Deputy Roche stated, how our action in relation to Partnership for Peace will be perceived. On reading the report of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on the United <Col N="817" /> Nations on peacekeeping enforcement in the light of UN reform, I found it interesting that Ireland's distinguished Ambassador, Mr. Dylan Mahon, referred to the country's influence and stated that the country's individual position is still characterised by the following: peacekeeping; Third World orientation; energetic and objective activity on human rights &ndash; just recently established in the Department &ndash; and positive influence on the EU relative to some nuclear issues and conventional weapons. On the question of UN reform he noted that Ireland paid on time, is active on working groups engaged in reform, favours an enhancement of the General Assembly through the use of charter powers, encourages better communication between the General Assembly and SECO and is active on the question of enlargement and the veto.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dylan Mahon is correct. Our relationship to the world in making a case for peace and security in a new context that is post-Cold War means that we must speak meaningfully if we are to speak about foreign policy and our attitude to Africa, Asia and the countries which are not on that long list but which have specific interest in PfP. We must, as it were, live responsibly in the world and define a foreign policy. Within that policy, we must outline a set of diplomatic practices. However, it seems that we now have a kind of drift which I describe as &ldquo;a degradation&rdquo;. If I was to define it more theoretically, I would state that it is the supremacy of the technocratic over the moral. We are approaching the end of a century where ethics has departed from economics and where moral principles have departed from diplomacy and foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I respect the views of those who may say that in the absence of PfP there is nothing else. What is that but an excuse for an active foreign policy that would have been built on genuine principles of peace and partnership and that would have spoken about the immorality of the deflection of so many human resources from tasks of building peace? The little document on Partnership for Peace contains not one jot about building the mind of peace, erecting peaceful structures or educating for peace. I am deeply saddened by the technocratic drift to which I referred. People have a right to offer their opinion but the debate has been led by those who argue that we need to join PfP in order to continue with essential tasks of peacekeeping. I do not have time to list the many corrections to their arguments. However, I wish people on the Government side had noted, for example, the new Russian position post-Kosovo, namely, that it changed its stance in relation to PfP. Others may wish to correct, but I do not have the time for such detail.</P>
    <P>In the September issue of <i>European Issues</i> a contributor ended his long article by stating that Europe will lose its patience with us, that Ireland is a dependent economy and that PfP is part of our participation in Europe. What is this all about? Has anyone suggested that the Irish Defence Forces personnel who made 46,000 indi<Col N="818" /> vidual trips abroad in the interests of peacekeeping needed PfP? I contend that they did not need it. Is anyone suggesting, for example, that we would not be able to continue to involve ourselves in peacekeeping missions? It has been half suggested that we need information in order to make our troops secure and that we need better equipment etc. These are separate issues. Our Defence Forces have an admirable record. I support their activities and they should be properly equipped. However, this is quite different from advocating membership of PfP.</P>
    <P>Against whom is PfP designed to defend us? In the United States, the debate about PfP is divided between those who are isolationist, to some extent, and who feel that America has paid too great a price for securing Europe, those who argue that it should reach a different accommodation with Russia and a group of people who believe that the creation of an entity such as PfP manages to fudge the issue in the absence of policy. Let us be clear, PfP was created by NATO in 1994. The application in respect of PfP was processed by the Secretary General of NATO, who also chairs the related consultative body.</P>
    <P>In joining PfP we will do something that is peculiarly regarded as convincing the world about that moment in our history when we were supposed to be neutral, namely, World War II. Again, time constraints will not permit me to elaborate on this. However, there is such a concept as positive neutrality that is not fudged by the sort of casuistry to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The timing of our entry to Partnership for Peace is important. There is a kind of arrogance involved in this regard. I recall campaigning in the 1980s for the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign policy so that we could discuss foreign policy in the Oireachtas. I was informed at the time that this was a form of &ldquo;high activity&rdquo; which could not be understood by the average Deputy or Senator. Such a committee now exists but the people of Ireland are being disqualified from debating the issues surrounding entry to PfP which has the net effect of breaking a promise to them.</P>
    <P>Let me make my position perfectly clear. Not only am I voting against the galloping of this motion through the Dáil, but if there had been a referendum I would have voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I would have done so because of my belief in the importance of our having an engaged and active foreign policy. As an elected representative, I find it offensive to be informed by some people that the Army knows best. The Army is in possession of some of but not all the information and it is quite outrageous to dislodge the political opinion of Members of the Oireachtas and the people by those writing from a position of experience who believe that the structures from which a country appropriates its enhanced military capacity are irrelevant. We are faced with an economics without ethics and a foreign policy without moral principles. That is a degrading position in which to find ourselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> I return to Mr. Dylan Mahon's evidence to the sub-committee on the United Nations that we would be going with a great bag to gather up the votes for our membership of the Security Council. Why do we want to join the Security Council? Ireland was a member of that council on a previous occasion when it received the support of the Latin American nations. That was a proud moment in our history and we attracted great respect. I recall that Noel Dorr was Ireland's permanent representative at the UN during that period. Will we be respected if we continue to state, &ldquo;We were dependent and we could not afford to do anything different&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Let us be clear, we are substituting a kind of logic of technocratic drift for the formation of policy. We correctly use language developed elsewhere such as &ldquo;the new architecture of foreign policy&rdquo;. Within this new architecture, what is to be the role of the UN? The misquotation of Kofi Annan's position, even in the document circulated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is outrageous. I challenge the Department in that regard. Kofi Annan's speech on regional initiatives referred to the United Nations building peace and relying more and more on taking regional initiatives. The historic example of Namibia in Africa comes to mind in that regard and I could provide further examples. There is not one jot of proof that Kofi Annan ever suggested that NATO is the regional authority for Europe, its periphery and beyond. The misquotation to which I refer is simply outrageous.</P>
    <P>Given our anxiety to be members of the Security Council, I thought we would have been discussing UN reform and the extension of the moral authority of the UN, global citizenry and interdependency. However, the Government's case in respect of this issue contains another little demeaning exercise. In the last paragraph of his contribution, the Minister stated that it is time to put an end to our isolationism. When were we isolationists? Some of us have worked all our lives on dealing with human rights cases, famine etc. abroad.</P>
    <P>We do not need a lecture &ndash; I am surprised to hear one from a friend of mine, Deputy Andrews, with whom I shared many working experiences abroad in the past &ndash; to the effect that, somehow or other, joining PfP is macho, modern and international and that those who oppose this view are either traditionalists or internationalists. That is codswallop. Joining PfP without a debate is an outrageous, anti-democratic exercise in unthinking logical drift to a position where we are simply saying that we count for very little. The best argument I have heard today &ndash; I have listened to almost the entire debate &ndash; is that we cannot afford to be anywhere else. May the Lord help us if all we can bring to foreign policy is the notion that membership of PfP will be a great opportunity &ndash;&ldquo;wonderful opportunity, smart lad wanted&rdquo;. Ireland in PfP will be able to play the <Col N="820" /> military games with the best of them. This is Ireland's foreign policy in 1999. It is rather sad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude now. This is a NATO initiative, proposed by the United States in October 1993 as a substitute for seeking new members for NATO. In May 1995 Russia revised its membership. It is part of NATO's membership action plan. As a process and as a signifier it is the beginning of the end of a period of enormous potential influence for Ireland. We might have built security in terms of the deflection of arms production from tasks of war to tasks of peace. With the greatest sadness I say that Ireland's role in deflecting the production of armaments and their distribution is incredibly damaged by this action and, more than that, our allies and friends and those in the international community who admired us will no longer see us as giving moral leadership but as a little bit of something that is standing there temporarily. They will see that we did not have the courage to say that Europe would take on the international role of security co-ordinator. Rather than doing that, we have had an affair with the ghost of NATO and its wonderful recent record of collateral damage of civilians and smart bombs.</P>

      <P>One would not have thought such a benign title as Partnership for Peace could generate such fear and anger but Deputy Higgins has made it clear that it does. He describes Partnership for Peace as a degradation, and maybe he is right. I understand why people may experience such fear and anger and question the rightness of the journey we are about to undertake. I asked questions similar to those posed by Deputy Higgins at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting last March when this issue was first discussed.</P>
      <P>No matter how the matter is interpreted, my understanding of my party's election manifesto is that Fianna Fáil gave a commitment to hold a referendum on this issue. We are now told by the current Attorney General and his predecessor that there is no necessity to hold a referendum. That may be the legal position but it does not detract from the fact that we gave a commitment and we are now doing an about face. This does not, and will not, serve us well. Deputy Roche's proposals are worthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued at the parliamentary party meeting last March that regardless of whether a refer<Col N="821" /> endum is required it would be possible to hold a plebiscite to ascertain the view of the electorate on the issue. This is done in other states. This is done on a yearly, if not twice yearly, basis in Switzerland although the Swiss did not hold a plebiscite on this issue. The opposing argument is that Governments are elected to govern and we should not refer to the electorate every time we must make a decision. I do not believe we should, except when we make decisions of the magnitude of this one. I admit that I do not fully comprehend the magnitude of this decision. History will judge people like myself who have come full circle on this issue. I see much merit in ascertaining the views of the public in a plebiscite. Previous constitutional referendums did not allow the reasoned and informed debate which Deputy Higgins wishes to see but nevertheless a plebiscite would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>It is notable and right that Deputy Higgins is not in step with his own party on this issue. The White Paper which was published in 1996, when he was in Government, recommended that we join PfP. There can be diversity of views within parties. We must respect this diversity and I respect Deputy Higgins's view.</P>
    <P>I do not have a definition of Irish neutrality. Recent opinion polls in <i>The Irish Times </i>showed 69 per cent of people absolutely favouring neutrality. However, 57 per cent of those people favoured Ireland making a commitment to defend another member state. I share this ambivalence. Is membership of PfP compatible with our policy of positive neutrality, whatever that is? We might define positive neutrality as allowing the Dáil to make the ultimate decision regarding military involvement on behalf of the Irish people on a case by case basis. We saw this happen last week in relation to our involvement in East Timor. If we follow this policy of allowing the Dáil to make such decisions we must accept that the Dáil represents the views of the people. At the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting, Deputy Roche proposed that the debate on Ireland's neutrality begin immediately and that the constitutional review group, of which I am a member, should examine the question of holding a referendum on Ireland's neutrality. We need to know what we mean by neutrality. The opinion poll published in <i>The Irish Times </i>reveals that we do not know what we mean by it.</P>
    <P>The issue of armaments causes great concern. Deputy Michael O'Kennedy spoke at length to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party about the armaments industry in the same tone as Deputy Higgins. The Minister has stated that there is reference to the armaments industry in the Partnership for Peace presentation document. I would not wish to see Ireland become a party to something which fuels this disgusting industry. I recently visited Lebanon with a cross-party group and during the course of that visit the need for equipment became obvious. Armoured personnel carriers are expensive, but our soldiers needed them every morning as they swept the Israeli <Col N="822" /> occupied area for landmines. An argument can understandably be made against the arms industry, but equipment is needed by our army to provide humanitarian assistance and to participate in peacekeeping missions.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Higgins's confusion about the distinction between Ireland's participation in UN peacekeeping missions and involvement in PfP. We are told that increasingly such operations will be carried out by regional organisations. I want further clarification on why it is necessary to change the manner in which these operations were conducted previously, but those who know better have decided this is the way to proceed. Ireland's participation in PfP will be decided on a case by case basis and I welcome that because at least we are not signing up to something which could get out of control and commit us to all missions.</P>
    <P>There is a widely held perception among those opposed to PfP that it will damage Ireland's neutrality. All the other neutral EU member states have signed up to it, but I am not sure if Ireland has defined what &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; means. That is probably where the debate should have commenced before it was agreed to sign up to PfP. Perhaps we should have engaged more with the public about its perception of neutrality. If, however, it were necessary to hold a referendum on PfP, the public would probably have signed up to it based on the experiences of the Irish Army abroad.</P>
    <P>When this issue was first debated by the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, I recounted my experience of the day in 1960 when the first Irish troops travelled to the Congo with the UN and the near euphoria of the people on O'Connell Street as they saw them off. My father was a member of the medical corps and there was a great sense of Ireland being a small nation fighting for the rights of people who were treated badly. The following Christmas, however, there was panic in the Army married quarters, where I lived, when it was reported that Irish soldiers were missing. I was aged six at the time and many young families lived in the barracks. While the adults attempted to conceal what was happening from the children, we picked up on the fear among the women that their husbands might have been killed in the Niemba ambush. As it transpired, my father, thankfully, was not killed but many of his friends were.</P>
    <P>I epitomise the ambivalence of the people who want to see our neutrality retained and I never want to see Irish troops participating in an offensive mission. It is accepted that they will protect and defend on peacekeeping missions but, unfortunately, soldiers are killed on such missions. During Ireland's first peacekeeping mission, we had the most horrific experience where the largest number of soldiers ever was killed abroad. History will judge us on whether we did the right thing. I do not know if anybody will say the mission to the Congo in the 1960s was wrong, but it was heartbreaking for those who lost fathers and <Col N="823" /> brothers. Having had the opportunity as a Member of this House to visit Cambodia and the Lebanon, and despite my own family experience, I will make a leap of faith. I hope Ireland will not be involved in an offensive military alliance but continue to engage in peacekeeping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to participate in the debate. It was a pleasure to listen to Deputy Higgins's contribution, although I come from the other side of the argument and would not be able to express myself as eloquently. The time and effort he put in to establishing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will always stand to him and all of us should not have to debate Irish foreign policy in 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>This issue is critical to the development of our foreign policy into the next millennium. However, I fully support the clear and honest way Fine Gael has led the debate on membership of PfP. The debate is in the public arena since 1996 and one reason put forward by the people and organisations that oppose Ireland's membership is that the public is not fully informed of the advantages or disadvantages of PfP. The debate has been to the forefront of public consciousness for only a number of months. The majority of people are not interested while the remainder have participated in the debate.</P>
      <P>The aspect of PfP most widely debated is whether we should hold a referendum on membership of the organisation. I share Fine Gael's view that it is not necessary. We, as Members of this House, are elected to legislate and to make decisions for the common good on behalf of those who vote for us. I have no difficulty standing over the decision that Ireland should join PfP and I will answer the people I represent over the next number of years. If they have a difficulty with my decision on this issue, I will argue my case and I am confident they will believe I made this decision in good faith and in the best interest of the country.</P>
      <P>The most cynical aspect of this debate is the manner in which Fianna Fáil dealt with it while in Opposition. I heard Deputies Roche and McGennis state that a promise was made and I realise that we all have difficulties with U-turns. When he was leader of the Opposition, while debating the White Paper on Foreign Policy, the Taoiseach made this statement in the Dáil:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>PfP involves joint exercises with NATO on sea or land. Will they take place in Ireland? Will we be able to choose the NATO countries with whom we wish to have exercises? Will we have British troops back in the Curragh, the French in Bantry Bay, the Germans on Banna Strand, the Spanish in Kinsale and the Americans in Lough Foyle? Is that what we are talking about, or will we take part in exercises abroad under NATO command?.We would regard any attempt to push Partnership for Peace or participation in Western European <Col N="824" /> Union tasks by resolution through this House without reference to the people who under our Constitution have the right &ldquo;in final to appeal to decide on all questions of national policy&rdquo;, as a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic.</P>
    <P>Those words speak for themselves and that is the issue. We are discussing a serious foreign policy issue and we have all seen the difficulties it has caused, with Members of this House being held in low esteem by the public because party leaders come into this House, make such statements and then enter Government to upend such statements by saying there is no need for a referendum. I was amazed to hear Deputy Bertie Ahern talk about British troops back in the Curragh. That is not politics, it is hype; it does not deal with the issues involved. That cynicism is what leaves the bad taste in the mouths of the public.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that Fianna Fáil is the only party which has made a U-turn. We are all to blame but we must think about what we say here. We cannot be irresponsible. The major issue which concerns people is why there is not a referendum on the issue, they are not worried about joining Partnership for Peace. They are willing to be led by the legislators but not by those who came into this House three years ago to state that there would be a referendum and who are now in a position to put that referendum in place but are not willing to do so or to explain why. That is a major difficulty.</P>
    <P>An argument used against membership of Partnership for Peace is that it involves us in activities with states possessing nuclear weapons. The reality is that Irish peace keepers over many years have served, and continue to serve, with peace keepers from France, Britain, the USA and Russia, all of which possess nuclear weapons. That is a spurious argument which cannot stand up.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputies Roche and McGennis when they spoke about the meaning of neutrality. During the Second World War, Seán Lemass said that Ireland was neutral on the side of the Allies. In pragmatic terms that was true. We have not had an explanation of what neutrality means to this country now. I agree with Deputy Roche that the definition of neutrality is a major issue which will face this country and a decision which the people and the legislators will have to make to see how our foreign policy will work in the new millennium.</P>
    <P>We have been members of the European Union since 1973 and we have seen the vast funding which was given to the country by the European Union. We have seen the massive improvements membership has made to our infrastructure, helping us to create economic success which is the envy of many countries. If we are willing to participate in economic and monetary union we must be willing to defend this union. We cannot have it both ways, we cannot enjoy the fruits of monetary union with access to the largest economic bloc in the world, or act as a base for other countries which want access to that <Col N="825" /> bloc, without participating in the defence of that union if such a need should ever arise. There will be heated arguments but this is a debate which must take place and one in which all people in this country have a legitimate right to participate. We need to deal with it sooner rather than later. It is time to look at our neutrality; it is not the sacred cow it once was. If we wish to participate fully in economic and monetary union, we must participate in its defence.</P>
    <P>Many people have a difficulty with our joining Partnership for Peace because of its close links with NATO. It has been stated that the next step after membership of Partnership for Peace is membership of NATO. NATO has its difficulties, particularly those caused by the arms industry for Third World countries, countries which spend more on purchasing weapons than feeding and educating their populations. The history of NATO must, however, be taken into consideration. Since the establishment of NATO, millions of people have not been murdered on this continent as happened in the First and Second World Wars. NATO has done some good things. The UN carries out excellent peace keeping missions in which this country has proudly participated, and we have an enviable record, but the difficulties in Kosovo and Bosnia were responded to by NATO while the UN was found to be unable to respond as quickly as was necessary. East Timor is another example. People were appalled at the murder and mayhem in those places and were appalled that the international community stood by, waiting for someone to make a move.</P>
    <P>The UN is hamstrung because it is not receiving funding. The UN cannot be the peacekeepers of the world if finance is not available and it cannot put in peacekeeping missions throughout the world. A major issue for the United Nations is rehabilitation to enable it respond much quicker. NATO responded, but not fast enough for the majority of us, and are doing very good work in the countries I have named. Being closely associated with NATO is the major disadvantage being portrayed by those who are anti our membership of partnership for peace.</P>
    <P>Our membership of partnership for peace was described by some of my colleagues as like an <i>a la carte</i> menu where you can decide what parts of partnership for peace you want to participate in. It is not a treaty, the country can leave it at any stage. If membership is causing difficulties, the country can decide. The question of membership of partnership for peace is not as serious as that stated by those opposed to it.</P>
    <P>This is a good thing for our Army. In recent years we have seen how the armed forces have been demoralised. They have been excellent in peacekeeping duties throughout the world. Joining partnership for peace would boost morale in the Army. That alone would be of benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate so far has centred on three main issues, none of which appears to consider the PfP concept or to clarify the position in <Col N="826" /> the public mind. The issues focused on are neutrality, whether or not there ought to be a referendum and the question of the pre-election promises in the manifesto. On the question of neutrality there has been an extremely important debate on this occasion which contrasts quite sharply with the debate which took place when the White Paper on foreign policy was discussed about two years ago. Certainly it is much more passionate and people are adopting stronger positions than one would have anticipated. There is a good deal of confusion about what this neutrality means. There is confusion about the concept and about the reality. Nonetheless there is in the Irish psyche a leaning towards the concept of neutrality and a belief that it is a respectable concept and one which places us in a strong position internationally and in a good moral position. It is no harm that the concept and the reality of neutrality is considered in those terms but, more particularly in practical terms, in the context of where we stand in relation to foreign policy. The concept of positive neutrality is tossed about. Nobody has illustrated what they mean by that, nor has anybody said what they might mean by negative or neutral neutrality. It seems the concept is, in some senses, at a surreal level. At the back of our minds none of us can help thinking that we are not planning on attacking anybody in the immediate future, we are not planning to jump in on one side or the other in any of the armed conflicts which are taking place. However that is not a reason for walking away from considering where we stand. In the lazy mind and in the mind which likes the easy-fix there is an inclination to do that. Virtually all speakers so far have added to the debate in this area. From what I have read about partnership for peace there would seem to be very little reason the neutrality debate ought to become central to the debate on PfP.</P>
      <P>The referendum issue has grabbed the public imagination much more than any other element. That is extraordinary. We have had a series of referenda over decades where people had almost to be driven to the polls to cast their votes. They have treated referenda with a level of boredom, contempt and lack of interest that is hard to exaggerate and understand. I have no reason, nor has anybody given me one, to believe that if there had been a referendum on partnership for peace there would have been more interest, or more illuminated public debate on the issue. In relation to referenda, there is the question of whether a referendum must be held. It is clear that if the legal advice states that the Constitution is being altered a referendum is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an interesting sub-debate on whether referenda might be held on other issues that might not require a referendum in terms of the legal advice available. We should not necessarily say that, just because the legal advice says one should not have a referendum, we should not have one. There may well be issues where the public interest is so great that there would be a <Col N="827" /> decent turn-out and it would encourage a level of public participation in policy which we have not so far seen. We do not see it in general elections or in referenda dealing with our membership of the European Union. The Amsterdam Treaty, and the Maastricht Treaty which made fundamental and far-reaching changes in Ireland's position were entered into and endorsed by the people in a state of confusion and disinterest with the disinterest outweighing the confusion by 70:1. I am astounded that the referendum element has become a central issue. One can understand the neutrality issue would come into the debate.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has taken the trouble to go beyond the carefully extracted brief excerpts from speeches made here and outside by the Taoiseach and others and examine what was said would have a different view to that represented by many speakers on the Opposition benches. The concept of partnership for peace has changed very much since its inception. Some people may have had reason to be suspicious about what was originally proposed. However, there have been far reaching changes since that time in relation to what PfP means. Much of the concern relating to the election manifesto issue was that this was another election promise being broken. If the full story was told it would be quite as stark and would not be like that. If any group in society needs to be conscious of its image in the public mind it is surely politicians. Many of us need to look at behaviour in Opposition as well as in Government  in terms of how it serves the national good, and I am not referring just to the people currently in Opposition. We need to be more careful with what we say and how we represent the issues of the day. As politicians, we frequently make the mistake of thinking the people are not as smart as they appear but ultimately they see through much of what goes on.</P>
    <P>Since the debate has become embroiled in the area of neutrality, and since the concept of Partnership for Peace has assumed proportions which do not appear to be justified by what is involved, we have been forced to examine aspects of our foreign policy that perhaps we have not done often enough in the past. One of the questions that concerns us and the people outside the House is the standing of the United Nations and its failure, in many important fora, to address the issues involved. Part of that concern relates to the Security Council and the appalling record of certain countries, some of which are friends of Ireland, in their obligations to finance the United Nations. Nobody can be impressed with the standing of the United Nations and with its moral position as a custodian of international law. That important aspect of the debate is worthy of consideration. Many of the organisations we do not like, including NATO, could be more easily dispensed with if the UN had the standing we would all like.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the production and sale of armaments. It is a fact that otherwise civi<Col N="828" /> lised countries, many of which are among our friends internationally, have an appalling record in this regard. Nobody can fault us as individual parliamentarians or as an Oireachtas for taking every opportunity to decry the appalling human suffering which ensues from the international armaments industry. There is a moral role for Ireland in international and foreign policy which must be stated clearly and frequently. We tend to underestimate the value of a strong moral position Ireland has tried to hold on all of these issues. What can be dismissed as righteous indignation, frequently expressed strongly by individuals and nations elsewhere, can make a difference.</P>
    <P>The Partnership for Peace debate has been tied up on three other issues. It is fair to say the public relations battle with regard to Partnership for Peace has been lost by the movers of the motion, and some ground needs to be made up. The responsibility for making up that ground does not rest solely with the Department of Foreign Affairs or with the Government. It is important that people with strong views should present them in a truthful way and not add to them to improve their own political position.</P>
    <P>I take comfort from the strong position of the Minister, Deputy Andrews, on many issues in the past year or so. He has established a level of personal credibility in this House, in the Fianna Fáil Party and in the international arena which has been good for Ireland, and that should not be overlooked in the debate. On the other hand, those presenting the arguments in favour of Partnership for Peace who introduced the spurious armed forces element, the need to re-equip, and so on, should have another look at the matter because it does not add to the strength of the case.</P>
    <P>The central question in relation to Ireland's foreign policy is, who shapes it? Who should shape it? What is the role of this House? Much mention has been made of the foreign affairs committee which does tremendous work, but is that work reflected in our foreign policy position? Our position would be stronger if that were the case. I mentioned already the example of the debate on the White Paper on Foreign Policy which was a great deal less passionate and considerably less illuminating than the debate on this issue, and I listened to virtually every speaker since the debate started. There is a view that because there are only six or seven Deputies in the House at a time, nobody else has any involvement or knows what is going on. I frequently take the opportunity to say that is not the case. Virtually every Member follows the debates in the House closely. People will be surprised to know that almost everybody has a good idea of what everybody else said, yet there is a view that we escape to a place of comfort and entertainment while four or five people keep the House going. That does not serve well the role of the politician in the public mind. We are slow to drive home <Col N="829" /> the point that people are serious about their business and following what is going on in the House.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the concept of technocratic drift as outlined by Deputy Michael D. Higgins. Central to that concept is the question of foreign policy, who should shape it and the reason so much of it is in the drift he mentioned. In some sense it might be a vague concept but it is central to where civilisation might be going or where it might direct itself. In outlining the constitutional position on neutrality, Deputy Roche put to bed the view of many people that there is no constitutional position. While the word is not given a direct meaning in the Constitution, several provisions have a bearing on issues such as neutrality, some of which might have had a bearing on this issue, but I tend to accept the advice of two Attorneys General in relation to it, although other speakers have a valid case when they question it.</P>
    <P>From the outset many of the contributions have been insightful and passionate and illustrated the genuine moral dilemmas for many people on issues such as this. It is important to state that Partnership for Peace is a voluntary framework. Participation in PfP is very different from participation in NATO. I know some people have concerns about the headquarters, the secretariat and matters of that nature but many people who had such concerns two or three years ago are much more comfortable with the concept of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council which this country intends to join. That concept relates more closely to the position in which many of us would wish to be placed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate on the various aspects of the issue and clarity in relation to what is involved would be extremely helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>This decision on PfP membership is one of the most important and far-reaching ever to be made in this House. Any attempt to try to present it as only a small extension of Ireland's peacekeeping role and as having nothing to do with either our neutrality or with the nuclear alliance, NATO, must be resisted. The Green Party is an internationalist party. We strongly support an active and positive neutrality, dedicated to the peaceful settlement of international disputes through the United Nations only and not through NATO, the NATO-led PfP or any NATO linked EU defence body now being devised in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The people of Ireland and future generations will not thank this Government or certain Opposition Deputies for the half truths they have put forward on PfP. They will not thank them or Fine Gael for denying the people the right to be heard on this issue, the right to a referendum. I have no doubt that both the denial of this basic democratic right and joining of PfP will come back to haunt this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is this decision historic, so is Fianna Fáil's U-turn. Deputy Bertie Ahern's scathing <Col N="830" /> comments on NATO's PfP while in Opposition&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>He must be referred to as &ldquo;the Taoiseach&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon. The Taoiseach's scathing comments on NATO's PfP while in Opposition, and the hollow Fianna Fáil election manifesto promises to never join PfP, are now infamous. However, the size of this U-turn has caught even many of the Fianna Fáil faithful by surprise, with disquiet, not only in the grass roots, but also on the Fianna Fáil backbenches. The Taoiseach's renowned brass neck is well suited for his new military role. His first action will be to march his soldiers of destiny, not just through the &lsquo;yes' lobby, but into the ranks of NATO. We will be quite literally in the lobbies of NATO, as this Presentation Document commits Irish military personnel to being permanently based in NATO headquarters.</P>
      <P>PfP is a support structure for NATO. To try to fob it off as the Salvation Army or the Red Cross, involved in solely humanitarian actions, is simply wrong, and the Government knows that. PfP was founded to assist NATO expansion, to give NATO a new lease of life after the Cold War. President Clinton has called it &ldquo;A path to full NATO membership for some and a strong lasting link to the Alliance for all&rdquo;. The Green Party and the majority of Irish people find neither of those options acceptable.</P>
      <P>Why is Ireland now proposing to assist the expansion of NATO, a military bloc based on nuclear weapons and a nuclear defence policy found illegal under humanitarian law by the International Court of Justice at the Hague? For the Government to now commit us in this Presentation Document to conducting humanitarian exercises with NATO is quite bizarre.</P>
      <P>The PfP and this Presentation Document go far beyond humanitarian co-operation. The PfP framework document, which the Government and all PfP members sign &ndash; and which this House, apparently, will not discuss &ndash; is open-ended about the types of missions which PfP members might perform with NATO, and emphasises the need for armed forces to be properly equipped to operate alongside NATO. The Presentation Document we have before us is also open-ended. It states: &ldquo;The following is an indication of areas of general interest for Ireland in the PfP framework&rdquo;. That is quite vague. Highlighting peacekeeping, humanitarian, search and rescue, and co-operation on the environment and marine matters has diverted attention from other aspects of this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, we are now committed to the development of military interoperability with NATO, and the enormous arms expenditure that goes with it. At last week's PDFORRA conference, quotes of £200 million were cited, for starters, and there have been estimates in the billions. This will be another boost for the arms <Col N="831" /> trade. There are better ways to spend this money. We could spend it on child care, schools, hospitals, housing, disability, public transport and on helping the developing world and alleviating the reasons for conflict in those areas. Considering the armaments that will be required in the PfP, references in section 5 of the Presentation Document to Ireland's commitment to disarmament ring rather hollow. PfP is directed at armaments, not disarmament. The arms manufacturers are having a field day.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that Irish officers will serve in NATO headquarters in Brussels and in the Partnership Co-ordination Cell, PCC, in Mons, Belgium. What will these officers do? The PCC is under the authority of NATO's North Atlantic Council and co-ordinates PfP military activities with NATO staff, commands and agencies. Officers from PfP countries are allowed work alongside their NATO counterparts in NATO's military structure &ndash; so-called partnership staff elements. Are Irish officers intending to do this?</P>
    <P>There is provision for a limited training area. This means NATO troops could now exercise on Irish territory, a vista the Taoiseach so eloquently put before this House while in Opposition, when he asked: &ldquo;Will we have British troops back in the Curragh, the French in Bantry Bay, the Germans on Banna Strand, the Spanish in Kinsale and the Americans in Lough Foyle?&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the RUC in Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps. The Taoiseach might like to answer his own question, since he is now, in effect, inviting foreign troops into Ireland.</P>
      <P>There will be co-operation, not just in peacekeeping, but in &ldquo;peace support&rdquo; and &ldquo;crisis management&rdquo; operations as well. This is a blank cheque proviso, allowing Irish troops to become involved in a full array of military exercises with NATO. Both peace support and crisis management involve enforcement. Anyone doubting this, can check NATO's own logistics handbook, which defines peace support operations as including &ldquo;peacemaking&rdquo;. Section 19 of the Presentation Document states Ireland will participate in and host, among others, &ldquo;exercises associated with peace support operations&rdquo;. Basically, the door is now open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In what sort of exercises will Irish troops be involved? Earlier this year, the Government actively considered participating in a PfP operation &ndash; without being a member of PfP &ndash; called BALTOPS 99. NATO has defined BALTOPS as &ldquo;a series of multilateral training exercises in air warfare, shallow water undersea warfare, electronic warfare, air defence, surface warfare, communications, fast patrol boat operations, seamanship and mine warfare&rdquo;. No doubt, if Ireland is a member of PfP next year, it will participate in this, under the guise of exercising in &ldquo;fast patrol boat operations&rdquo; or &ldquo;seamanship&rdquo;. <Col N="832" /> However, it is a war exercise &ndash; this is about war games.</P>
    <P>Under this agreement, Ireland will join the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, EAPC, and the Planning and Review Process, PARP, in which we will consult NATO on military matters. The PARP process is integrated into NATO's defence planning and identifies &ldquo;forces and capabilities which might be made available for multinational training, exercises and operations in conjunction with Alliance forces&rdquo;. The EAPC document states that among the &ldquo;specific subject areas on which Allies and Partners would consult&rdquo; would be nuclear issues &ndash; proliferation and defence &ndash; as well as defence strategy and policy. Therefore, the claims by the Minister, Deputy Andrews, that this has nothing to do with nuclear deterrents are bogus.</P>
    <P>We have not been given much information in this House about these bodies we are about to join. It is very instructive to see what was said at NATO's Washington summit in April. The EAPC Heads of State and Government endorsed a number of documents, including, first, a &ldquo;Political-Military Framework for NATO-led PfP Operations&rdquo;, emphasising &ldquo;its importance to the growing operational role of the Partnership&rdquo;; second, a report &ldquo;Towards a Partnership for the 21st Century &ndash; The Enhanced and more Operational Partnership&rdquo;, which sets out the main elements of the more operational PfP, including &ldquo;enhanced defence-related and military co-operation&rdquo;; and, third, an &ldquo;Operational Capabilities Concept for NATO-led PfP Operations&rdquo;, which the EAPC states &ldquo;will be further developed to reinforce PfP's operational capabilities, thereby improving the ability of Alliance and Partner forces to operate together in future&rdquo;. Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State, addressing the EAPC summit, welcomed the fact that we are &ldquo;increasingly planning and exercising together in preparation for possible future missions&rdquo;. This is the club that Ireland will join.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Roche, who spoke about the so-called neutral members. These are referred to in the US Congress as &ldquo;the former neutrals&rdquo;. Members should make no mistake &ndash; their neutrality has been eroded through membership of the PfP. Deputy Roche also put forward the idea of a constitutional amendment, which would enshrine Irish neutrality. He is simply flying a kite and is being entirely disingenuous. I proposed such an amendment at the time of the Amsterdam Treaty. It was rejected by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and, unfortunately, the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the links between NATO's PfP and the EU's &ldquo;Petersberg Tasks&rdquo; have been admitted to in both this Presentation Document and the Government's explanatory guide. The Government failed to acknowledge these links during the Amsterdam Treaty referendum. Why was that? At its summit in Washington in April, NATO offered its &ldquo;collective assets and capabilities&rdquo; to the EU for the Petersberg Tasks and to <Col N="833" /> further the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy. The Government's PfP explanatory guide says that this NATO offer:</P>
    <P>will entail increased co-operation involving NATO, the Western European Union and the European Union. For those EU states which are not members of NATO, PfP is likely to be a principal point of contact with NATO in this connection, in particular as regards the planning for the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>The impression given is that we have no choice. If the Petersberg Tasks are to work, Ireland must also join PfP. The EU's summit in Cologne in June has further hastened this militarisation.</P>
    <P>The Green Party firmly believes that this undemocratic push to join PfP is inextricably linked to the military commitments in the Amsterdam Treaty which the Greens so strongly warned against, and just as we were misled about Amsterdam, we are now being totally misled about Partnership for Peace. The presentation document says that Ireland is a neutral country and &ldquo;does not intend&rdquo; to become a member of NATO. The Green Party is very uncomfortable with the choice of words. It should be remembered that the Taoiseach did not intend joining Partnership for Peace either. He was stronger than that, he said we would not join. Why does this document not state that Ireland will never become a member of NATO?</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about the game plan of NATO and PfP. The best explanatory guide to PfP came not from the Government last spring but from PfP's architects. William Perry was the US Secretary of Defence under President Clinton from 1994 to 1997, and Ashton Carter was Assistant Secretary of Defence. In their recently published book, <i>Preventive Defence</i>, they explain NATO's new role: &ldquo;NATO's principal strategic and military purpose in the post-cold war era is to provide a mechanism for the rapid formation of military potent &lsquo;coalitions of the willing' able to project power beyond NATO territory.&rdquo;  They go on to say that the experience of partnership should be &ldquo;as close as possible in practical military terms to the experience of membership in NATO&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All this clearly shows that our neutrality is being severely undermined. We have already conducted thousands of PfP exercises with and on behalf of the real partnership for peace, the United Nations. Irish troops are the epitome of effective UN peacekeepers. Our troops are and continue to be accepted throughout the world as impartial peacekeepers serving the UN and its universal interests, not the special interests of NATO or a militarised EU.</P>
    <P>It is shameful that Fine Gael has allowed the Government to do this U-turn. The position of the Labour Party is strange and ambivalent. It now wants a referendum but did not want one when in Government. It is now split on PfP but supported it while in Government. The Labour Party leader still supports PfP and has admitted <Col N="834" /> this in the Dáil. The Labour Party, while expressing concern about NATO and nuclear weapons, fully supports the European army, an army which will inevitably be linked with NATO and based on nuclear weapons. I would like to know how the French and British nuclear deterrents will be dismantled. When the history of this time is written, this decision to join PfP will be seen as momentous and wrong. Much is being betrayed, but the greatest betrayal of all is of the people and the democracy upon which the country was founded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened carefully to all the arguments about Partnership for Peace and analysed the views sincerely held by those on both sides, my position is one of support for the Government, albeit with some reservations. The debate on Partnership for Peace has been extensive and well documented and I commend the Minister and his Department on the production of the booklet, <i>Ireland and the Partnership for Peace</i>. It contains all the information required, answers many questions, clears doubts and paints a clear picture of the position to anyone interested in the debate or who wants to learn about the position.</P>
      <P>I have also considered the argument about the need for a referendum. Many contributions to the debate raised this issue and the commitment said to have been given in the previous general election. I do not consider this decision on Partnership for Peace to be one which cannot be made by the Dáil. Therefore, there is no need for a referendum in this regard. The process upon which we have embarked in this debate is the correct one. Page 24, paragraph 66 states:</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's advice is that there is no legal reason why a referendum would be required prior to Irish participation in PfP. PfP, which focuses on cooperation for peacekeeping and humanitarian activities, and has no mutual defence commitments, is not in conflict with our neutrality...has no implications for Irish sovereignty. PfP does not cut across the constitutional prerogative of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the debate, that is my assessment. I also accept the Minister's position that he has changed his position in light of facts and changed circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The harsh reality is that, in a world where so much progress has been made, mankind still needs arms and has developed those to the point where large numbers of people can now be destroyed at the press of a button. Furthermore, the development and use of these arms depends to a substantial extent on the use of uranium, which is harmful in many ways. These weapons affect not only those against whom they are used but also generations of blameless people and even those who produce and use the weapons. I am also mindful that a build-up in military might by any one party usually encourages another party to seek parity. However, it is useless to <Col N="835" /> deny there is evil in the world. There are military dictatorships run by people whose stability and commitment to even basic principles of justice can be questioned. Some of those have nuclear capability, more are acquiring it and none of them should have it.</P>
    <P>Against this backdrop of war, conflict and crises of one kind or other, there is Ireland's position as a peacekeeping force which is recognised worldwide and respected for its policy of involvement in peacekeeping activities and its policy of neutrality. These positions on peacekeeping and neutrality are recognised and respected worldwide. In a developing world moving forward at an ever-increasing speed, we must keep our peacekeeping operations and skills up to date. Partnership for Peace offers all that is needed in this area and, at the same time, allows Ireland to tailor its involvement and contribution to the cause of world peace. Page 21, paragraph 57 of the Government's explanatory guide states:</P>
    <P>PfP is explicitly anchored in the principles of the UN Charter and the OSCE. Participation in PfP does not entail membership of NATO, nor any Alliance commitments.</P>
    <P>Each participating state decides on the scope of its own participation. It is true that a minority of the States participating in PfP are applicants to join NATO. Equally, it is clear that other States, including our fellow European neutrals, see PfP as a means of enhancing outreach to countries such as Russia, and as a means of co-operating in the peacekeeping and crisis management areas.</P>
    <P>That is significant in our approach to Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this is only the thin edge of the wedge in relation to NATO and I understand that position, but the &ldquo;thin edge of the wedge&rdquo; argument can be used in any situation. It is up to us and the other members of PfP to ensure that the hidden agenda and the thin edge of the wedge, if they exist at all, never become more than that. Partnership for Peace must not become more than its user-friendly name implies. I, for one, will be on my feet in this House if it does.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the backdrop of conflict throughout the world, there is a need for a well skilled peace force. Partnership for Peace fulfils this role. Everywhere we look we can see controls over injustice and crime, but these are almost meaningless unless taken on a worldwide basis. The EU demonstrated that principle in its approach to fraud. We cannot and should not avoid making a wholehearted contribution to world peace and that means involvement in Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>I commend all the forces involved in more than 50 years of participation in peacekeeping activities throughout the world. They have proven that this small country has a positive role to play in peacekeeping operations. During our 40 years of <Col N="836" /> service throughout the world, we have excelled in our methods of peacekeeping. We have proven the point in almost every area of conflict that, as a small country, we are positive in our approach and are clearly seen as peacemakers. It would be a shame, therefore, if we failed to recognise what is happening in the world around us and did not step up our activity in this regard. We should provide the Army with the skills necessary to equip its members to play a fuller role in a world that is too often faced with a crisis of one kind or another. It is, therefore, imperative that we make this move forward, make our contribution to the world and equip ourselves to do so.</P>
    <P>If one was to study all the arguments involved, one could probably summarise them by saying that Partnership for Peace is the lesser evil for the greater good. I commend the Government in its approach to this issue and I have no difficulty in supporting the Partnership for Peace proposal.</P>

      <P>I wonder when a large sector of Irish people will learn a very simple lesson, namely, that one cannot trust anything Fianna Fáil says in Opposition. When in Opposition, Fianna Fáil will say anything, do anything, adopt any cause and promise any remedy in order to get back into Government. The Fianna Fáil Party is particularly deceptive at election time. If Fianna Fáil identifies any lobby or group, no matter how small, it will read its material and tell it exactly what it wants to hear.</P>

      <P>In the run-up to the last election, the then Government, for the first time in the history of the State, engaged the public in a debate about Ireland's foreign policy. A different approach was being taken to the preparation and formulation of Irish foreign policy. A series of public seminars was organised by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, the White Paper on foreign policy was published and an attempt was made, for the first time, to take the making of Irish foreign policy out of the exclusive preserve of the mandarins in Iveagh House and engage the public in its formation. Inevitably, in the course of that debate, issues relating to neutrality were discussed. What did neutrality mean in the modern context, what role would Ireland play in collective security in the modern world and what implications had the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy for Ireland?</P>
      <P>Prior to the last general election, Fianna Fáil saw enough in this public debate to make it scream &ldquo;sell-out&rdquo; on the question of neutrality. It identified a constituency of voters to which issues such as neutrality, Irish foreign policy, security issues and the Partnership for Peace, in particular, were of concern. Fianna Fáil's approach to that constituency was to identify what it wanted to hear and repeat it verbatim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no mistake about the message from <Col N="837" /> Fianna Fáil in the run-up to the last election. The message was crystal clear &ndash; Fianna Fáil was opposed to Partnership for Peace and intended to hold a referendum on it. The message that it was opposed to Partnership for Peace was crystal clear, particularly from the speech given by the current Taoiseach in this House when he was Leader of the Opposition. That speech has been referred to on a number of occasions by other speakers. The commitment that a referendum would be held on Partnership for Peace was made quite explicit in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and in statements leading up to the election. There was absolutely no doubt but that Fianna Fáil intended, in the run-up to the last election, to communicate to the public a general opposition to Partnership for Peace and a commitment to hold a referendum on it.</P>
    <P>Now, two and a half years later, Fianna Fáil is introducing a motion to join Partnership for Peace and speaker after speaker on the Government side of the House is saying that circumstances have changed. Only one circumstance has changed in that two and a half year period, namely, Fianna Fáil has moved from the Opposition side of the House, where it thought it was convenient to oppose PfP, to the Government side where it now proposes that we join it.</P>
    <P>The most insulting aspect of this debate, as far as the public is concerned, is the invitation from the Taoiseach and others to examine the small print of the commitment made prior to the general election. We are now being invited to consider the proposition that Fianna Fáil's position was not that it would hold a referendum on PfP &ndash; that was not in the small print &ndash; but that it would hold a referendum only if there were implications for neutrality. That is worse than a good, old-fashioned Fianna Fáil U-turn because it tells me that this is not a U-turn at all and that Fianna Fáil had no intention of holding a referendum on the PfP. It crafted its election manifesto so carefully that it would subsequently be able to justify not holding a referendum by reference to the small print in the text of the document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That was nothing more than downright deception by Fianna Fáil of the people prior to the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making the case that we should have a referendum simply because it was in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. God knows we have learned the hard way that things in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto have to be taken with a Government health warning. There has been, particularly in the context of our membership of the European Union, a long-standing political commitment on the part of the general political leadership in this country to consult the people by way of referendum in relation to the military, defence and security implications, certainly of our membership of the European Union and anything impacting on neutrality. I recall, for <Col N="838" /> example, in particular that in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum, explicit political commitments were given that there would be a referendum if the political commitments into which we were entering at that stage in relation to the common, foreign and security policy was at any time going to deepen and become a military or defence commitment.</P>
    <P>The idea being peddled by Fianna Fáil that this meant we would only have a referendum on neutrality is nonsense because, as we know, there is no requirement to have a referendum on neutrality. Neutrality is not referred to in the Constitution, so it does not arise. There has been a commitment that there would be a referendum in relation to the core issue of the direction of Ireland's defence and security commitment where that went beyond a purely political commitment as it was in the Maastricht referendum.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace represents that critical core departure. The decision on Partnership for Peace is not as it is being represented &ndash; simply a vote on the proposition which has been put forward. It is basically about the direction this country is taking on matters of defence and security where they have military implications for us. It is fundamentally different from the commitments and arrangements we already have through the United Nations and the European Union. Our membership of the United Nations is accepted by the people, and has been for a long time. The people take great pride, as I do, in the commitment and sacrifice of the members of the Defence Forces to UN peacekeeping operations in different parts of the world through the years, and there is widespread support for that. Notwithstanding that widespread support, however, there has always been a requirement that proposals on individual missions would have to come before this House for decision and approval because it was always recognised that there was a democratic requirement to give involvement by the Defence Forces a democratic authority and mandate through a vote in this House.</P>
    <P>Similarly, our commitment and participation in the common, foreign and security policy of the European Union has already been voted on and approved by the people through the vote in the Maastricht Treaty referendum. That, as we know, commits Ireland to participation in the common foreign and security policy and it defines the Western European Union, for example, as being an integral part of the European Union. In both cases &ndash; this is where they differ from the PfP proposition &ndash; there are two distinct differences. The first is that in the case of the United Nations there has been general universal acceptance of our participation in the UN process. In the case of the common foreign and security policy arrangements of the European Union, that has been approved by way of referendum through the Maastricht Treaty. Second, in both cases security arrangements are in the context of a political arrangement, our political institutions which, in turn, have democratic legitimacy. In the case of <Col N="839" /> the United Nations, it is the global political institution which is universally acceptable and in the case of the European Union, although we do not have any military or specific defence commitment in relation to our membership of it as of yet, our involvement in the common foreign and security policy is in the context of European Union political institutions which, in turn, have democratic accountability. In other words, there is a political and institutional context for our participation in both the United Nations and EU arrangements.</P>
    <P>What is the political context or what are the institutional arrangements which surround our participation in Partnership for Peace? I see no democratic intergovernmental political institution which corresponds to the states signing up to the Partnership for Peace. The Partnership for Peace arrangement was established by NATO and since the end of the Cold War NATO has been desperate to carve out a new role and justification for itself. Indeed, arguably so desperate was it that it undertook a very poorly thought out military engagement in the Gulf region in recent times which itself was the subject of considerable criticisms from people such as Henry Kissinger, for example, who criticised it on the grounds that it was not well thought out and who questioned the role of NATO in the modern world.</P>

      <P>He is hardly an entirely disinterested commentator on the issue. He is as good a commentator and as good an authority to speak on it as some of the people who have been speaking on it, certainly in the course of the debate in this House.</P>
      <P>NATO has been developing a defence arrangement which is an alternative to the United Nations and it is one at which we should look fairly critically. My political outlook is very much an internationalist one. We live in a global society. We need to have new, strengthened global political institutions and a reform of the United Nations to respond to that. In that context, clearly there is a role for a global security arrangement and for regional security arrangements. Clearly, there will be requirements for military intervention, the defence of human rights and so on at different points in time. It is essential that the exercise of that role, the bodies which exercise it and the institutions which govern them belong to a democratic institutional international framework and are not simply established on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. It is not good enough to join Partnership for Peace simply because everybody else is doing it. What would Frank Aiken say today to those members of Fianna Fáil who are advocating that our membership of Partnership for Peace should be undertaken simply because everybody else is doing it?</P>

      <P>This is a timely opportunity to <Col N="840" /> debate this issue and to clarify some misconceptions. Deputy Gilmore alluded to the fact that the small print was important in our manifesto prior to the last election. I thank him for reading it in-depth and studying it. It is a pity he did not explain it prior to this debate so that some of his people would have realised where we stood on this issue. I would like to read the Irish Presentation Document for the Partnership for Peace programme:</P>
      <P>Ireland wishes to respond positively to the invitation extended in 1994 to States of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy deliberately omit &ldquo;extended by NATO&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to participate in the Partnership for Peace. Ireland also wishes to participate in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The broad participation in Partnership for Peace since 1994 underlines the fact that Partnership for Peace, including the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, has become an important framework for co-operation and confidence building in its own right.</P>
      <P>In accepting the invitation to participate in Partnership for Peace, Ireland reinstates its commitment to a just and peaceful international society based on the rule of law; democracy; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Partnership for Peace and the co-operative values which underlie the Partnership are compatible with these commitments and objectives.</P>
      <P>Ireland pursues a policy of military neutrality and does not intend to become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Ireland's decision to participate in Partnership for Peace is in full accordance with Ireland's policy of military neutrality, which has always been pursued in tandem with full and active support for collective security, based on international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland agrees with the basic concept of PfP: that stability and security in the Euro-Atlantic area can be achieved only through co-operation and common action. Ireland shares the values fundamental to PfP, set out in the PfP framework document, including protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights and safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace through democracy. In joining PfP, Ireland, in common with the other PfP nations, reaffirms its commitment to fulfil in good faith the obligations of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Equally, Ireland reaffirms its commitment to the Helsinki Final Act and all subsequent documents <Col N="841" /> of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.</P>
    <P>Participation in PfP entails reaffirmation of the commitment of participating States to the fulfilment of the commitments and obligations they have undertaken in the field of disarmament and arms control. Ireland reaffirms its commitments and obligations in this area.</P>
    <P>Ireland plays an active role in UN peacekeeping [is acknowledged throughout the world for its independence and fairness] and supports the continuing elaboration of effective international strategies and action for conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management. In this connection Ireland attaches importance to effective and mutually reinforcing co-operation between those institutions with a role to play in the search for peace and stability in Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes the role that co-operation for peacekeeping has assumed in Partnership for Peace and looks forward to contributing to partnership activities in this area. The calls on the international community to be able to respond to the humanitarian needs of populations in crisis have become increasingly apparent in recent years.</P>
    <P>In 1997 the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council came into being as the overarching framework for political and security-related consultations for the enhanced co-operation under PfP. Ireland has welcomed the development of the EAPC as a flexible forum, involving a wide range of European and North American countries, for consultations and co-operation on political and security-related matters of common concern, including regional issues, arms control, peacekeeping, civil emergency planning, scientific and environmental issues.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes the intention of the EAPC to examine ways in which it might support global humanitarian action against mines. Ireland also welcomes the initiative to examine how the EAPC might contribute to controlling the transfer of small arms, recognising the high number of innocent civilian casualties caused by the use of mines and small arms.</P>
    <P>That is an outline of the Irish Presentation Document for the Partnership for Peace programme. Reading it should allay the fears of those who are concerned that our neutrality may be infringed. Our commitment within Partnership for Peace to try to bring about nuclear disarmament and to control the sale of small arms and landmines is very positive and in keeping with our policy, as a small nation, to develop a common foreign policy on such issues.</P>
    <P>When Partnership for Peace was launched by President Clinton in 1994, it was seen primarily as a means of outreach and reassurance to new democracies in eastern Europe, many of which wished to join NATO. Hence the early percep<Col N="842" /> tions that PfP was primarily intended as a waiting room for NATO membership. PfP has since developed into an important framework in its own right. Many neutral European states have joined and there are now many states involved which do not wish to join NATO. The fact that a majority of neutral states are interested in joining Partnership for Peace shows that the initial aim of Partnership for Peace has changed dramatically. There are now 43 states involved in Partnership for Peace, 24 of which are not members of NATO. Most are European states which have expressed their positive approach to neutrality in their own Parliaments and are not interested in joining PfP. That should reassure those who feel that Partnership for Peace is a stepping stone to NATO. We are not going down that road. Partnership for Peace is a framework for co-operation and is not the same thing as NATO. PfP does not oblige Ireland to support NATO policies or actions. It does not involve any mutual defence guarantee or commitment and does not affect Ireland's policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>There have been important developments in PfP since 1996 that confirm the validity of the conclusions of the 1996 White Paper to which Deputy Gilmore referred. Regarding Deputy Gilmore's contribution, the fact that Deputy Spring travelled the country and brought in a broad spectrum of people to consult on Irish foreign policy was a positive step. However, in wanting to join Partnership for Peace he also had grave difficulties in his own party and with colleagues on the left who are now members of the Labour Party. While it was a useful exercise, it was also a stalling exercise.</P>
    <P>In May 1997 the EAPC provided the overarching framework for political and security-related consultations under Partnership for Peace and the EAPC has become an important forum for discussions, bringing together the PfP states on a wide range of matters, including developments in peacekeeping, humanitarian issues, regional matters, arms control, civil defence and disaster relief, which is an important issue that will be expanded upon in future.</P>
    <P>Ireland is on the periphery of Europe and will have to play a huge role in the protection of Europe in the future. I hope Partnership for Peace's parameters will be pushed out to ensure that it encompasses intelligence gathering on drug dealing and arms importation, having often said that Ireland has been let down by the EU in its war against drug trafficking. I am sure that in the European context, Ireland would try to defend European borders against drug importation.</P>
    <P>The origins of PfP lie in the situation in Europe following the end of the Cold War some ten years ago. New patterns of security co-operation involving former adversaries and neutral European states have emerged and continue to evolve. The emerging European security architecture emphasises co-operation, not confrontation, and reflects values which have always been at the <Col N="843" /> heart of Irish foreign policy. These include the importance of collective security, based on principles of international law, the necessity for a comprehensive concept of security, going beyond purely military aspects, which responds to the emerging risks and challenges of our common security, effective international action for conflict prevention, peacekeeping and international crisis management. Effective co-operation, not only between states but between all the organisations with a role to play in the search for peace and stability in Europe, is important.</P>
    <P>Traditional concepts of European security and defence have been overtaken by general acceptance that strategies of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management are key to ensuring stability and security in Europe. This evolution goes in the direction of Ireland's approach, which has always emphasised conflict prevention and peacekeeping. A clear example of this new approach to European security issues can be seen in the Amsterdam Treaty which accords priority to the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management activities. The EU was lacking when it came to dealing with recent conflicts which took place outside its borders, even humanitarian issues. The Union was unable to get basic humanitarian supplies to areas in which conflicts were taking place and in which massive refugee problems were developing. Unfortunately we stood idly by and were unable to address the problems. As we move into PfP I hope there will be closer co-operation between member states, neutral and otherwise, and that we will be able to ensure that, wherever there is a conflict, Ireland will be able to play a positive role in peacekeeping, humanitarian aid and crisis management under UN resolutions.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately some issues have not been addressed because of the different organisations, the ineffectiveness, in some cases, of the UN, and the politics within the Security Council. The people of East Timor were blatantly let down by the UN which guaranteed them a vote on independence. NGOs warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if military personnel were not sent in. Unfortunately, the UN acted belatedly and we saw the result. I extend my best wishes to the Irish troops travelling to East Timor and wish them safe passage and a safe return. East Timor is an example of where the UN failed to act decisively. I hope that the broadening of PfP will mean that we will be able to play a more proactive role internationally to ensure that we safeguard human rights and democracy. If they are threatened I hope that PfP will give us the ability to address the situation through providing humanitarian relief, logistics or troops to ensure that we can enforce peace through a UN Security Council mandate. This is very important.</P>
    <P>For too long countries have sat back and condemned those who took pre-emptive action. Sometimes this action was unnecessary but, for <Col N="844" /> example, the US addressed the situation in Kosovo. No one liked the fact that there was high altitude bombing, some of which was indiscriminate and had unfortunate consequences. However, in the overall context of the US involvement, at least it tried to address the problems. Kosovan refugees arriving in Ireland were very appreciative of that fact. Unfortunately the EU was unable to address many of the humanitarian problems close to its borders. I commend the Government for its decision and I am confident of defending that decision on any platform as it is in accordance with my view that Ireland has to take its place among the nations of the world and play a proactive role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate. It is evident from the debate so far that there are divided opinions within the House and within all parties on this issue. This debate takes place within the context of where Ireland sees its role in terms of foreign policy. Is that role always to be one of hand-wringing and proclaiming from the high moral ground that someone should do something about a crisis in Kosovo, East Timor, Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia, or that we should tackle genocide or internal conflicts which have the capacity to destabilise regions? This debate should be about defining where Ireland sees its role in the context of foreign policy and playing a positive role in contributing towards a more peaceful and stable political environment.</P>
      <P>The security architecture of the world has changed significantly over the past ten to 15 years. We have seen the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall. As a child I can recall the great heads of state meetings between the presidents of the US and the Soviet Union. There was always tension as to whether there would be agreement or disagreement at these meetings and what the consequences would be for the world. That system has changed but there was an element of security in the balance which existed between East and West. PfP has emerged because of the new-found political realities, primarily in the former Soviet Union. It is a policy response to the uncertainty and the dismantling of the Soviet Union and the need to construct a new security architecture to take account of the world in which we now live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers have reflected almost wistfully about the role the UN should, could or would play if given the chance. That is an academic debate as, unfortunately, notwithstanding the good intentions of most members, the reality is that the UN has become virtually powerless and incapable of taking the swift political decisions often necessary in terms of intervention in conflicts and preventing local conflicts escalating to threaten entire regions. The UN is incapable of intervening in situations where there is widespread discrimination against populations leading to genocide, such as that in East Timor where it took an extraordinary length of time to respond. <Col N="845" /> Ultimately the UN did respond, but there are numerous other examples where it failed to respond in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>The ideal solution would be if the family of nations, under the banner of the UN, was able to respond effectively to crises. There would be no need for PfP, NATO or other such political institutions in such circumstances. However, the sad reality is that it has not been possible. Most regional conflicts are being resolved by regional forces, some with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the UN and others with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the local superpower. The response to the situation in Rwanda was headed by an African led force, the UN played a role in the former Yugoslavia, NATO played a role in Kosovo and NATO and the UN are playing a role in East Timor. Obviously UN involvement would be the ideal solution, but that is not proving practical and that is why we need to look at new institutions which will play a practical and efficient role in conflict resolution.</P>
    <P>Much of this debate has focused on the promises made by Fianna Fáil in Opposition concerning a referendum. As politicians, we would do well to take stock of the dismal standing of politics and politicians among the public. I have been campaigning in the Dublin by-election and the response on the doorstep is frighteningly apathetic and hostile. I canvassed in urban elections before but I have never witnessed such a level of anger, frustration, contempt and disillusionment with the political establishment. By and large this is due to the actions and inactions of politicians. I do not want to make a party political point of it, but I think we will be judged on our words and deeds, and if our deeds do not match our words, we invite criticism. That is what is happening in the context of this debate and it is regrettable.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for a referendum. It has been Fine Gael policy for a long time that we should join Partnership for Peace and we have never seen a conflict in that context between that proposal and the commitments which we have given along with other parties that should we wish to join a military alliance we would consult the people. Hiding behind a referendum is a way of abdicating our political responsibility. We should recall that on previous occasions when we gave in to pressure for referenda, the reality came back to haunt us. I speak, in particular, about pro-life amendments in the 1980s, where this House capitulated to pressures, both internal and external, the consequences of which we are still trying to grapple with and resolve. The type of comments which were made by the Taoiseach when he spoke about the French in Killala, the Spanish in Kinsale and whatever else &ndash; I cannot recall exactly the words he used &ndash; reminded me of the response of Fianna Fáil on previous occasions when we signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement and there was talk of the RUC coming down to Tralee. As politicians, we must be very careful about the language we use, particularly when we are talking about foreign policy because words have meanings and they come back to haunt us. <Col N="846" /> This treats with contempt the electorate who are beginning to treat us with contempt in return and that is a very dangerous development for democracy. I regret very much that the main party in Government saw fit to play politics with what I believe was an important issue.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the fact that there has been no debate about our proposed membership of Partnership for Peace. I cannot accept that because four years ago we published a White Paper on Foreign Policy and there has been intermittent debate on the merits and demerits of Partnership for Peace since then. Last January Fine Gael tabled a Private Members' motion in this House where the first straws in the wind of a change in Government policy emerged. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member, has discussed this matter in some considerable detail. Those who repeatedly make the point that there has been no debate, there must be a debate and we cannot take this momentous step in foreign policy without having a debate appear to have little else to say other than that we need a debate. They make no actual meaningful contribution other than scaremongering and raising issues, which have little foundation in reality, about us allegedly selling our military neutrality down the drain if we were to join Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, in the context of our closer co-operation with other nations of the world and, in particular, within the European Union, that the people have voted repeatedly for closer co-operation, be it in the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty or the Amsterdam Treaty referenda. While I do not support the need for a referendum on Partnership for Peace, I do not see that that step is in any way out of kilter with the increasing willingness of the Irish people to participate more closely with other nations on these matters.</P>
    <P>The question then raised is what is Partnership for Peace. Is it closer alignment with nations? Is it the slippery slope to full membership of NATO? The reality is that Partnership for Peace is what we make it. It is what we want it to be. It can be closer co-operation. It can be co-operation at arm's length. In reality, we can cherry-pick the issues in which we want to get involved, be it peacekeeping, peace-enforcement etc. The list in the Presentation Document outlines them in detail: co-operation on peacekeeping, humanitarian operations, search and rescue, co-operation in the protection of the environment and co-operation in marine matters. It could involve much more, it could involve much less. The reality is that we hold the policy cards in our own hands. We can decide the level of participation we want.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the fact that key NATO people have stated that it is seen as a backdoor to full membership of NATO. They can say what they like. The reality is it will be what the Dáil decides and, according to the commitments given by all the political parties, if Ireland <Col N="847" /> is to join a military alliance such as NATO, the Dáil will first consult the people in detail.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that other nations, which, like Ireland, would be considered neutral militarily, have seen no difficulty with participating in Partnership for Peace. This was evident from the consultations which the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs conducted on this matter. For example, Switzerland, which has said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to membership of the United Nations and membership of the European Union, has been able to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to Partnership for Peace. It said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to joining the aforementioned organisations because of the obligations membership would impose on the state in terms of closer co-operation, but it sees no difficulty with membership of Partnership for Peace. That is a significant nail in the coffin of the argument that joining Partnership for Peace is in some way a sell-out of our military neutrality. Likewise, Sweden, Austria and Finland have equally argued that it does not conflict with their policy position of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear Deputy Gormley attack Fine Gael because we were not in favour of a referendum. We do not do U-turns as the Government has done. Fine Gael's long-time stated policy outlined clearly where we stood prior to the last election, in Private Members' motions, at Question Time and on numerous other occasions. I suppose imitation is a form of flattery, which we welcome in that both Government parties are now taking the same line as Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I found it comical that the Green Party attacked Partnership for Peace, saying that it was anything but that. If one was to question the labels which people hang on themselves, one could have good fun analysing that for which the Green Party stands. I do not propose to go down that route now, but I thought it was a snide and cheap comment by Deputy Gormley on the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome our proposed membership of Partnership for Peace. I look forward to closer integration between the member states of Partnership for Peace and NATO in areas where I believe we can make a meaningful contribution to the improvement of international relations and to the lives of many people who currently live in conflict zones, where some form of intervention is what they desperately cry out for on many occasions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely debate, which has been by and large constructive. Fifty years ago Ireland was one of the 11 states which established the Council of Europe. In the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the European Union, Ireland has been to the forefront in seeking and advocating European and international partnerships to alleviate some of the distressing problems in the international community. This new Partnership for Peace and the new Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council are important developments in co-oper<Col N="848" /> ation and the consolidation of the peace effort. In our participation in the alliance and in the partnership, we are signalling Ireland's continuing efforts to establish peace with justice throughout the international community and to work with our partners in Europe and other countries in finding ways in which the huge problems in the international community can be effectively tackled and dealt with in this new alignment.</P>
      <P>In 1993-94, the NATO countries and, in particular, the United States were, as is well known, fairly actively involved in finding ways to attract the emerging democracies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I visited a number of pickets outside hospitals. I met nurses who were angry, frustrated and extremely vocal. Most of all, I met nurses who did not want to be there, they wanted to be at work and they were very aware of the value of their worth, as advocates and as carers of the sick and the dying. However, these committed people had taken the drastic step, as they see it, of leaving their patients to stand on the picket line because all other means to address their needs had failed and because the future of nursing demands it of them. They described themselves as the plaster in the cracks, the mortar between the bricks, the polyfilla of the health ser<Col N="849" /> vices, and nobody could disagree with that description of the essential role of nurses. Doctors agree with it, which is clear from the statements they made in recent weeks, as do other health professionals, patients and the public at large. When our families, our own flesh and blood, can or will no longer care for us, it is nurses who provide the care we need. A nurse is most likely to be the first person we see when we open our eyes for the very first time when we are born and the last person we see before we close our eyes at the moment of death. All our lives nurses care and look after us when we need it. It is time that we look after them, not just for their sake but for the sake of the profession itself.</P>
    <P>That is what makes this strike potentially so disastrous. It removes the mortar from between the bricks in a way that destabilises the very foundation of our health service. Today has been described by one nurse as the saddest and darkest day in the history of Irish nursing. Another nurse referred to it as &ldquo;Black Tuesday&rdquo;. Withdrawing his or her care from patients goes against everything for which a nurse stands. It goes against the training, the ethos, the vocation of nursing. However, nurses have been driven to take what is, for them, an unprecedented, desperate action. They know that what they are doing has an impact on their patients and they have shown great responsibility in how they have gone about taking industrial action. The fact that they are providing unpaid emergency cover speaks for itself. They also know that if they do not stand up for their profession now, it will not have a future that is worthy of the name.</P>
    <P>What is most significant about this first ever all-out strike by nurses is that it should never have happened. It was not inevitable. It is the direct result of Government failure, not just of the Minister for Health and Children but of a collective Cabinet which made the conscious decision not to act or intervene while there was still time. This strike could and should have been pre-empted long before we reached crisis point. If the Government was capable and caring enough to meet the task, all nurses would be at work today. However, this is a Government beset by financial scandals, a Government that appears unaware of the anger of its people as they hear more and more evidence not just of low standards in high places but of a flagrant disregard for laws that govern the rest of us and a Government which appears unconcerned about the fact that for too long we have had one law for the rich and one for the poor.</P>
    <P>Nurses are tired of the promises that have not been delivered upon. The Government's programme committed it to tackle waiting lists, but instead they have grown longer. There are approximately 34,000 people on these lists at present, a figure that will inevitably increase now. We have a health service that is underfunded, with closed wards and operating theatres and crowded, stressful accident and emergency units. Nurses live with these deficiencies on a daily basis <Col N="850" /> and they bear the brunt of public dissatisfaction with the health system. They deal with the increasing expectations of a growing population that is generally more affluent, educated and litigious and whose frustration grows as their health needs are not met.</P>
    <P>Shortcomings in the health services are a daily reality for nurses. The matron of the National Maternity Hospital reminded us in <i>The Irish Times</i> during the week that it was nursing midwives who offered to forgo part of their salaries in the midst of the severity of the mid-1980s health cuts in order to limit staff reductions and thus maintain a high standard of care despite the cutbacks. It is nurses who have fought to hold our health service together. In return, it is nurses who have the longest working week, the shortest annual leave and the lowest pay of all health professionals. Is this truly how we wish to reward years of service and dedication?</P>
    <P>The Government keeps reminding us of the dangers inherent in pay relativities and follow-on claims from other groups in the public sector if pay demands by the nurses are met. It is worth reminding this House that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has no difficulty defending increases of up to 40 per cent for politicians in order to attract and retain high quality individuals to the profession. He has noted the significantly greater amounts the same individuals could earn in the private sector. Our politicians, he said, deserve to be properly paid and to be treated fairly in accordance with the work they do, their commitment to the public good and their profession. It is time, he feels, to recognise that the successful operation of our system of government rests with our politicians and to reward them in accordance with the responsibility they carried on our behalf.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the same logic has failed to carry through to the Government's thinking in relation to nurses. Instead the Minister for Finance has called them claim-jumpers. Since we do not treat our health system with the recognition, reward and funding it deserves, we are already finding it increasingly difficult to attract and retain the necessary medical and nursing personnel. Depending on which estimate one takes, it appears that at least 1,000 nurses are needed at present, yet the haemorrhage of nurses out of the system will be accelerated even further unless a new direction is taken in terms of the pay, conditions and status of nurses. One thing is clear, there is no shortage of money to pay nurses well. Nobody, even the Minister, has argued that their case is undeserving or that the course of action nurses have taken is illegal or even unusual in industrial relations terms.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago the Government announced an Exchequer surplus of £1.7 billion. That is almost double the amount forecast in last year's budget. On 22 September nurses voted overwhelmingly to reject the Labour Court recommendation. Under industrial legislation they have a perfect right to do so because a recommendation is not <Col N="851" /> mandatory. The Minister, in the statements he issued in recent weeks, constantly used the term &ldquo;arbitration&rdquo;, but he was being disingenuous.</P>
    <P>There are many examples where Labour Court recommendations were rejected by one side or the other. Normal practice has been that such rejection would lead to further negotiations. What was different in this instance is that the Minister refused to negotiate, he refused even to talk to the nurses. Instead the Government embarked on a course which can only be described as macho brinkmanship. The Minister for Finance accused nurses of being claim-jumpers and the Taoiseach supported him. The Minister for Health and Children tried to frighten nurses with the argument that they would be responsible for cutbacks in the health service. Even the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, who should know better, in this House attacked nurses and my defence of them. Of course, Deputy McDaid, as a doctor, does know better. On 19 Jan 1997 he wrote in the <i>Irish Independent</i>: &ldquo;Why have we reached the point where for the first time ever we are faced with the prospect of nurses on a hospital picket line?&rdquo;  He gave the following answer:</P>
    <P>The public has always assumed that because nurses work in an area where health, life and death are so much to the fore they would never even contemplate a strike. Consequently such agencies as the Department of Finance have taken them for granted and have kept them firmly locked in a scheme where it is ordained that the various public service workers must keep their places in the pecking order.</P>
    <P>We must accept that nurses should be treated as a very special case by the public service and by the Department of Finance in particular.</P>
    <P>So said Deputy McDaid two short years ago yet last week in this House he lectured the nurses in a way they found offensive and which was clearly ineffective. When it was clear that the nurses were going to go ahead with the strike the Minister for Health and Children sent a letter to their representatives. This, I understand, was the first communication he had had with them since the Labour Court recommendation was published. On Sunday last when he went on radio we all listened very carefully to what he had to say. He sought an assurance from the nursing unions which was given immediately and which the unions say was nothing new for them to say. Yesterday, on the eve of the strike, the Minister sat down for the first time with the Nursing Alliance. It took until the eleventh hour for him to do so when there was clearly no hope of averting the strike.</P>
    <P>It is significant that any reference to the Labour Court recommendation has suddenly disappeared from the Minister's lexicon. What is his view now? Is it that a 95 per cent rejection by the workforce means that the Labour Court recom<Col N="852" /> mendation cannot be enforced? If that is the case why, in God's name, did he not come to that conclusion weeks ago when the nurses had made their position crystal clear? Did the Minister believe that by ignoring that reality it would, somehow, change?</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the public asks the key questions. Why did the Minister take so long and why is he still taking so long? Talks could have begun weeks ago. They could have gone on all night in order to reach a resolution. Instead the Minister ended at 5.50 p.m., teatime, a civilised hour for anyone who wants to catch the six o'clock news but this hardly sends out the signal that the Minister is conscious of the need for urgency, or even that these talks are for real. The unions have met with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as requested, and the ICTU has sought an urgent meeting with the employers. The fact that this meeting is being held indicates that at last the Government understands that this is a matter of urgency. The intervention of the ICTU is very welcome and it is incumbent on the Government to respond positively, quickly and imaginatively even at this late hour. If action is being taken now why could it not have been taken weeks ago? It is no wonder that the public is perplexed and worried.</P>
    <P>Today all non-emergency surgery and out-patient clinics in the 46 acute hospital across the country were cancelled. An estimated 7,000 appointments will be cancelled every day this strike goes on. Already patients requiring medical procedures have had them cancelled. This has been happening for a number of days now. There is hidden suffering of which, I am sure, all TDs are aware in their own constituencies and which will only deepen unless there is a swift resolution to the dispute.  I know of one man, for example, who has a form of gangrene, and who requires a toe amputation. This procedure was cancelled although his is an excruciatingly painful condition. This is the kind of case which inevitably results from Government delay and prevarication. I have been told of one paediatric hospital where children are affected because their intravenous drips, normally provided by skilled and experienced nurses, will have to be inserted by junior doctors who do not have the same level of skill as nurses. If the doctor fails to get the drip inserted after two attempts the nurse is called. One can only imagine the distress that this can cause a sick child. How can the Minister, who describes himself as Minister for Health and Children, justify the price of his inaction being paid by hospitalised children? It is clear that the system cannot sustain more days of a strike of this magnitude.</P>
    <P>I read the report in <i>The Irish Times </i>of emergency arrangements in the various hospitals. In St. James Hospital all routine out-patient procedures have been postponed except for those for coagulation and warfarin patients and other special cases. In Beaumont out-patient clinics, blood tests and elective admissions have been <Col N="853" /> cancelled. In Cork University Hospital, of the 260 nurses normally on duty, only 70 will be rostered. In the Mater Hospital, Dublin all non-emergency admissions have been cancelled, out-patient clinics have been deferred although special arrangements will be made for urgent cases such as fractures and warfarin. It goes on and on. This is happening in every acute hospital. Cases which may not be emergencies can very quickly become so and it is clear that the suffering and distress caused to patients is very real indeed.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this strike is deeply disturbing. Already our health service is typified by a two tier system in which those who can afford to pay access treatment faster than those who cannot. Because the Government allowed this strike to take place, that inequality has become even more acute. The private hospitals are still fully operational and the consultants' private consulting rooms are open. For the private patient this strike has a very different outcome than for the public patient. The inequality that is such an ugly feature of our health services has been deepened and exacerbated in an entirely new and unjustifiable way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the intervention of the ICTU which is the first real ray of hope. All of us hope that a new initiative is possible and that it will be successful. It is very likely that nurses will be asked to adopt a new approach and to prove, yet again, their flexibility. But it should not be up to nurses alone to prove their willingness to adapt to change. What is required is a fundamental change of heart from the Government. So far it appears able only to totter from one crisis to the next. At a time of plenty our health services suffer a malaise that demands a new and vigorous political leadership. Tragically, that is the one thing it has not received. The problems of patient care, waiting lists, closed wards and empty operating theatres, staff shortages and staff exhaustion are legion.  I urge the Minister to respond to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions swiftly and effectively to bring about a just settlement and to allow the nurses to go back to work. But the Minister must accept that he is responsible for having made a bad situation worse. His trail of destruction has led us to this point where the inherent difficulties of our health services have been made significantly worse. It is clear that the inherent problems within our healthcare system are still waiting for a Minister who has the capability and the commitment to put things right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate although I had hoped it would not be necessary to debate this issue this evening. I had hoped the Minister would have intervened to ensure that today's events would not take place. The inflexible and often belligerent attitude of the Minister for Health and Children and the Government became clear this morning. Many people, including myself, did not think we would see the day when nurses who have selflessly contributed to the development of <Col N="854" /> the health care services would be forced on to the picket line in their campaign for fair play and a fair wage. However, the stance the Government adopted in the critical days since nurses voted against the Labour Court recommendation left the nursing profession with no option. Until the eleventh hour the Government refused to meet the nurses face to face. Government Ministers lectured nurses on the airwaves. They insulted nurses with their belligerent sound bites. Confrontation and not conciliation was the order of the day. It is this attitude which has resulted in the nurses strike. Nurses are on the picket line because the Government did not have the decency to meet them face to face in the days after the vote.</P>
      <P>I have heard many Government Deputies speak in the House and elsewhere about the success of partnership. Unless I am a dodo, the essence of partnership is communication, not confrontation, and this involves the unilateral implementation of the fundamentals of partnership. It must be brought about by both sides. I could never understand in regard to this dispute that while partnership was lauded, the sound fundamentals of partnership policies over the past 12 years were not utilised to ensure communication through face to face talks where the issues would be thrashed out around the table away from the glare of the national press.</P>
      <P>One makes a stand based on sound fundamentals and if members of the Government parties have a problem with this analysis, I challenge them to visit the nurses on picket lines throughout the country, as I and many of my colleagues did this morning. I was on the picket lines at Mullingar General Hospital, St. Mary's Hospital, Mullingar, which cares for the elderly, and St. Loman's psychiatric hospital. I spoke to nurses who are genuinely at the end of their tether as far as the Government is concerned. They believe that no other professional body in the State would have been subject to the treatment meted out to them over the past fortnight.</P>
      <P>Does anyone on the Government benches understand the anger of nurses who yesterday opened their national newspapers and saw that the Government had spent thousands of pounds advertising its position on this dispute? If the Government showed similar decency in communicating with nurses around a negotiating table rather than through the national press, the health services would not have been plunged into crisis today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not possible for the Labour Court to deal with all the nurses' concerns and I readily acknowledge that a multiplicity of problems attach to the nursing profession but this is not a unique experience in industrial relations. For instance, the management of Tara Mines recently did not accept a Labour Court recommendation. However, during the stand-off, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government did not lecture the parties involved in the dispute about the sanctity of Labour Court recommendations. In tandem with a number of others, he hammered <Col N="855" /> out a deal which effectively changed the recommendations and succeeded in achieving a resolution of the dispute.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court is the last resort when dealing with industrial relations problems but at the end of the day if individuals or groups are entrenched in their views and will not accept its recommendations, an alternative route must be found. If one is not happy with a Circuit Court decision, one appeals it to the High Court and if one is not happy with that, one takes the case to the Supreme Court. Other mechanisms must be available because we are in a new era. What worked in 1946 and 1969 may not work in 1999 and that must be realised. No initiatives were taken to deal with the nurses and there was no negotiation or flexibility. This course of action has hardened the attitude of those on the picket line and it makes resolution of the dispute more difficult.</P>
    <P>However, at long last the Government has realised that the dispute can be resolved only through negotiation. It has taken two weeks for the Minister to realise the blindingly obvious &ndash; so much for a Government whose policies are based on an action programme. I urge the Minister and his colleagues in Government to swiftly bring this strike to an end. Ordinary people who depend on our health services and do not have large wallets or cheque books with which to seek health treatment elsewhere have suffered too much and will continue to suffer as long as nurses remain on the picket line.</P>
    <P>Even without this industrial dispute our health services are struggling to meet the demands placed upon them. There are waiting lists, queues for treatment, staff shortages and mothers who must wait for ENT treatment. These are just some of the problems which the Minister must address to ensure that our health services serve the needs of the community. It is essential that, when more than 90 per cent of a profession dedicated to caring rejects an industrial relations proposal, the Government has the common sense and foresight to sit down and explore avenues to resolve the outstanding issues and embark on a rational, sane course of action without further delay.</P>

      <P>The date 19 October 1999 will be remembered as one of the worst days in the lifetime of the Government. It is, as one senior representative of the nursing unions stated, &ldquo;a black day for our industrial relations&rdquo;. In this era of unprecedented wealth the Government has allowed the nurses dispute to fester for months and let the unthinkable happen. It has forced our 28,000 nurses out on strike through its ineptitude. They have a proud record of serving the people in our hospitals. The Government, to its shame, is the first Administration in the history of the State to allow a national nurses strike to take place, and it is the biggest strike in the history of industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> Before I travelled to Leinster House today I met nurses on the picket line in Killarney and their message was that they wanted the Minister to listen to them. In recent months the Government's attitude to the nurses has been patronising and, at worst, downright insulting. The Minister for Finance has accused the nurses of being &ldquo;hell bent on national chaos&rdquo;. The nurses I met on the picket line today were not hell bent on national chaos but dedicated professionals who deserve respect from their employers.</P>
    <P>It must be understood that the nurses action has arisen as a result of the failure of their employers, county councils, health boards and the Department of Health and Children, to recognise their skills, dedication and professionalism over many years. This failure was primarily due to the fact that employers never imagined that nurses would take industrial action because they were mainly women. This has resulted in the salaries and conditions of nurses falling far behind those of other groups in the health services.</P>
    <P>The previous Government established a Commission on Nursing, which was the first acknowledgement that nurses had received a raw deal over a number of years, especially under the terms of the national agreements since 1987. If that is to be rectified and they are to receive the salaries they deserve, we must have the courage to look beyond the confines of current national programmes and address their concerns. That commission will not be repeated in our lifetime. It produced a document which charts the future of a unique profession.</P>
    <P>I stress that the Minister has hidden behind an erroneous interpretation of the role of the Labour Court and the nature of its recommendations. It must be remembered that the Labour Court merely makes recommendations, which can be rejected or accepted, and in this case more than 90 per cent of nurses in a nationwide ballot democratically voiced their objections to some elements of its recommendations. If the shoe was on the other foot and an employer had rejected recommendations in such an overwhelming manner, the Government would have immediately moved to sit around a table and hammer out a solution. However, such a sensible, reasonable course of action does not extend to nurses. Over the past two weeks nurses have been lectured and their reasonable concerns have been rubbished at the highest levels of Government.</P>
    <P>The democratic voice of thousands of low paid workers, many of whom are women, does not provoke the same response from Government as the rumblings of discontent from the pinstriped suits that fill the boardrooms of Ireland's leading industrial heavyweights. The Government has made a shambles of the dispute and what should have been another important stage in the development of nursing has been transformed into a full-scale crisis, which affects thousands of families. This cannot be allowed to continue. The nursing unions and ICTU want a resolution of this dispute immediately. All it will take is for the <Col N="857" /> Minister to realise the damage that his policy has done to date. He must reverse that policy, swallow some pride and talk seriously to the nurses, who deserve a fair hearing, who want to return to work and who contribute so much to our health care services.</P>

      <P>I fully endorse the Labour Party motion and record my thanks for the opportunity to speak in this debate. Today began what is described as the biggest strike in the history of this country, as nearly 30,000 nurses took to the picket line. This morning I joined the nurses on the picket line at Monaghan General Hospital and St. Davnet's psychiatric hospital. I have seldom met a more determined group of people, nor have I seen such genuine public support for any industrial action. I know from speaking to nurses, not just this morning but over recent weeks, that they are, on the one hand, deeply disturbed that they have been forced into this action but equally resolved to see it through to a just and equitable outcome.</P>
      <P>The nurses strike was a long time in the offing. The Government has no iota of an excuse for its failure to address fully the issues which have led to it. In an economy about which this Government boasts to the world, there is a health service which is losing nurses and closing wards and has growing waiting lists. We have the greatest budget surplus in the history of the State, yet the Government cannot organise the health services to provide the care that is needed.</P>
      <P>What we are seeing in this nurses strike is the final effort to end forever the legacy of structural inequality which has plagued our health service. Because they were predominantly women, nurses were regarded for decades by the men in church and State who controlled the health system as worthy only of menial tasks, while education and lucrative practice was the exclusive preserve of the predominantly male elite of the medical profession. Nurses have worked long and hard to overcome that legacy but still have not been fully recognised as the caring, educated professionals they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Key issues of pay, education, training, promotion and pensions have not been resolved. The anger, sincerity and determination of nurses gives the lie to the claim that this is only about money or that the nurses are leading a stampede of greedy public servants about to trample over the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, like punters at a race meeting. The matron of the National Maternity Hospital wrote movingly in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday of how nurses had to enforce at hospital bed level the savage cuts imposed by successive Governments in the 1980s. They, not Ministers for Health or Taoisigh, were the ones who had to turn patients away and watch them suffer and die because of cutbacks. Only now do we know the full extent of the hypocrisy of the political leaders who imposed those cuts as they lived in extravagant luxury and allowed their wealthy friends to rob the Exchequer of money <Col N="858" /> desperately needed for health care. Is it any wonder there is such anger among nurses and such support for them from ordinary people?</P>
    <P>I welcome the talks now under way in conjunction with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I echo the call of the nurses' representatives for direct and meaningful negotiations. I also call on the Taoiseach to become directly and personally involved and to deploy in the resolution of this dispute the undoubted negotiating skills which he has demonstrated in a number of areas, including, from my own experience, the peace process.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is much abused but there can be no doubt that we are in a national crisis which will deepen every hour this strike continues. It is reprehensible, therefore, that it is proposed by the Government that this Dáil should not sit next week. It would be an absolute disgrace if this assembly was to absent itself during the biggest strike in our history which affects tens of thousands of sick people. I give notice that I will oppose this proposal on the Order of Business tomorrow and I invite other Deputies to join me.</P>
    <P>I extend my solidarity and that of my colleagues in Sinn Féin to the nurses and hope that their action is successful in achieving justice, their basic claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West): </i>I support the motion and thank the spokesperson and Whip of the Labour Party for the time arrangements. It is despicable that tens of thousands of nurses find themselves on picket lines up and down the county. The Government is busy wishing to lose the real issues of this dispute in a fog of talk about relativities, partnerships and catch-ups when it is not insulting the nurses outright, as the Minister for Finance did with his despicable reference to nurses as claim jumpers. Someone should tell the Minister for Finance that the wild west is long gone and that it only existed in the imaginations of comic book writers and cheap novelists. The Minister for Finance should be told that the situation regarding nurses requires far more sensitivity than he might dish out to his friends in a bar in Cheltenham.</P>
      <P>The origins of this crisis go back to the criminal neglect by successive Governments of the health services and those most crucial to it, the nurses. They go back particularly to the savage cuts inflicted in the health services in the late 1980s when student nurses were unceremoniously deprived of an income and a place in a nurses' home. Consequently they have been thrown onto the mercy of landlords who, in many cases, are outright rack-renters, although I have not heard any Government Minister refer to them in the same insulting terms that they scandalously used to refer to the nurses. Hundreds of nurses were lost to the system as a result of such measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that the origin of the crisis goes back to the 1980s. That was the decade when &ldquo;Ansbacher man&rdquo; cast a long shadow over the affairs of this State. The Ansbacher men, the captains of industry, bankers, developers and specu<Col N="859" /> lators, the golden circle of business and politics, the people calling for and implementing savage cuts in public spending, including in the health services, while systematically defrauding the tax system of not tens of millions nor hundreds of millions but billions of pounds, taking into account the offshore scams and the money which was the subject of the tax amnesties in 1988 and 1993. That money could have provided a lifeline for the health services, which would have prevented the cutbacks, suffering and deterioration and which would have allowed the status and role of nurses to be properly recognised and remunerated.</P>
    <P>The Government, which has a direct link to the events of the 1980s, has no moral authority whatsoever in refusing nurses the justifiable claims they have put forward. The Government should be clear that the public is fully behind the nurses' campaign. The Minister should not be fooled by one or two radio programmers who selectively cull from the most negative comments from a tiny minority of the public. Instead he should listen to what the people are saying to the nurses on the picket lines. They appreciate what they have done, recognise the crucial role they play and understand that proper remuneration of nurses and recognition of their position will deliver a health service far superior to what we have at present.</P>
    <P>They also recognise what will happen if the opposite is the case. If the nurses are defeated in this campaign it would have a demoralising effect on them and therefore on the health service. It is in the interests of working people and trade unionists everywhere that nurses are granted their just claims. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions should, by all means, facilitate discussions, but the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should be out in front, leading public support for the nurses, giving voice to it to such an extent that the Government will listen and pay up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the efforts being made by the Minister for Health and Children to bring about a resolution of the nurses' strike by a process through which nursing issues can be addressed within the parameters of social partnership.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very complex and difficult dispute. In saying this, I am not only giving my own view of this dispute, but I am also giving the view of the trade union personnel who are also dealing with it from their side. If it were not a complex issue, we would have found a resolution to the difficulties long before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I want to make abundantly clear is that there has been no change in the position of the Government. Our position has been con<Col N="860" /> sistent throughout. It has never been a case of calling on the Nursing Alliance to simply take or leave the Labour Court findings. The Government want the Labour Court findings accepted and to move on to the other issues in the context of the Commission on Nursing report and social partnership.</P>
    <P>On 23 September, the Taoiseach outlined a credible alternative to confrontation and a way forward that will in my view provide a better outcome for us all, including for nurses.</P>
    <P>I omitted to say I wish to share my time with Deputy Roche.</P>
    <P>That alternative is a renewal of our commitment at national level to social partnership and a series of practical steps to a new partnership agreement. That national position must be combined with an approach to public service pay which is imaginative in ensuring that the income of public servants should more closely reflect their performance and not be based on so-called traditional relativities. This is the context in which the aims and aspirations of public servants, including nurses, can best be met. It would also be the best context within which to set the progressive implementation of the report of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    <P>It was not until last Saturday that I heard, for the first time, an explicit acknowledgement from the Nursing Alliance that it recognised that the Government obviously has difficulties in dealing with this matter in the way that the alliance had been asking it to do up to then. In the course of being interviewed last Sunday on the RTE &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme, I made the following statement:</P>
    <P>I am saying very clearly, and it has always been the Government's position, that if the Nursing Alliance unions recommit themselves to social partnership, acknowledge that we cannot pursue issues in isolation from the wider public sector pay implications, acknowledge that we cannot tear up existing agreements, if that is the position of the Nursing Alliance, then clearly there is a whole range of possibilities open to them to pursue their agenda.</P>
    <P>I have been at pains all along to let everybody know that the problem in dealing with this issue is that existing social partnership agreements must be honoured, and that the primacy of the Labour Court as a means of settling disputes must be upheld. At 3 o'clock last Sunday, the Nursing Alliance issued the following statement:</P>
    <P>The Nursing Alliance wishes to reiterate that it is cognisant of the Government's difficulties in further addressing the outstanding pay issues for nursing grades against the backdrop of existing social agreements.</P>
    <P>The alliance also realises that any discussions will have to consider those difficulties while also providing a forum and process which will address, in a meaningful way, the outstanding <Col N="861" /> pay related issues from the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    <P>In the above context we state once again we are available for talks.</P>
    <P>Later that evening I issued a statement noting this recognition by the Nursing Alliance, and indicating that if the alliance was genuine in its desire to identify a process by which these issues might be addressed within the parameters of pay partnership, then I would be available to meet the alliance the following day, which was yesterday.</P>
    <P>I met the representatives of the Nursing Alliance at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon in the Department of Health and Children in Hawkins House. The most important achievement coming from yesterday's meeting was the mutual recognition of the problems that exist on both sides. It was a good working meeting and I certainly found it helpful and constructive and it provided for a useful exchange of ideas. Both parties agreed to go back to the social partners and talk to their own sides in the partnership and seek help in trying to find a process that will allow for the resolution of this dispute on such a broad basis.</P>
    <P>Having met them yesterday, I feel that the Nursing Alliance is also trying to find a way forward in this matter and they have told me that in finding the way forward the Nursing Alliance is anxious not to undermine the Labour Court findings. The Nursing Alliance is cognisant of the importance of ensuring that existing and current partnership arrangements are not jeopardised and this also concerns the possible knock-on effects, and it has no wish to create additional problems for the Government.</P>
    <P>As a first stage, it is important that the alliance and the management side accept that both sets of problems must be of equal status. I have been at pains to find a way forward that is not prescriptive of the outcome at an early stage. I am trying to put in place a process that will lead to a successful outcome but will not of itself have any harmful pay effects or knock-ons.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to explore the possibilities of doing business in this way and ensuring that the social partners, Government, employers and Congress, would be fully involved. I do not want the social partnership that we have built up to fall down around us during any forthcoming negotiations. Having met the Nursing Alliance yesterday, I am satisfied that it does not want that either.</P>
    <P>Because of the number of people, or groups, lining up behind the current nurses' claim, it is important to ensure that arguments which may seem specific to nursing now are not later used by any of these groups to advance their particular case within the next number of weeks or months. I do not see this route as a lengthy process but it should be comprehensive so that both sides do not simply keep arguing over old scores.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious to ensure that any new process or any new concepts which might be involved in progressing the situation do not interfere, or be <Col N="862" /> seen to interfere, with the primacy of the Labour Court. I have always maintained and I still maintain, that the Labour Court should be the court of final appeal. While I am anxious to devise a new way of resolving the current problems, I do not see this process operating as if the Labour Court did not exist.</P>
    <P>I also believe there must be trust in the social partnership model to ensure that both sides in this dispute would see social partnership as having the integrity necessary to facilitate a solution and to ensure that binding agreements are honoured. It should be our common agenda and it is certainly mine to ensure we get this new process agreed by the social partners and for my part I have indicated to Government that any such initiative should, as it were, have the imprimatur of the social partners. I believe we should have common ground where the representatives of the employers and of the unions would work together quickly to devise a process which would deal with these issues in a manner that is satisfactory to all the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>In the acute hospital sector, the strike means no elective admissions or theatre lists; no out-patient clinics; and no day hospital services. In general, only emergency services are being maintained. Already the strike has impacted on many people through the cancellation of elective surgery, the closure of day services and the cancellation of out-patient clinics.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Employers Agency has been in discussions with the unions regarding the provision of emergency and essential nursing cover during the strike. As I informed the House last week, some progress was made in arrangements for care. While the continued absence of a nationally agreed framework leaves an element of uncertainty regarding the provision of minimum care requirements at all locations for the duration of the strike, discussions at local level closed the gap considerably in the last few days before the strike. The Nursing Alliance has said it is not the intention to compromise patient care and I am prepared to accept that.</P>
    <P>I would also like to put on record that the co-operation between the management and union sides, where they have agreed and provided emergency cover, is very much appreciated. Those plans were put in place to try to keep the inconvenience to the public to the absolute minimum. The reports available to me to date from around the country bear this out and indicate that thankfully there were no major difficulties on the ground today so far.</P>
    <P>The position as conveyed to me from regional centres regarding acute hospital services is that problems to date have been resolved, with services operating in line with emergency plans agreed with local strike committees. In a number of areas, staffing levels have been increased following review by strike committees. Some unresolved issues are being pursued with the relevant strike committees and unions. This will require <Col N="863" /> constant monitoring and continued co-operation for the duration of the strike.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, accident and emergency departments are busy but at levels that are, in the main, in line with normal levels for the time of year. Services in all three hospitals in the Midland Health Board area are operating in accordance with emergency plans agreed with local strike committees. Accident and emergency services were operating relatively well in the Mid-Western Health Board area. Routine epidural services have been withdrawn and this matter is being pursued with the relevant unions. All hospitals were very busy in the North Western Health Board area but significant problems have not occurred. Staffing levels in the maternity units in Sligo and Letterkenny were increased by the strike committees following review.</P>
    <P>Services in the South Eastern Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas were operating in accordance with emergency plans agreed with local strike committees. Particular problems have not been reported. The numbers awaiting admission through accident and emergency departments in the Southern Health Board area are low and in-patient bed levels were reported to be adequate today.</P>
    <P>Services in the Western Health Board area were generally operating in accordance with the locally agreed emergency plan. Some unresolved issues are being pursued with the relevant strike committee and unions. In addition, management is responding to the strike committee regarding patients scheduled for surgery for tomorrow and Thursday.</P>
    <P>Regarding services to persons with an intellectual disability, from initial information it appears that planned respite services in nearly every agency affected by the strike have been cancelled. Day services, where nurses are employed, have also been badly affected. These services would tend to be the day services used by those with a more severe level of disability. Some residential services have also been closed, but overall these services are operating with disruptions and with minimal nursing care.</P>
    <P>In relation to community health, planned essential services are generally being delivered, which includes nursing services to the terminally ill and the long-term sick patients in the community. Mental health residential services are operating with some disruptions while out-patient and day care services are generally not operating. Regarding services for older people, in general, day care and respite services are not operating. Residential services and public health nursing services are operating with disruptions.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the report of the Commission on Nursing will feature in the process we are trying to put in place to resolve this dispute. The Government remains fully committed to the implementation of the recommendations in the commission's report. While all of the attention has been concentrated on the three pay related <Col N="864" /> recommendations, the commission made some 200 other recommendations designed to tackle the underlying problems within the nursing profession and to develop nursing as a key profession within the health service. The changes proposed by the commission range from reforming the current statutory framework for the regulation of the nursing profession to the introduction of new clinical career pathways for nurses and midwives.</P>
    <P>The commission has taken full account of the future realities within which nursing must be sustained and developed as a profession. The commission's report must be viewed as a significant one in terms of getting to grips with the more fundamental problems of nursing. The commission has provided a framework for improving the way nurses are managed, involving them more in decision making, providing them with new career pathways and empowering them generally in the service. It is important to remember that the nursing profession itself played a central role in informing the deliberations of the commission and in shaping its report, as seven of the 14 members of the commission were drawn from the various strands of the profession.</P>
    <P>Despite the ongoing difficulties with the three pay related recommendations, real and substantial progress has been made over the past 13 months or so in implementing the central recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. I will avail of this opportunity to give an outline of the areas in which change has or is taking place, in response to the commission's proposals.</P>
    <P>On nursing education and training, I have established a representative nursing education forum to prepare the ground for moving pre-registration nursing education from the present three year diploma based programme to a four year degree programme. This forum is proceeding with its work and is expected to report to me by late next year. The whole thrust of this initiative is to place the basic education of nurses on a par with that of other professionals in the health service, something which the nursing profession has been looking for and which the Commission on Nursing has endorsed.</P>
    <P>In relation to nursing and midwifery planning and development units, I have provided funding of £100,000 to each of the eight health boards for the establishment of a regional nursing and midwifery planning and development unit. These units will be responsible for strategic planning and quality assurance of nursing and midwifery services in each health board area. They will also be involved in co-ordinating and improving co-operation between health boards and voluntary bodies in the delivery of nursing and midwifery services.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunately the case that the introduction of these new units has been held up because of disagreement with the INO over the level of salary to be paid to the nurse director of each unit. The view of the INO is that the post holder should be paid the same salary as the director of nursing of a band one hospital. My Department <Col N="865" /> does not consider that the responsibilities of the new position, which is effectively a Monday to Friday strategic planning job, can reasonably be compared with the onerous responsibilities of the top manager of the nursing resource of a major acute teaching hospital.</P>
    <P>On strengthening nursing input at departmental level, since the commission's report was published, the nursing policy division of my Department has been strengthened by the appointment of five additional nurse advisers. This brings to nine the number of members of the nursing profession who are directly involved in contributing to the formulation of overall national policy on nursing. That demonstrates my firm commitment to ensuring that, within my Department, the profession has a real input into policy development.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Health and Children, a particular priority for me has been the greater involvement of nurses and other health care professionals in the management of our health services. Last November, I launched the clinicians in management initiative and provided £2.5 million to get it up and running. This initiative is all about the better running of hospitals and other health care institutions through the participation of clinicians in the decision making process. This involves devolution of responsibility, a process of empowerment for front line staff and an openness to change. For nurses, it means getting rid of the traditional hierarchies and giving them more power in decision making in their own wards and units.</P>
    <P>Clinicians in management is an initiative that involves nurses of all grades. My Department and I stand ready to work with nurses in moving this initiative forward and providing nurses with empowerment across a range of hospital and community settings.</P>
    <P>Ironic as it may seem in the situation in which we now find ourselves, my Department is involved in a joint partnership initiative with the INO in relation to a set of training programmes for nurse managers. These programmes were developed in consultation with the Office for Health Management, the agency with lead responsibility for facilitating management development in the health services. They were introduced to address issues raised in the interim report of the commission, which identified a need for a much greater investment in management training and development to prepare nurses and midwives for positions of authority and leadership within the health care system. Last year, I provided funding of £100,000 for these programmes and I have made available a similar amount this year.</P>
    <P>The objectives of these management development programmes include developing the capacity of nurse managers to lead and manage change and to formulate and implement action plans for the improvement of their own skills and those of their staff. The feedback from nurses who have participated in the programmes is extremely positive and clearly indicates that the <Col N="866" /> objectives are being achieved. In view of the success of the first round pilot initiatives, my Department, the INO and the Office for Health Management have been engaged in discussions on the next round of developments under the partnership. I am committed to providing further funding to facilitate the expansion of these types of programmes, the importance of which is recognised by all the key players.</P>
    <P>One of the first tasks my Department undertook following the publication of the Commission on Nursing report was to arrange for responsibility for the overall management of the nursing applications centre to be transferred to An Bord Altranais. This transfer was recommended by the commission and is fully in line with the enhanced role for An Bord Altranais in the area of pre-registration nursing advocated by the commission.</P>
    <P>I provided funding of almost £400,000 to An Bord Altranais and to various schools of nursing around the country for national and local campaigns to promote nursing as a career. I also provided the necessary resources for additional training places in both general and psychiatric nursing.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that there has been a highly successful outcome to this year's nursing student competitions. A total of 1,221 training places were filled &ndash; 821 in general nursing, 245 in psychiatric nursing and 156 in mental handicap nursing. This is the largest intake of nursing students for several years. I understand from An Bord Altranais that the intakes for psychiatric and mental handicap nursing are records for those nursing streams.</P>
    <P>I am in the process of finalising arrangements for the establishment of a national council for professional development of nursing and midwifery. This new body is a necessary prerequisite to create clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts, as recommended by the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    <P>The importance of this development to nurses, particularly staff nurses, cannot be overemphasised. It will provide them with a new clinical career pathway that does not currently exist, a pathway that will allow them to progress up the promotional ladder without having to leave the patient's bedside. Several hundred new clinical nurse specialist and midwife specialist posts will come on stream. These will be promotional posts at ward sister level and staff nurses and midwives with extensive clinical experience, currently in practice, will be eligible for them. These new nurse specialists will have a maximum salary of £27,522 per year, on foot of the latest Labour Court finding.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will accept that considerable progress has been made in implementing the central recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. This has been done against a background of ongoing industrial relations difficulties since the commission's report was published, in which the three pay related recommendations have over<Col N="867" /> shadowed everything else. I have been seeking, unsuccessfully, to engage the nursing unions in a partnership approach to the phased implementation of all the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. The commission has set out a comprehensive agenda to develop the role of nurses and midwives within the health services. I fervently wish that the moves currently under way to find a process to address nursing issues within the parameters of social partnership will be successful, and that this will allow me and the Nursing Alliance to concentrate our energies, jointly and constructively, on tackling the huge agenda for change set out by the commission. In the final analysis, the commission's report is all about developing the role of nurses and giving concrete expression to the recognition of that role.</P>
    <P>In implementing the commission's recommendations &ndash; and I hope this will soon be possible &ndash; I am anxious to involve the nursing unions in identifying the priority areas where action is required and agreeing strategies for dealing with them. We accept that all of the commission's recommendations cannot be implemented in a single step and that some will, of necessity, take longer than others to implement. That is not to say, however, that we cannot agree a structured programme for the implementation of the report over a period.</P>
    <P>While the situation is being managed, the Government is continuing to monitor the effects of the strike on patient care. The Government is anxious that a process be found as speedily as possible to deal with the issues raised by nurses, in a way that is consistent with existing social partnership agreements and that would facilitate the maintenance of social partnerships into the future. That is not an easy task. The Government has welcomed the willingness of the Nursing Alliance to work to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The Government has asked the relevant Departments and health service employers to explore urgently the possibilities in this regard, so that an early resolution to this dispute may be found. The general purposes committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is being met by Government representatives this evening. I understand that ICTU is hoping to facilitate a process which would help to resolve the dispute. This task, as I have emphasised, is not easy. Talks are ongoing, but very little progress has been made to date.</P>
    <P>However, I assure the House that we will do all in our power to bring the dispute to an end as quickly as possible, emphasising all the time that it must be within the parameters of social partnership. Once a process is devised with the agreement of both sides, that end result would be in the interests of all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his speech, which was rich in detail and indicated some of the complexities of this issue. This will <Col N="868" /> not be an easy issue to resolve. The Minister has made an honest effort to resolve it and it is dishonest not to recognise that. Members on both sides will agree this dispute should not have happened. However, how it could have been stopped is a different issue.</P>
      <P>What we are seeing in this dispute is not just a concern about wages &ndash; the normal issues of industrial relations &ndash; but frustration, which has built up in a profession over the years. This frustration has not been addressed by any Administration. Nurses have, undoubtedly, been taken for granted. They have at this stage, at least, a Minister who is willing to listen to their concerns.</P>
      <P>The Minister has put forward here tonight a variety of innovations in nursing, which are revolutionary. A proper career structure is, at last, beginning to emerge in a profession which has not had one to date. Nurses with whom I have discussed this issue say they have been taken for granted for far too long and have not been listened to, which is undoubtedly true. They point out that there have been remarkable changes in the profession and in technology over the years. Nursing education skills have grown dramatically. They point out that where other professions &ndash; for example, teachers &ndash; have received recognition for years for additional qualifications, they have achieved none. That is changing, and the Minister indicated tonight where he is making changes. All the arguments put forward by the Nursing Alliance with regard to the history of neglect are absolutely true. Moreover, the reason we are having a dispute at this time is that we have not ever taken their case seriously.</P>
      <P>The Government, for its part, faces a major dilemma. It would be dishonest of any Member to suggest that the solution of this problem presents anything other than a dilemma. It is not possible for the Minister to resolve all the problems in nursing in one fell swoop. The Government has conceded very considerable progress in its response to the Commission on Nursing and to the Labour Court findings. In fact, as someone who spent some time as a trade unionist in the public service, I would have been very happy, when I was in the post office workers' union, the clerical officers' union or the executive officers' union, to be able to bring back to the members in my branch any of the concessions achieved by the Alliance over the past period.</P>
      <P>It is worth putting again on the record what has been achieved. Since 1997, an overall increase of 23 per cent has been agreed in nurses' pay, in general. In addition, £88 per week has been agreed on top of the staff nurse salary scale. An additional £144 per week has been agreed in the maximum for ward sisters. An additional increase in annual allowances of three to four times the general rate throughout the public service has been agreed. That is progress, by any standard, and it is a remarkable degree of progress for a union which was, until recently, not regarded as militant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> The trouble for the Government is that any further concessions in this area are bound to cause major difficulties. Within the public service, pay relativity is, as we all know, regarded as absolutely sacrosanct. There can be doubt that if the Government was seen to surrender to pressure in this or any other dispute, the knock-on effect would be dramatic. The peace, tranquillity and progress which we have enjoyed in industrial relations in recent decades would be threatened.</P>
    <P>A degree of cynicism was evident in the speech proposing this motion. It was asked why the Minister was not prepared previously to do what he is doing now. The Minister has given a very interesting, fair and honest explanation of what has happened. There has been considerable change in the past 72 hours on this issue. The Minister has been sending out indications for some time that he has been looking for evidence that the alliance is conscious of the difficulties faced by Government in resolving the issue. This motion, which was mischievously tabled for this evening, is not helpful in that regard.</P>
    <P>On Saturday evening, a spokesperson for the INO gave, on radio, the first clear indication that there was a consciousness of the predicament, that the difficulties were understood, that the Government's predicament was fully appreciated by the INO and that the INO and the other unions in the alliance were prepared to try to put forward constructive steps to deal with those issues. The unions involved must be complimented on taking that first step.</P>
    <P>On Sunday, the INO press statement, as the Minister indicated, gave a further and clearer indication that there was an understanding and a willingness to move in the particular direction which the Minister has been indicating for some time. Within hours, the Minister's response was positive. He issued his own statement saying that if the alliance was genuine in its desire to identify a process, that he would work on it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, we are in uncharted waters. It is very important how we progress this issue to finality, not just from the point of view of nursing and patient care, but from the point of view of industrial peace and progress over the next few years. The Minister has made an honest start. The unions have met the Minister half way. There is now the possibility for progress to address not just the outstanding pay issues, which are significant in themselves, but to make real progress for nursing on the remaining 197 issues for the commission. The Minister has said here tonight &ndash; and we have no reason not to believe him &ndash; that he is anxious to make progress on those issues. He has made more progress in the past two years in resolving the many outstanding issues in nursing than any previous Minister. He should be given the time and space to resolve the issue.</P>

      <P>The unprecedented sight of nurses picketing their hospitals, nursing homes and health centres is an eloquent and tragic testimony to the scandalous failure of the Minister for Health and Children to properly manage our health service. It is clear that, when an overwhelming majority of nurses rejected the Labour Court recommendations a month ago, the Government decided as a tactic not to engage in talks and constructive dialogue with the Nursing Alliance but instead to drive nurses into taking strike action. At a time when the Government refused to enter into dialogue, insensitive and provocative comments by the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance guaranteed an overwhelming vote by nurses in favour of strike action. Talk of nurses as claim jumpers and of their smashing or destroying social partnership drove more nurses to vote in favour of strike action than voted to reject the Labour Court recommendations.</P>
      <P>The concept of social partnership has been used in recent days by the Minister as a weapon to target nurses rather than as a means to find a mechanism to resolve the dispute which has arisen. From the time the strike ballot commenced, instead of trying to resolve the crisis with which we are now confronted, the Government arranged to spend in the region of £250,000 on slick public relations and an advertising campaign with the Orwellian purpose of portraying nurses as public enemies. This politically inspired campaign was up and running and newspaper space was reserved by the weekend, well before the Minister agreed on Sunday evening to an 11th hour meeting.</P>
      <P>Obviously all Members on all sides of the House hope that the meeting which took place yesterday is the first step towards resolving a dispute which should never have happened. If the Minister engaged in such dialogue some weeks ago and also involved the social partners, we would not see nurses taking strike action as they did today. The good working meeting, as the Minister referred to it, which took place yesterday should have been held at least three to three and a half weeks ago. The process now being sought to find a solution could have been devised at least two to three weeks ago and real dialogue undertaken to avoid today's strike.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the talks appear to be talks about talks. The experience of the Northern Ireland conflict over the past two decades has taught us all on this island the importance of dialogue in dispute resolution. It has also taught us that substantial and unnecessary delays can occur in addressing issues of great public importance when groups engage in preliminary skirmishes involving discussions about preconditions and procedural issues. It is not in the public interest that the dialogue which commenced yesterday gets bogged down in preconditions and procedural issues and the discussion of the very real problems which need to be addressed is indefinitely postponed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> There is a duty on Government to ensure a properly functioning health service. Thousands of people across the State should today be in hospital for a variety of different crucial surgical procedures and other treatments. While there are contingency plans in place, it is impossible to know how the postponement of long-awaited surgery or medical consultations will ultimately affect the health and life of those whose surgery or consultations have been indefinitely postponed. There is a genuine concern that, regardless of the cover provided by nurses in our hospitals during the strike period and of assurances given by the nursing unions and the Minister for Health and Children, lives will be lost as a consequence of this strike and the health of many will be permanently impaired as a consequence of delayed access to medical care and treatment.</P>
    <P>Many operations which should have taken place last week were postponed as a result of the threatened strike. As a result of the strike, operations arranged for this week and next week also have been postponed. The legacy of the Minister's failure to engage in constructive dialogue at the beginning of the month is a further escalation of the waiting list crisis. We are confronted, at a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, with the appalling prospect of 40,000 people on our inpatient waiting lists by the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The handling of the nurses dispute by the Government has been nothing short of an industrial relations disaster. By deciding to abandon dialogue and indulge in provocative comments, the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children have contributed to one of the greatest potential health care disasters in the history of the State. The Minister was responsible for the first and one of the largest strikes in the country by nurses. It is obvious that dialogue with the nursing unions should have commenced weeks ago and I am surprised the Taoiseach, with his acknowledged skills of negotiation and conciliation, adopted a contrary approach on this occasion. He reneged when the country really needed his skills of negotiation and he will live to regret it.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate the talks which took place yesterday between the Minister and the nurses did not take place two weeks ago. I noticed a change of mood in his speech this evening. It was much more conciliatory than it was in the past two weeks. If the recent talks had taken place two weeks ago, I doubt if the nurses would be on the picket lines today. That is unfortunate. A settlement will eventually have to be reached. There will have to be give on both sides. This tragedy is something on which there will have to be negotiations and a solution. Why wait until the last hour to do it and why drag it out over the coming weeks? There should be all-night discussions over this weekend and every effort should be made to solve the problem as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> It is wrong that the Government has turned the nursing issue into a battleground and has chosen it to more or less draw a line in the sand for future negotiations. The nursing profession and the nursing issue were the wrong subjects on which to decide to lay down a marker for future negotiations under the next round of pay talks. It was very unfortunate to decide on this issue as the one where the marker would be laid down. The nurses were left with no hope except to resort to strike action. As Gene Kerrigan said in last week's <i>Sunday Independent</i>, the strategy of the Government was obviously to demoralise, defeat and shatter the morale of the nurses.</P>
    <P>There was also a major publicity campaign to shift public opinion against the nurses, but it did not work. Public opinion is on the side of the nurses. I discovered that today from what I saw at the picket line in Tralee where people stopped their cars to tell nurses that they understood their problems, that they should be treated differently and that they are a special case.</P>
    <P>I thought some cases were being catered for but I know of two children who are both bone marrow transplant patients in the high dependency unit of one of the hospitals in Dublin. Their parents have devoted their lives to obtain transplants for them and they are now very concerned about the future health of their children. This is an example of what I have heard. There will be many cases like this if something is not done immediately. I appeal to the Minister as a pragmatist to do everything he can over the weekend and hold all-night discussions if necessary to try to find a resolution of this problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An cheist atá curtha ag a lán daoine ná cén fáth nár labhair sé mar seo roimhe seo. Nach léir go mbíonn ar altraí bheith ag obair ar feath blianta fada sula toileann siad pá ar an ráta uachtarach? Is cuma cé mhéad traenála a dhéanann altra, ní bhíonn ardú pá in ann dóibh. Tuigimid cé chomh tábhachtach atá páirtnéireacht sóisialta sa ghéilleagar, ach tuigeann gach duine cás na n-altraí chomh maith. Cén fáth mar sin nár chuir an tAire ceist ar na grúpaí eile sa Phairtnéireacht Sóisialta dcén fáth ar aontaigh siad gur ghrúpa speisialta le cás faoi leith iad na h-altraí? Dá gcuirfí an cheist seo agus dá bhfaighfí freagra deimhneach bheadh saoirse ag an Aire tairiscint a thairiscint do na h-altraí. Ní h-amháin go bhfuil an tAire leisciúil san aighneas seo ach creidim go bhfuil seisean agus an Rialtas dúr chomh maith. Ar láimh amháin tá ag éirí le comhlachtaí agus le lucht gnó pá agus brabús a mhéadú as cuimse agus cé go bhfuil bancanna lán agus brabús mór acu go léir níl náire ar lucht an tsaibhris nó ar an <Col N="873" /> Rialtas os comhair na n-altraí atá ag obair níos crua ná riamh de bharr easpa altraí. Thairis sin meallann an rannóg phríobháideach altraí as an rannóg phoiblí. Is cuma cad a deir an tAire anseo anocht tá ganntanas altraí sa chóras sláinte. Ní hamháin sin ach níl suim a thuilleadh ag daoine óga san altracht de bharr an gheilleagair.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt Anthony Clare san <i>Sunday Independent</i>: Thirty years ago when [he] came into medicine, the hospitals were bulging with nursing nuns who worked for nothing and lay nurses who worked for next to nothing. Thirty years ago, many young men and women entered nursing because it was an inspiring vocation, promised an interesting life and, to be blunt, because there was little else on offer. Today, young men and women can choose from a cornucopia of occupational possibilities, each interesting in their own way and all paying as much and more than nursing while carrying much less responsibility and risk.</P>
    <P>Tá níos mó airgid ná riamh ag an Rialtas seo. Tá scileanna idirghábhála ag an Taoiseach seo ach tá freagracht ag an Aire seo as an aighneas. Ach cad a chloisimid ón Aire anocht &ndash; services operating relatively well, significant problems have not occurred, bed levels reported to be adequate. Fógraíonn sé seo nach bhfuil aon dul as ag altraí ach aighneas níos mó a chothú. An é seo atá ag testáil ón Aire?</P>
    <P>Mar a dúíirt an Dr. Anthony Clare, is de thoradh an mhargaidh atá aighneas mar seo ar siúl. Ní bheidh aon dul as ag an Rialtas ach an cás a leigheas mar rannóg faoi leith. Is rannóg faoi leith é mar go mbuaileann an t-aighneas seo na daoine is laige, is boichte, is óige agus is aosta sa tír. Creidim go nglacfaidh rannóga eile sa Pháirtnéaracht Sóisialta go bhfuil cás faoi leith ag altraí agus mo náire ar an Aire Sláinte agus Leanaí gan an tuiscint chéanna a léiriú agus gníomhú go luath dá réir. Tá tacaíocht an Chomhaontais Ghlais ag altraí na tíre seo.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It is unfortunate that, in spite of our pleas last week, the strike has gone ahead and the Government has seen fit to allow it to develop to this stage. It is unfortunate that the initiatives which are beginning to take place now did not take place some weeks ago. Instead of negotiating while people were working, negotiations must now take place when services have been withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that services are being upheld throughout the country but the media reports that, within the first four hours of the strike, 1,000 operations were cancelled across the country and, by the end of today, more than 7,000 out-patient appointments will have been cancelled. That is a total of 8,000 people who are immediately affected by the strike. Family doctors are bracing themselves for a 40 per cent increase in their workload and many plan to <Col N="874" /> extend their surgery hours to cope with the huge demand. That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>We must pay heed to The Irish Cancer Society which expressed serious concern today that new cancer patients &ndash; 50 new cases per day &ndash; will not receive any treatment at all and that, in some hospitals, chemotherapy and radiotherapy departments have shut down. The Blood Transfusion Service Board has also expressed concern about the situation. It is worried about the vital blood supplies which could be hit by the nurses' picketing of their headquarters. A specialist clinic which collects blood platelets for cancer patients will also close for the duration of the strike. It is not right to say that the difficulties and delays which have occurred today are not deeply affecting people.</P>

      <P>We have heard the Minister and the Government speak about the issue of relativity throughout this debate. I appreciate it is a problem which must be dealt with. Nurses' work has changed dramatically over the past ten years. There is now a requirement for a different level of skills and knowledge and a different approach by nurses, as a result of which their status has changed. Medical technology has changed dramatically over the past 15 years and nurses have had to deal with that. I did not hear either the Government or the Minister saying that nurses do not deserve a pay increase. Nobody has made the case that they should not receive a pay increase, rather that it would create relativity problems. That must be dealt with in the public service as it has been in the private sector.</P>
      <P>If nurses are entitled to an increase in pay because of their increased skill levels and their changed situation, it must be recognised and nurses must be adequately remunerated for that. It is not acceptable to say that their pay is relative to that of firemen or prison officers. Nurses must be paid according to their value, skills and knowledge. Nurses are being told that they cannot be paid an increase because others might also claim increases.</P>

The only person who can stop it is the Minister by being realistic and talking to the nurses until a solution is arrived at. In Northern Ireland, the parties spoke to each other for hours on end and produced the Good Friday Agreement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter in the House this evening and I do so with a great sense of urgency. I will speak about the huge problem which currently besets 34,000 sheep farmers.</P>
      <P>This has possibly been one of the worst weeks in the sheep trade for many years. Many marts managers and farmers have told me in recent days that, because of the factories reducing their prices to almost unrealistic levels, we are now at a stage where many sheep farmers will be put out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not here tonight, he should be. It appears he has utter contempt for sheep farmers. This week the price collapsed <Col N="876" /> again and we have reached a stage where farmers have to accept prices which are almost 50 per cent below those of last Easter. That is how bad the situation is. There was sheer disbelief that the Minister would not take a more proactive role in getting a better market for Irish lamb and, above all else, initiate negotiations in Brussels to have the position of Irish sheep farmers brought into line with those in the European Union. When the Minister waved the white flag on sheep policy on the fringes of Agenda 2000 some months ago, he clearly signalled to Irish sheep farmers that they do not count. Sheep farmers are not getting fair play.</P>
    <P>Throughout the European Union, as the Minister well knows, sheep farmers are in receipt of the same level of ewe premium. Whether one is in Germany, France, Holland or Ireland, one gets the same ewe premium, despite the fact that farmers in other countries get between £10 and £12 more each for their lambs. Obviously, the method of calculation is wrong and that has been the position for the past two or three years. For whatever reason, the Minister of State and the Minister want to turn their backs on those people. Under Agenda 2000, sheep farmers were left out again when they were excluded from extensification payments. That was the only stock on the farm which was excluded. They were counted for livestock units but excluded for payment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the position in relation to lambs procured outside the State and slaughtered at Irish meat factories? It is necessary that all the regulations concerning animal health are enforced. There must be a determined effort to raise the awareness of the Irish consumer as regards the relative superiority of Irish lamb products over imported products. In addition, there should be a concerted effort to ensure that the Irish housewife gets the best value in lamb, given the poor prices farmers are getting.</P>
    <P>At a time when others outside the agriculture industry are talking about an economic miracle, it is remarkable that the Government has turned its back on farming people, but that is nothing compared to what they have done to sheep farmers. This week lambs, which would have sold for £45 to £50 six months ago, are selling for £30. Cast ewes were sold this week for prices as low as £2 to £15 and there is almost no trade for store lambs. In other words, the whole trade has collapsed. There is no confidence and unless there is an immediate intervention by the Minister to try to ensure that Irish farmers get fair play in Europe, we will have a lot fewer sheep farmers in Ireland next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this important matter and for his concern. I hope he will listen to what I have to say. In the <Col N="877" /> early part of this year Irish sheep producers enjoyed reasonably satisfactory prices and at Easter these were over 20 per cent higher than the same time last year. However, in recent weeks prices have been low. It is alarmist to say that there has been a collapse in sheep prices this week. While the Minister would like to see them well in excess of the present levels of 86p to 88p per pound, this is a higher price than had been available at some stages in the early autumn.</P>
      <P>The present difficulties in the market stem largely from increased supplies of UK lamb which have depressed returns from the French market. We export 70 per cent of our sheepmeat and three quarters of this is marketed in France. Consequently, any changes in the French market have an impact on the Irish sheepmeat trade. Another factor is that French lamb is perceived by consumers to be superior to imported product and, as a result, they are willing to pay premium prices for domestically produced lamb. Unfortunately, we are very much at the mercy of the trade activities in the neighbouring UK market which has a lamb output six times greater than that of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken a number of measures to help address the difficulties in the sector. In response to representations which the Minister made to the EU Commission, a scheme of aid for private storage was agreed at a specially convened meeting of the sheepmeat management committee on 17 September. The objective of this scheme is to take up to 130,000 lambs off the market in Ireland and the UK. The Minister is happy there has been strong interest in the scheme and Ireland's allocation under this scheme has now been fully taken up. More important from our point of view is that 115,000 lambs were taken off the UK market, which can only benefit our market. The Minister is confident that this scheme will play a part in restoring market confidence to the sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also requested An Bord Bia to follow up the potential for developing new markets in southern Europe. In addition, An Bord Bia has conducted an autumn promotion campaign on the domestic market to encourage demand by informing consumers about the positive qualities of Irish lamb, about which there is no doubt and about which we all agree. The theme of this campaign was that lamb is a healthy convenient food. In addition, there has been a retail based promotion campaign of mountain lamb as a speciality food.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was obviously unaware of it when he was speaking. I have a <Col N="878" /> press release if he would like to hear it. This will benefit the sheepmeat sector by £25 million and comes at a useful time for hard pressed sheep producers.</P>
      <P>The sheepmeat forum, which the Minister set up last year, has now submitted its report. Membership of the forum included representatives of all those involved in the sheepmeat sector and it was charged with assessing how best the industry can collectively address the challenges it faces in the coming years. The report contains a number of recommendations which will help to improve the overall position of the industry, including the income of sheep producers. The Minister is looking forward to working with the industry to successfully implement these recommendations.</P>
      <P>Lower producer prices should be reflected in lower retail prices which, in turn, should boost demand. There is a need to bring pressure to bear on retailers to pass on lower prices. Meat factory owners should show solidarity with their Irish suppliers by concentrating on domestic produce, notwithstanding temporarily lower prices for other produce. The Minister is aware that the current ewe premium system can be improved and has again taken up with the Commission the issues of an adjustment to the retention period and removal of the stabiliser. There is little support from other member states or from the Commission for changes which might make the system more equitable from Ireland's point of view. The Minister will, however, continue to push for changes to the sheepmeat regime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to remind the Minister that the agriculture sector is in serious crisis at the moment with the collapse in beef, sheep and pig prices. The farming community is devastated and demoralised at present. Nowhere is this more evident than in my county of Kerry and in places such as west Limerick and north Cork which are serviced by Fenit port. I am making a special appeal to the Minister to allow the live export of cattle from Fenit port. It is estimated that a saving of between £25 and £30 per animal would be made if live exports were allowed from the port.</P>
      <P>I realise the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has raised a number of issues as regards the use of Fenit port for live exports. As I understand it, only a limited operation is proposed, confined to about eight to ten shipments of weanlings to Spain from late August to early November. Each shipment would consist of approximately 900 weanlings, so the total number exported would not exceed 9,000 animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the vessel which would transport these animals has been raised. The specialised livestock ship, the <i>Angus Express</i>, which I understand has been approved for this purpose, <Col N="879" /> has been chartered for the duration of the operation. The harbour master in Fenit is satisfied that this vessel can be safely loaded in Fenit. However, there may be restrictions related to tidal movement as to when loading can take place to avoid excessive gradient on the loading ramp.</P>
    <P>The question of lairage has also been raised. There is no proposal to set up a lair in Fenit, as there is not the space for it on the pier and there would be problems preventing slurry getting into the harbour. Any veterinary inspection of animals, weighing or documentation of animals must be done elsewhere, then the animals can be brought to Fenit in sealed trucks and discharged from the trucks straight on to the ships. Lairage could easily be provided in Kingdom Mart, which is only four miles away.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to form a secure chute approximately 40 feet long by placing 20 foot containers along the quay at right angles to the ship's ramp. The trucks would be backed into one end of the chute and the gates of the truck, when open, would be tied into the containers so that there is no possibility of animals escaping. If necessary, extra barriers could be placed from the containers to the sides of the truck to give double protection. The weanlings would be released from the pens on to the truck, one pen at a time, so that there would not be more than 12 to 15 animals in the chute at any one time. The weanlings would then be herded into their pen on the ship before the next pen on the truck could be opened. Hay, straw and water can be loaded on the vessel before, during or after the loading of animals.</P>
    <P>The Harbour Commissioners, who are seeking blue flag status for their marina, are very conscious of the need to prevent any pollution of the harbour with cattle slurry. Consequently, the Commissioners will insist that the trucks be straw lined, as would the chute and loading ramp. Thus there would be no runoff of liquid slurry. After loading, the straw would be immediately removed from the harbour area in a skip. The Harbour Commissioners are also very conscious of animal welfare. They would ensure that all procedures would comply with the highest standards and that there would be no protestors; people would not be concerned about the operation as the Commissioners would ensure it conformed to the highest standards.</P>
    <P>About 20 ships per annum use the port and there is more than enough room to handle cattle shipments. The two major customers are Irish Shell, which imports oil, and Liebherr Container Cranes, which exports cranes. The export of live cattle can be easily accommodated here. I appeal to the Minister of State on behalf of the farmers of Kerry, north Cork and west Limerick in particular to give this sympathetic consideration. I hope he has a positive announcement to make.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for raising this matter. I have a few things to tell him. Live exports are an important element of our national economy. The live trade is essential for price competition and farm incomes and makes a major contribution to the economic well-being of thousands of livestock farmers and their families. The Government is firmly committed to the development of the live export trade and there is ample evidence which demonstrates this commitment. I was taken aback by Deputy Deenihan as he held the position I now hold a few years ago. He did not talk about the number of cattle exported in that time, as it was minimal.</P>

      <P>A particular characteristic of our 1999 export figures is the growth in the trade to continental Europe &ndash; almost 233,000 cattle have been shipped to the Continent this year, compared with just under 91,000 in the corresponding period of 1998. While 1998 was regarded as a good year relative to the years which immediately preceded it, it can be said that our performance on the live export trade this year is truly extraordinary. I compliment those in the livestock trade who have secured export markets for Irish cattle and who have made possible the level of performance in the live trade which we are seeing in 1999.</P>
      <P>I am happy that my Department has played its part in facilitating these developments. We have ensured the timely inspection of vessels which are proposed for the carriage of livestock from Ireland. Where we are satisfied that vessels are suitable, we have ensured that approvals are issued with the minimum of delay. The number of dedicated livestock vessels approved by the Department for the carriage of livestock from Ireland now stands at 17, as compared with just nine in 1996. That is some progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, approval to carry livestock has been given to three companies which operate ro-ro services to continental Europe several times each week. The Department has within the past fortnight approved an increase from ten to 14 in the number of livestock trucks which may be carried on each voyage by the company operating the Cork-St. Malo route. Ensuring the welfare of the animals involved is an integral part of the live trade and the Department attaches particular <Col N="881" /> importance to this aspect and will continue to pay it close attention.</P>
    <P>Department personnel are also necessarily involved in clearing animals at the ports for export. The huge growth in export numbers has placed additional pressures on these Department staff, to which they have responded in a very committed and professional manner. They too have played a very important part in facilitating our currently buoyant live trade and I note their contribution.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of approving cattle exports out of Fenit, County Kerry. My Department has been approached by the port authorities at Fenit and others in support of the case that cattle export operations out of Fenit should be facilitated. Last month the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development met a delegation from Kerry County Council on the same issue. I visited Fenit, which is a lovely place and an important part of north Kerry, on the occasion of the burial of the late Councillor Noel Brasil, a colleague of Deputy Deenihan's.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining this issue of cattle exports out of Fenit, having regard in particular to the facilities available there and the resources implications involved and we will shortly arrive at a decision. The best method of exporting small cattle and weanlings is roll-on, roll-off. The walk-on, walk-off system does not give the best quality animals arriving at the destination. That is well known, though it is only in the past 12 months it has been discovered. That size of animal does not travel well, as Deputy Deenihan will know, coming from a single suckle livestock rearing area &ndash; that is the kind of animal we are talking about.</P>
    <P>Whatever the outcome, it should be pointed out that facilitating the export of cattle from Fenit will displace rather than add to cattle exports from other ports, and will not thereby result in any overall increase in the numbers of cattle being exported from Ireland. The crux of the matter is whether under a number of headings there would be a net gain from effectively relocating to Fenit a proportion of live export operations and whether this would represent a sensible use of available resources. As I have said, we expect to be in a position shortly to make decisions on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing grants are very important to people with disabilities in enabling them to live independently in their own homes and have proved their value over the years. It is crucial that people with disabilities can be inde<Col N="882" /> pendent and stay at home rather than be cared for by others or have to move to an institution. These grants have been very valuable in this regard.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because the local authority of which I have been a member for many years, Limerick Corporation, has run out of funds for the disabled person's grants. I have spoken to other colleagues, such as Niamh Bhreathnach, who has told me that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has also run out of funds, while Kerry County Council has just about run out in recent weeks. I know that Clare County Council was allocated £160,000 and that it has had to spend money from other sources; it has already spent £280,000 this year and predicts that by the end of the year it will have spent approximately £350,000 on disabled person's grants.</P>
      <P>I have to be fair and say that other local authorities have enough money and have not run out of funds. There is an uneven distribution of funding to local authorities under the disabled person's grant scheme. I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, earlier this year concerning problems I had been having with my local authority. He indicated that the allocation appeared to be in line with the needs in local authority areas, but that is not the reality. I know of several people who applied to Limerick Corporation who have been told that they will have to wait until next year's funding before their grant can be processed. The applications can be processed but the money cannot be spent until next year.</P>
      <P>In many cases people cannot wait, particularly where an illness has resulted in a disability and where a house needs to be adapted quickly. I am dealing with one case in which a husband had to adapt his house for his wife's needs. He could not wait until next year and I am trying to see if he can receive retrospective funding. However, that is not in accordance with the rules. I know of another case in which a woman with terminal cancer has been told she must wait until next year. The needs of people with disabilities can change and even though they may have received a grant, they may need a second grant, which is generally not available.</P>
      <P>There have been improvements in the scheme. The maximum amount has been raised but it needs to be increased further because of the increased costs of renovations due to the housing crisis. Some people do not qualify for the full grant if they own their own house. In its pre-budget submission, the Carers Association recommends that, where necessary, the grant should cover 100 per cent of the cost required. Just because people own their own homes does not mean they can afford the 25 per cent of the cost they are required to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to look at the grant scheme. At a time when the economy is flourishing it is particularly stingy if we cannot ensure <Col N="883" /> that people with disabilities who need a grant to adapt their homes do not receive the amount they require. The amount involved is small and any local authority which does not have enough money to fulfil these needs should be allocated the necessary funding. This issue should be examined in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising on the Adjournment this matter regarding the disabled person's grant scheme. The scheme is administered by the local authorities and is designed to provide substantial assistance to householders to carry out necessary adaptations or improvements to dwellings to facilitate disabled members of the household. A grant of up to three quarters of the approved cost of the work is available in the case of a privately-owned house and the total cost of works in the case of a local authority dwelling. Typically, the type of work covered by the scheme would be the provision of downstairs accommodation and services for a wheelchair user, the widening of door openings and lowering of plug points to allow free access to all the facilities in the dwelling, or any works necessary for the proper accommodation and treatment of disabled members of the household.</P>
      <P>The Department's involvement relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants. The disabled person's grant scheme is funded at local authority level from the authorities' own resources and within the constraints imposed by the amount included for that purpose in the local authorities estimates of expenditure. Global expenditure limits are set for this scheme in the form of capital spending allocations from the Department and are based on estimates of demand for the schemes provided by the authorities. Local authorities were notified by the Department in circular letter H4/99 of 30 April 1999 of their global capital allocations for this year for the payment of disabled person's grants, essential repairs grants and allocations for house purchase and improvement loans. Local authorities have discretion as to how they divide their allocation between these various measures. For 1999, allocations to local authorities were in line with the amounts sought by the authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to housing authorities to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand under the scheme. The circular letter advised authorities to contact the Department if additional allocations were required. To date, no local authority has applied to the Department for an increase in its allocation to allow increased expenditure on disabled person's grants. Any reasonable application for an additional capital allocation would be dealt with expeditiously by <Col N="884" /> the Department. However, it should be noted that an application to the Department for an increased capital allocation for these schemes would not of itself allow increased expenditure by the local authority under any scheme without a corresponding upward revision of the authority's estimates of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements to the terms of the disabled person's grant scheme were announced in December 1998. The grant payable was increased from two thirds of the approved cost of the work undertaken to three quarters of the approved cost. Recoupment from the Department to local authorities in respect of grants paid was also increased from 50 to 66 per cent and the maximum recoupment was increased from £4,000 to £8,000. These improvements, in practical terms, allow local authorities to pay an effective maximum grant of £12,000, as opposed to £8,000 previously, at no additional expense to them. This, in effect, allows authorities to increase their overall expenditure on disabled person's grants by 50 per cent without adding to their net expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no pleasure to raise this matter but I am doing so because this tender has caused outrage on Clare Island. Chris O'Grady and his family operated the ferry service for many years. Over the years, Mr. O'Grady fought to get a ferry service for the island. Some years ago he started the service which was the only ferry service to the island. He was doing so before the Department paid any subsidy. The Gaeltacht islands had an advantage which the non-Gaeltacht islands did not enjoy. Mr. O'Grady fought with many Taoisigh to secure this service but he was badly treated by the Department and the Minister this year. It was not the time to have a go at him as he lost his wife and father-in-law this year and his son was in a serious accident.</P>
      <P>How can any Department give a tender or a licence to someone who does not have a boat? An individual obtained a licence on 1 September. That person then bought a boat which went into service on 8 October. This issue will not finish here tonight. I have nothing against the person who bought the boat. However, I would have applied for this tender if I knew I was going to be successful and I would then have bought the boat. Mr. O'Grady put his life's savings and his life's work into buying a boat. The boat which was awarded the tender can only carry passengers, it cannot carry cargo or animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will write to Deputy Jim Mitchell, Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, to ask that he investigate the tendering process as there was major political interference in this case. I am sorry the Minister with responsibility for this mat<Col N="885" /> ter is not in the House but there was political interference in this case as no Minister could give someone without a boat a licence to operate a ferry service.</P>

      <P>If everything was equitable and everything was right, I would have no problem but everything was not equitable and right. There was political interference. I will get this investigated by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Minister and the officials in the Department who took part in this will be obliged to answer to the general public because there was misconduct in that Department when it allocated a licence to somebody who did not have a boat.</P>
      <P>Tonight I want an answer from the Minister and I do not want him to read the Civil Service script which will state that everything was above board. Everything was not above board. A licence could not be given to somebody who did not have a boat. If I knew that I would get the contract for three years, I would have applied for that licence. Why did he not apply last year? He did not have a boat. Why did he not apply the year before? He did not have a boat. He did not have a boat when he made the application to the Department and it awarded him a contract. Political skulduggery is what I call it.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow I will write to Deputy Jim Mitchell, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, to ask the committee to call the officials and the paperwork. I requested the paperwork under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and of course an official told me it would take months to process it. They gave me some answers but tomorrow I will write to Deputy Mitchell.</P>
      <P>I hope this will not happen again. I am sorry that this has been a bad year for Mr. Chris O'Grady and his family. He and his family have employed many people on Clare Island over the years. They run the local hotel.</P>

      <P>First, I apologise for the absence of the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, the Minister with responsibility in this area. Tenders for this service were sought by open competition, with advertisements in the national and local newspapers. In addition, a number of ferryboat companies known to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands were invited to tender. The tenders that were received were considered by officials of that Department under the normal criteria. These criteria included price, suitability of the vessels&mdash;</P>

      <P>Two tenders were received, one of which was considerably in excess of the other. As a result it was necessary in the interest of the taxpayer to consider further the proposals submitted in the lowest tender. It was stated in this tender that while the tenderer in question did not yet have the vessel for which he was quoting in his possession he would acquire same if his tender were successful but that it needed some modifications, which would take a number of weeks and might not be ready by 1 September 1999.</P>
      <P>A preliminary report on the boat was sought from an inspector of navigation of the waterways division of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This report indicated that the boat was almost new and should be suitable subject to some modifications and the acquisition of the necessary passenger boat licence from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to enable it to operate in the environs of Clew Bay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered all relevant factors, including the delay beyond 1 September, the date on which it was proposed to commence the subsidised passenger ferry service, and the difference between the prices quoted by the tenderers, officials recommended that the cheaper tender be accepted, subject to the usual conditions, including his having all the necessary certificates before commencing the service. The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands accepted that recommendation and understands that the vessel is now in service and <Col N="887" /> has been licensed to carry a maximum of 46 persons.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that there is no suggestion that the quality of service provided in the past was not satisfactory. A monitoring committee consisting of officials from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and representatives from the Clare Island community was satisfied that the service was very good. <Col N="888" /> However, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív has no reason to believe the service under the new contract will not be equally good. Deputy Ó Cuív wishes to assure the Deputy that all the proper procedures were followed in this case. I hope that clarifies the position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 66, 86, 97, 134 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>In October 1998, I directed the Chief of Staff to arrange for the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans that would give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Pricewaterhouse report.</P>
      <P>I received the draft implementation plan for the Naval Service on 30 September 1999, and it is currently being examined in my Department. I understand that the draft Air Corps implementation plan was delivered to my private office at the end of last week, but I have not yet had an opportunity to study it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pricewaterhouse's 1998 report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service set out a range of recommendations for more effective and efficient <Col N="890" /> air and sea services. Some of these recommendations can be proceeded with fairly quickly while others will take longer. As with the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, the changes in the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be of a positive nature aimed at ensuring the ongoing development of these services consistent with the needs of the State and those of the taxpayer. It is important that the recommendations be implemented in a structured and coherent way that will contribute to the overall development of the Defence Forces as a whole.</P>
    <P>With regard to the broader development of both services, this will be dealt with in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Defence which I plan to bring forward by the end of this year. The White Paper presents a positive opportunity to develop the Defence Forces for the long-term.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the Air Corps and Naval Service, Pricewaterhouse examined a range of comparative models, including both the United States coast-guard service and the Scottish Fishery Protection Agency. Furthermore, the Pricewaterhouse project team included personnel who were familiar with other countries fishery protection and coastguard services. The report that they produced was based on the consultants' experience and familiarity of a wide range of coast guard models, but which was tailored specially for the Irish context.</P>

    <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan (1996-1998), which was approved by Government in March 1996, provides for a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the first line reserve made up of former <Col N="891" /> members of the Permanent Defence Force, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November 1997 I announced the setting up of a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process, the chief of staff established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. Part of the function of the steering group was to oversee and guide the military board in its task. The steering group recently completed its examination and submitted a draft report which I am currently in the process of examining. As indicated previously I plan to publish the steering group report in due course.</P>
    <P>However, pending completion of consideration of the draft report I do not intend to make any comment on the findings or recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that an in-depth study of the reserve has now been undertaken involving a considerable amount of work by both the military board and the steering group. The military board, as part of its task sought the views of the membership on the future organisation and structure of the reserve. From the outset there was ongoing liaison between the steering group and the military board and meetings of the steering group were attended in part by either the chairman or the secretary of the military board who kept the group well briefed on the board's progress. The steering group also advised the military board regarding aspects of the reserve that should be examined or that should be looked at in greater depth by the military board.</P>
    <P>The steering group met with each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, who made presentations to the group regarding their areas of concern, and it met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association which also made presentations to the group.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 48 and 141 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Corps fleet comprises 18 fixed wing aircraft and 14 helicopters, including one fixed <Col N="892" /> wing aircraft and one helicopter operated by the Air Corps on behalf of the Garda Síochána. The number and types of the fixed wing element of the fleet are as follows: two CASA CN-235, one Gulfstream IV, one Beech Super Kingair, seven Siai-Marchetti SF 260W, six Cessna and one Defender 4000 (Garda). The helicopter element consists of the following: seven Alouette III, two Gazelle, four Dauphin 365F and one Ecureil AS355N (Garda).</P>
    <P>The aircraft which are more than 20 years old comprise all of the Siai-Marchetti, five Cessna, one Gazelle and all of the Alouette III. The remaining aircraft were purchased within the last 20 years: one Cessna, 1981; one Gazelle Helicopter, 1981; one Beech Super Kingair, 1980; four Dauphin 365F Helicopters, 1984/1985; one Gulfstream IV, 1992; two CASA CN 235, 1994; and one Defender and one Ecureil (Garda), 1997.</P>
    <P>All of the aircraft mentioned are operational and undergo regular maintenance and scheduled overhauls to ensure that they are fully airworthy and meet the certification standards laid down for the aviation industry. In the circumstances it is not proposed to withdraw them from service at present.</P>
    <P>The longer term development of the Air Corps, including the question of future aircraft requirements, will be dealt with in the context of the White Paper on Defence, which I plan to have available by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I asked the Chief of Staff to prepare, in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps, a draft implementation plan for my consideration, to implement the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made by the consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers in their review of the Air Corps. The draft plan from the Air Corps was received very recently and will be considered as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>A court of inquiry was initiated immediately following an accident which occurred at Kilworth Firing Range on 9 December 1997 in which five Defence Forces personnel were injured, one seriously. The inquiry encompassed the findings of a military police investigation and a technical board of inquiry. Weapons handling training on the 60mm mortar continued but live firing for training purposes ceased pending completion of the aforementioned investigations. The report submitted to higher military authority gave rise to additional queries which could only be addressed by the reconvening of the court of inquiry and this was done. The report of the reconvened court of inquiry is currently being reviewed by the military <Col N="893" /> authorities in order determine what, if any, changes to drills and procedures should be made in respect of live firing with the 60mm mortar on training exercises. Until this review is completed the military authorities have continued the suspension of live firing with the 60mm mortar.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 73 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to announce recently that I had authorised the opening of negotiations between my Department and Mowag of Switzerland in regard to the completion of a contract for the supply of armoured personnel carriers to the Defence Forces. This followed the completion of the technical assessment of two vehicles selected by the Department to compete in the second stage of the competition which had been in progress since last year. Those negotiations are continuing with the purpose of defining the final technical specification to meet the Department's requirements and to establish the financial and other aspects of the proposed contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the successful completion of these negotiations, I expect that a contract will be concluded shortly and that the first vehicles will be delivered to the Defence Forces towards the end of next year.  The possibility of accelerating pro<Col N="894" /> duction to achieve full delivery of the remainder of the vehicles as early as possible will be explored in negotiations with the supplier.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and in the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as those which apply to men. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces I decided last year to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 5'4".</P>
      <P>The table which I propose to circulate with the Official Report indicates the number of women within the Permanent Defence Forces as of 30 June 1999, the most recent date for which such figures are currently available due to the ongoing restructuring and reorganisation of the Defence Forces. These figures provide a breakdown between officers and various non-commissioned ranks across each of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
      <P>Strength of Females Defence Forces as on 30th June, 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 70, 130, 136 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>Following the accident at Tramore, County Waterford, on 2 July 1999 in which four members of the Air Corps were tragically killed, my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise and I jointly directed that the accident be investigated under Statutory Instrument Number 205 of 1997 &ldquo;Air Navigation (Notification and Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1997&rdquo;. Pursuant to this direction the investigation is being conducted by the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A senior Air Corps officer with appropriate training is acting as investigator-in-charge. He is being assisted by inspectors from the AAIU, by Air Corps personnel and two experts from overseas, that is a principal inspector from the UK air accidents investigation branch and the head of military psychology of the Swedish Armed Forces.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this investigation, which is wide ranging and complex, is to determine the circumstances and cause or causes of the accident in order to prevent future such accidents. The report of this investigation will be made public. The regulations provide that the report should be published, where possible, within 12 months of the date of the accident. There is no provision for the publication of preliminary findings. Any safety measures proposed by the investigating team will, of course, be implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>In addition to the aforementioned investigation, a military court of inquiry has been convened to inquire into the circumstances of the accident. Its main thrust will be an examination of both the report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Public Enterprise and the coroner's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of future equipment requirements for the Air Corps will be dealt with in the <Col N="897" /> context of the White Paper on Defence, which I plan to bring forward by the end of the year. I might add that following the review of the Air Corps which was carried out by consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers I asked the Chief of Staff to prepare, in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps, a draft implementation plan for my consideration, to give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made in the consultant's report. The draft plan was submitted in the past few days and is under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>Commencing in 1999, there are net savings of about £15 million a year arising from the voluntary early retirement scheme. It has been agreed that half of these savings will be made available to provide additional funding for equipment and infrastructural programmes for the Defence Forces. In that regard an additional sum of £7.5 million was provided under subhead G &ndash; Defensive Equipment &ndash; of this year's Defence Vote.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 56, 67, 77 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>There were 11,139 personnel serving in the Defence Forces at 30 June 1999, the latest date for which such figures are available. The 1999 General Service Enlistment Recruitment Campaign was advertised in February, with a view to the enlistment of some 550 recruits to the Permanent Defence Force in 1999. To date, some 375 recruits have already been enlisted and a further 85 are expected to be enlisted over the coming weeks. Furthermore, interviews in connection with a further planned intake of general service recruits this year are currently taking place. I have also authorised the intake of an additional 100 recruits in 1999. As the Government's policy of continuous recruitment is being maintained, I would envisage no difficulty in reaching the full recruitment quota for 1999.</P>
      <P>While it has not been possible in the time available to compile a comprehensive categorisation of persons who left the Defence Forces up to the end of September, I am advised that some 89 recruits were discharged during initial training. There was an enlistment of 375 general service recruits, four Naval Service radio radar technicians, two pharmacists, one medical officer, 17 Naval Service apprentices, 58 cadets and 15 Air Corps avionics apprentices. Proposals for direct entry competitions for marine engineer officers and watchkeeping officers are at an advanced stage. Vacancies which have arisen at non-commissioned rank are being filled internally by promotion and vacancies created in the lower ranks consequent on these promotions are being filled by the continuous recruitment process.</P>
      <P>In 1999, a total of 647 applicants were called for medical examination for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force. Some 78 failed the medical examination. Of these, 14 failed the audiometric test. The figure for applicants who failed the eyesight examination due to colour blindness is not available as they are classed as having failed the overall medical examination.</P>
      <P>The numbers of males and females who were enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force in 1999 are as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 57 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>The ongoing recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address any shortfalls in personnel numbers in the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service. To date in 1999, a total of 53 general service recruits have been enlisted in the Naval Service. The Naval Service will continue to enlist general service recruits during the remainder of 1999 and again in the course of the year 2000 to address manpower shortages.</P>
      <P>A special recruitment campaign for general service recruits launched specifically for the Naval Service in September 1999 has already attracted some 400 inquiries. To date, approximately 100 applicants have been called for interviews which commenced on 11 October 1999 in Cork, Waterford, Dublin and Athlone. Additionally, 17 apprentices and four radio and radar technicians have been enlisted this year and a number of personnel have transferred from the Air Corps to take up radio radar technician appointments. On 20 September 1999, eight Naval Service cadets were enlisted and are currently in training in the cadet school, Defence Forces training centre. They will return to the naval base in January 2000. Proposals for the cadet competition for 2000 are currently being finalised by the military authorities.</P>
      <P>Two non-commissioned personnel are due to be commissioned as electrical engineer officers on 3 November next and proposals for direct entry competitions for marine engineer officers and watchkeeping officers are at an advanced stage. Vacancies which have arisen at non-commissioned rank are being filled internally by promotion and vacancies created in the lower ranks consequent on these promotions are being filled by the ongoing recruitment process.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility for internal security rests with the Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required. This entails assisting the Garda at roadblocks, checkpoints and searches including in the Border area. The Defence Forces also assist the Garda in relation to prisoner escorts, cash escorts and explosives escorts.</P>
      <P>Requests to the Defence Forces by the Garda in relation to Border duty include the provision of armed parties for the purpose of protecting Garda and the carrying out of duties such as vehicle checkpoints and mobile security patrols, specialist search team tasks and explosive ordnance disposal tasks. It is not the practice, for security reasons, to give details, such as numbers of patrols or checkpoints, relating to these operations.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces will continue as necessary to respond to requests from the Garda for aid to the civil power in the Border area. The level of demand on the Defence Forces in aid of the Garda in the Border area following on the Good Friday Agreement is kept under review in my Department in consultation with the relevant Departments, that is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Foreign Affairs as well as with the Garda authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>As I advised the House earlier this year, a number of meetings have taken place between my Department and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, with a view to using St. Bricin's Military Hospital as a step down medical facility into which certain categories of civilian patients could be transferred. Agreement in principle was reached on the introduction of a pilot scheme under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods ranging from seven to ten days. If the pilot scheme is successful it is intended that a long-term arrangement involving up to 20 civilian patients at a time will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was recognised by all of the parties involved that a range of issues would have to be addressed <Col N="901" /> before the pilot scheme could commence and some preparatory work has already been carried out in St. Bricin's in this regard.</P>
    <P>Overall responsibility for the health and well-being of civilian patients in this country rests with the Department of Health and Children and it is essential that, in order to discharge its duties and responsibilities, that Department fully satisfies itself concerning all of the arrangements pertaining to the transfer, accommodation and treatment of civilian patients while in St. Bricin's Hospital. The Department of Health and Children has advised the Mater Hospital of its requirements in this regard, and it is understood that the matter is currently being pursued by the hospital authorities. A number of legal and insurance issues must also be resolved.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Health and Children has satisfied itself fully with regard to the above requirements, it will formally approach my Department to request that St. Bricin's Hospital provide the facilities described above. In the meantime, I remain committed to the successful implementation of the pilot scheme and the matter will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Following the recent completion of contracting work a total of 53 bed spaces are currently available in St. Bricin's Military Hospital. An additional 27 bed spaces in ward No. 3 are available as reserve in-patient accommodation.</P>
    <P>The hospital also has a potential 30 bed spaces in ward No. 5. However this ward is in need of very substantial refurbishment, including repairs to its roof. As sufficient beds are available for the admission of military patients, it is not proposed to carry out this refurbishment work at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 89, 99, 135 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>In the four year period from 1997 to 2000, inclusive, it is estimated that more than £250 million will have been invested in the purchase, up-grading and maintenance of equipment (weapons, ammunition, transport, communications, clothing, etc.) used generally throughout the Defence Forces and of equipment specific to the Air Corps and Naval Service. The amount in respect of 1999 will be in the region of £65 million. It is my intention to continue with, and expand where possible, the modernisation programme to ensure that the Defence Forces are equipped to the highest standards appropriate to their roles and, on finalisation of the Estimates for my Department for 2000, I am confident that the expenditure level indicated will be maintained. The amounts referred to are inclusive of the savings from the voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to investment in new accommodation and the maintenance and up-grading of existing buildings the amount for the four year period to 2000 will be more than £80 million. Expenditure in 1999 will reach about £19 million. These figures comprise a provision for building construction and maintenance similar to that included in the Vote in recent years and an additional significant allocation arising from the expected proceeds from the sale of barracks.</P>
      <P>The longer term development, including the question of future equipment requirements, of the Air Corps and the Naval Service will be dealt with in the context of the White Paper on Defence, which I plan to have available by the end of this year. However, in the meantime, I asked the Chief of Staff to prepare, in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service, draft implementation plans for my consideration, to implement the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made by the consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers in their review of the two services. I have just received the draft plans which are now being considered.</P>

      <P>Approximately 30 members of the Army ranger wing have been deployed to INTERFET. Participation by the Defence Forces will be for an initial period of four months with the possibility of a replacement contingent serving for a further period of four months to mid-June 2000. Among the factors taken into account when considering the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas are security considerations at home. I am satisfied that the number of Army ranger wing personnel who remain at home is adequate to meet the current requirements and that it will not be necessary to recruit additional personnel to the unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 10 October 1999, the search and rescue crew in Waterford, using an Alouette helicopter, was tasked with the recovery of an injured woman who had fallen down a cliff at Ardmore Head. The casualty was located on a ledge at the base of a 150 foot high cliff. Around ten people were with the casualty. She had been transferred to a spinal board and was receiving treatment. The location of the casualty meant that a lift using the hoist on the helicopter would be required. The winchman was winched out and as the helicopter approached the overhead position a foil &ndash; thermal &ndash; blanket, which was covering the casualty, lifted into the air. The aircraft commander observed this but, owing to the critical phase of the approach, with the winchman on the cable, avoiding action was not possible. The aircraft commander then lost sight of the blanket. It would appear that the blanket became enmeshed in the main rotor for a short period of time and subsequently tore away. The aircraft was moved away from the cliff face and the winch operator commenced winching in the winchman. Once the winchman was aboard, the aircraft was landed and inspected. No significant damage was found.</P>
      <P>The helicopter crew then went on foot to access the casualty. The winchman abseiled down the cliff face and confirmed the urgent need to transfer the casualty to hospital. It was decided to re-start the helicopter and, provided that it performed satisfactorily, complete the lift of the casualty and transfer to hospital. This was carried out successfully. The age of the aircraft is not relevant to the incident as any helicopter could have been affected in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Air Corps will write to the various agencies with whom they work in search and rescue <Col N="904" /> and associated roles in order to re-emphasise the need for ground based personnel to be aware that lightweight items, such as foil &ndash; thermal &ndash; blankets, must be removed from the helicopter's working area, or if necessary, be strongly secured.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of claims received up to 14 October, 1999 is 14,588. The number of serving members of the Defence Forces who have lodged claims is 4,362. Of these, 3,046 claims remain outstanding, while 1,316 have been disposed of by 70 court awards or 1,185 settlements at a cost of £28,583,062. Forty seven cases were withdrawn and 14 dismissed. An additional £9,453,057 has been paid in respect of plaintiffs' legal costs, giving an overall total of £38,036,119.</P>
      <P>A total of 10,227 claims have been received from former members of the Defence Forces and 137 have received awards and 1,185 have been settled at a cost of £40,583,754. Plaintiffs' costs have amounted to £15,098,599 making a total of £55,682,353. A total of 7,450 cases are still outstanding. The average quantum of damages per claim for the period January to September 1999 was £12,228. This is reduced from an average of £30,874 in 1996. Details in respect of expenditure and numbers of claims per month in 1999 are set out in the tabular statement which will be circulated with the official report.</P>
      <P>Deputies may recall that when I last answered questions on this subject on 30 June, 1999, I mentioned that the establishment of a compensation scheme will be influenced by the outcome of the appeal in the case of Hanley <i>v. </i>Minister for Defence. I understand that the Supreme Court may deliver this shortly. When this important judgment is published, the details will be examined carefully in my Department. Its implications for all outstanding claims and for the establishment of a compensation scheme will be assessed and costed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the projected cost is acceptable to the Government &ndash; I hope it will be &ndash; I shall establish a scheme designed to remove these claims from the courts. This will provide a level of com<Col N="905" /> pensation which will be fair and equitable both to the tax payer and to those personnel who have suffered hearing loss during military service. It will also be administratively straightforward, providing a relatively speedy process of compensating claimants based on the green book and the Supreme Court's judgment. The scheme will also be designed to reduce the very high level of costs <Col N="906" /> inherent in resolving these claims through the courts.</P>
    <P>I hope the establishment of a compensation scheme based on an acceptable tariff will attract a consensus of support among all of us who are concerned with resolving this issue and putting its negative consequences behind us.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the questions refer to the issue of having military service allowance, MSA, included in the calculation of pensions of Defence Forces personnel who retired before 1 August, 1990. I refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 244 and 252 on 29 September 1999. As I indicated then, the position of pre-August, 1990 Defence Forces' pensioners will be further considered in the light of the final report of the Commission on Public Service Pensions and of any relevant Government decisions thereon. The Commission is scheduled to make its final report to Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels. At any given time there would generally be three or four vessels on patrol. A new fishery protection patrol vessel, the <i>LE Roisin,</i> is currently undergoing acceptance tests and sea trials prior to delivery within the next few weeks. Consideration is also being given to the question of the purchase of another fishery protection vessel similar to the<i> LE Roisin</i> as a replacement for the <i>LE Deirdre</i> which has completed almost 28 years in service.</P>
      <P>The ongoing recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Defence Forces, which I have approved, is designed to address any shortfalls in personnel numbers in the Defence Forces, including the Naval Service. To date in 1999, a total of 53 general service recruits have been enlisted in the Naval Service. It is anticipated that the Naval Service will enlist a further significant number of general service recruits in the remainder of 1999 and again in the course of the year 2000 to address manpower shortages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special recruitment campaign for general service recruits launched specifically for the Naval Service in September, 1999 has already attracted some 400 enquiries. To date, approximately 100 applicants have been called for interviews which commenced on 11 October, 1999 in Cork, Waterford, Dublin and Athlone. Additionally, 17 apprentices and four radio and radar technicians have been enlisted this year and a number of personnel have transferred from the Air Corps to take up radio radar technician appointments. On 20 September, 1999 eight Naval Service cadets were enlisted and are currently in training in the cadet school, Defence Forces training centre. They will return to the naval base in January 2000. Proposals for the cadet competition for <Col N="907" /> 2000 are currently being finalised by the military authorities.</P>
    <P>Two non-commissioned personnel are due to be commissioned as electrical engineer officers on 3 November next and proposals for direct entry competitions for marine engineer officers and watchkeeping officers are at an advanced stage. Vacancies which have arisen at non-commissioned rank are being filled internally by promotion and vacancies created in the lower ranks consequent on these promotions are being filled by the ongoing recruitment process.</P>

      <P>A member of the Naval Service is normally posted to a naval vessel for a deployment period of two years. During this period the ship is operational &ndash; away from base on patrol &ndash; for approximately 180 days per annum. This operational period is made up of two or three week patrols separated by similar periods back at base on maintenance. In the normal course of events, he/she would then be posted to a shore appointment for a two year period and this cycle would then be repeated.</P>
      <P>Because of manpower difficulties in the service, particularly in certain grades, it is not always possible to offer the desired even ratio between seagoing and shore duty. In order to achieve this desired balance between seagoing and shore duty for all its personnel, the objective of the Naval service is to fill all vacancies in the establishment through a range of recruitment and other specialist induction initiatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The timetable for the White Paper will depend on the completion of the necessary consultative and planning work. Subject to the satisfactory <Col N="908" /> completion of this work, I plan to bring my policy proposals to Government later this year. Once these proposals have been agreed by the Government, my intention is to publish the White Paper as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This will be the first ever White Paper on Defence. It will provide a framework for the evolution of national defence policy and the continuing reorganisation process in the Defence Forces. Overall, the White Paper presents a positive opportunity to map out a strategy for the development of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, the objectives of the White Paper are to provide a medium term policy framework within which Defence policy can evolve; to set out a clear strategy for the next ten years; to provide for the continuation of the reform program of Defence services already commenced under the Defence Forces review implementation plan, consistent with the national and international security environment and the state of the public finances; to ensure that the management of defence services is in accordance with the evolution of the strategic management initiative centrally; and to set out the basis for the future development of Civil Defence policy and the follow-up to the present Towards 2000 strategy.</P>

Because of this, and as mobile technology advances, it is the Department's practice to review the position and issue new phones as necessary.

      <P>The question of the appointment of an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been raised by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions at conciliation and arbitration are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996. The revised procedures provide for the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister. All complaints, other than the most trivial or vexatious, are referred to him by the Minister. The agreement also provided that the revised complaints procedures should operate on a trial basis <Col N="910" /> for two years, after which a review of the procedures should take place. This review is now being undertaken by sub-committees of the conciliation council established for that purpose. I have no wish to interfere in their deliberations but I will say that it is vital that all members of the Defence Forces have confidence in the outcome of that review. It should not be beyond us to create a procedural formula for dealing with grievances that satisfies all concerned and at the same time maintains that ethos of the military way of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
      <P>With the exception of Clancy Barracks, which will be vacated by 1 July 2000, the other five barracks have been evacuated.</P>
      <P>I propose to meet members of Fermoy Urban District Council and officials of Cork County Council, on 21 October 1999, to discuss a tender from Cork County Council relating to Fitzgerald Camp.</P>
      <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I have decided to sell the site to the North-Eastern Health Board for £600,000. The legal and financial formalities have yet to be finalised. In the meantime I propose to allow the North-Eastern Health Board occupy the property under a caretaker agreement.</P>
      <P>As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been re-zoned for housing in line with the Development Plan for Naas UDC, which was adopted on 29 May, 1999 and this property will be offered for sale in the near future. It is proposed to invite tenders for the appointment of selling agents in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks <Col N="911" /> to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Currently Magee Barracks, Kildare, is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. In the interim, tenders from independent consultants are under consideration for the preparation of an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. The consultants will submit a report within three months of appointment. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>Following a tender competition for the appointment of independent consultants to draw up an integrated action area plan for Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, consultants were appointed on 23 August 1999. That plan is due for completion by 23 November 1999, and the property will be disposed of following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>In addition, as a contribution to alleviating the shortage of land for housing, especially in major cities and towns, I decided that the following properties adjoining barracks should be sold:</P>
    <P>&ndash;Susan's Field, Collins Barracks, Cork (6 acres)</P>
    <P>&ndash;Old Married Quarters, Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick (2.5 acres) and</P>
    <P>&ndash;Mellowes Field, Renmore Barracks, Galway (10 acres).</P>
    <P>An area of 1.5 acres of the barracks in Waterford City, which is used by the FCA, is also to be sold. The four properties will be disposed of as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is constant pressure on the relevant authorities with regard to suitable land for housing and it is considered that the sale of these prime properties in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will go some way towards relieving that pressure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 133 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>On 12 October 1999 the Dáil approved the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the multinational force in East Timor (INTERFET), established under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1264 of 15 September 1999. The contingent which compromises 40 personnel, including 30 personnel from the Army Ranger Wing (ARW), departed for Darwin, Australia on 13 October, 1999. They will deploy to East Timor on or about 22 October, 1999 following training and acclimatisation in Townsville, Australia. Participation by the Defence Forces in INTERFET will be for an initial period of four months, with the possibility of a replacement contingent serving for a further period of four months to mid-June 2000.</P>
      <P>The contingent is in addition to the three officers of the Permanent Defence Force who are deployed since July, 1999 with the UN mission in East Timor (UNAMET). It will be recalled that all personnel of the UNAMET mission were evacuated from East Timor on 17 September 1999 in view of the prevailing security situation. The three personnel will continue with UNAMET now that the mission has returned to East Timor.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to increase the size of the present Defence Forces contribution to either INTERFET or UNAMET.</P>
      <P>The total number of Defence Forces personnel currently serving with UN missions is 843. This number is subject to fluctuation in line with changes in mission strengths, repatriations etc. Requests for personnel of the Defence Forces to serve on overseas missions are considered on their merits in the prevailing circumstances within the context of the United Nations stand-by arrangements system (UNSAS). Among the factors taken into account when considering the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas are security considerations at home and the level of existing overseas commitments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>In recent times a number of approaches have been made by private concerns regarding the possible use of facilities at Baldonnel Aerodrome. My main concern, in examining these proposals, would be to protect the military aviation interests at the aerodrome. The question of extending usage of these facilities for hire or reward requires careful consideration as it may have implications regarding licensing of the facility for commercial use. However, the greater utilisation of this underused resource could have benefits for both military and civil aviation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The use of Baldonnel for civil aviation purposes is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Public Enterprise in consultation with myself in the context of overall airports policy generally. In that regard I am aware that advisers have been appointed jointly by the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance to assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's report on its future strategic direction.</P>
      <P>This report will help in assessing the position of Baldonnel against that wider policy backdrop. I understand that the advisers will complete their work in the near future. Following consideration of the report it is intended that the Minister for Public Enterprise and myself will report to Government with specific proposals in respect of Baldonnel.</P>

      <P>The following arrangements apply in the Defence Forces regarding comments on political matters; Defence Force regulations prescribe that &ldquo;The granting of interviews or the divulging of information by any officer or man of the Permanent Defence Force to members of the public on matters pertaining to the service or to the conduct thereof is forbidden.</P>
      <P>Comment, if any, in publications, lectures, broadcasts or talks, touching on questions of a political nature &ndash; whether national or international &ndash; shall avoid strictly any reference which might be construed as being of a controversial nature.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are no formal guidelines which apply specifically to senior officers. However, a tradition of strict political neutrality has governed senior public service managers since the foundation of the State and senior military officers have always been governed by that tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, there has been a growing public interest in defence and security issues. As a consequence, a more wide ranging public debate has ensued. Given these changed circumstances, guidelines may now be appropriate. While I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy's view of Partnership for Peace, I share his underlying concern that members of the Defence Forces should not make any comment whatsoever on matters of a political nature or on matters which are for decision by Government or which will come before either House of the Oireachtas for dis<Col N="915" /> cussion or decision. The reason for this is simple. We live in a democracy and politicians are answerable to the people.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to have the current regulations reviewed so as to ensure they meet present day requirements and that every member of the Defence Forces is fully familiar with, understands and adheres to their content.</P>

Accordingly, in November 1997 I announced the setting up of a joint civilian/military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process, the Chief of Staff established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve.

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, pending completion of consideration of the draft report I do not intend to make any <Col N="917" /> comment on the findings or recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    <P>The question of members of the FCÁ undertaking overseas service with units of the Permanent Defence Force is one of the aspects of reserve service that was examined by the study groups. General criteria governing selection for overseas service come within the scope of representation. Any matters relating to overseas service by members of the reserve which come within the scope of representation will be raised with the associations at the appropriate forum.</P>

      <P>The <i>LE Roisin</i> is currently undergoing acceptance tests and sea trials prior to delivery which is due to take place within the next few weeks. On arrival at the Naval Base, Haulbowline, crew training will be undertaken and the fitting of additional Naval Service equipment which was not included in the ship build contract will be carried out. The training involved will cover all aspects of the operation of the new vessel and its equipment. The vessel will be formally commissioned into the Naval Service on completion of this training and will be operational immediately thereafter.</P>
      <P>Consideration is being given to the question of the purchase of another fishery protection vessel similar to the <i>LE Roisin</i> as a replacement for the <i>LE Deirdre</i> which has completed almost twenty eight years in use to date and is approaching the end of its economic service life.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service carried out a total of 1,176 boardings up to the end of September, 1999. As a result of these boardings 26 vessels were detained and 157 were given written warnings for infringements of fishery legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic <Col N="918" /> zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary. Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 128, 132, 158 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.</P>
      <P>With the exception of Clancy Barracks, which will be vacated by 1 July 2000, the other five barracks have been evacuated.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision, I had consultations with public and community representatives in each of the five locations in which barracks were subsequently evacuated. In addition to those initial meetings, I met with members of the Oireachtas and local councillors in relation to Castleblayney Barracks on 3 February, 3 March, and 15 July 1999; local Councillors and officials from Naas Urban District Council on 3 March, and 10 March 1999, in relation to Devoy Barracks, Naas, and I have met with councillors and an official of Kildare County Council on 14 September 1999, in relation to Magee Barracks, Kildare. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> Discussions also took place between my officials and officials of Cork County Council on 2 December, 1998, in relation to Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, and Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. I propose meeting with members of Fermoy Urban District Council and officials of Cork County Council, on 21 October 1999, to discuss a tender from Cork County Council relating to Fitzgerald Camp.</P>
    <P>In relation to Castleblayney, I have decided to sell the site to the North-Eastern Health Board for £600,000. The legal and financial formalities have yet to be finalised. In the meantime I propose to allow the North-Eastern Health Board occupy the property under a caretaker agreement.</P>
    <P>As regards Devoy Barracks, agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been re-zoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC, which was adopted on 29 May 1999 and this property will be offered for sale in the near future. It is proposed to invite tenders for the appointment of selling agents in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Arising from a request from the Department of Foreign Affairs for accommodation to house Kosovar refugees, I offered that Department the opportunity to inspect the five vacated barracks to check out their feasibility or otherwise for the accommodation of the refugees. Currently Magee Barracks, Kildare, is being used for this purpose on a temporary basis. In the interim, tenders from independent consultants are under consideration for the preparation of an area action plan in respect of the former barrack lands. The consultants will submit a report within three months of appointment. The sale of the barracks will proceed as soon as is practicable following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>Following a tender competition for the appointment of independent consultants to draw up an integrated action area plan for Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, consultants were appointed on 23 August 1999. That plan is due for completion by 23 November 1999, and the property will be disposed of following evaluation of that report.</P>
    <P>The total cost, to date, of security and essential maintenance and other services at the vacated military barracks is as follows :</P>

    <P>The costs for security at Magee Barracks have been borne by the Eastern Health Board since that property was handed over to accommodate Kosovan refugees on 12 May, 1999.</P>
    <P>The military authorities have estimated that the savings to date on security duty allowances amount to over £375,000. In addition, there have been significant savings on utilities such as telephone and electricity charges.</P>
    <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be realised from the sale of the barracks.</P>

      <P>Section 121 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, specifically prohibits financial institutions from imposing redemption fees on borrowers who wish to redeem their housing loans, mortgages, early except in certain circumstances. The exceptions to the prohibition, which are set out in section 121(2) of the Act, occur in circumstances where the loan agreement provides that the rate of interest: (a) may not be changed, or (b) may not be changed over a period of a least one year, or (c) may not, for a period of at least five years, exceed the rate applicable on the date of the making of the said agreement by more than two per cent.</P>
      <P>Where financial institutions apply redemption fees in accordance with the circumstances of section 121(2), they are obliged to provide a statement outlining how the charge is to be calculated. It is a requirement that this statement be included in the mortgage application form and in other documents, such as loan approval forms, produced by the institutions.</P>
      <P>Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act requires credit institutions to notify the Director of Consumer Affairs of all charges for services to customers. This includes mortgage lenders in relation to the manner in which they calculate redemption fees in respect of fixed rate loans which are redeemed early.</P>

      <P>Any women wishing to return to the workforce can avail of the services of FÁS, either for employment placement or for training, and such supports can frequently be more appropriate than going into programmes such as CE. I am satisfied that through its action programme, Women in Focus, FÁS is ensuring that women have every opportunity to participate fully on FÁS programmes. More than half of the participants on the CE programme in 1998 were women and women accounted for 54 per cent of trainees on FÁS training programmes that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community employment programme is designed to specifically target persons at most disadvantage in the labour market. As a result of the restructuring of the CE programme, approved by Government on 21 July 1999, married women <Col N="924" /> classified as qualified adults, adult dependants of long-term unemployed persons are now eligible to participate in CE. I have no plans at present to further expand the eligibility conditions for married women for CE or associated programmes.</P>

      <P>The Crafts Council of Ireland has commissioned National Industrial Fire and Safety Training to update their health and safety statement, which will include anti-bullying measures.</P>
      <P>Bullying can take many different forms, and organisations need to be proactive in this area and not allow bullying activities to go unchecked. My Department acknowledges the need for organisations to create an environment which does not encourage or condone bullying.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte is the agency with primary responsibility for the international promotion of tourism in Ireland. In practice, however, the fisheries boards work closely with Bord Fáilte in the development and promotion of angling tourism.

This investment programme is being supported by a specific marketing initiative this year to promote Irish angling abroad. A sum of £400,000 (including £300,000 in European Regional Development Fund funds) was transferred from TAM to fund the programme for 1999 which has been agreed and is being administered by Bord Fáilte in co-operation with the CFB and my Department.</P>

      <P>The Department has been aware of this case for some time and has been pursuing with the Department of Health and Children the feasibility of bringing this person to Ireland for a liver transplant. This does not appear to be a viable option because there is a specific process for assessment of liver function to determine requirement for and suitability for transplant. As this person has not been assessed, the Department of Health and Children is not in a position to confirm whether this candidate is suitable for the liver programme. In addition, there is a considerable waiting time involved in finding a suitable liver match.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Irish Bosnia Aid group is now exploring the possibility of a liver transplant operation in Belgium and is seeking contributions towards the costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the advisers which were appointed jointly by myself and the Minister for Finance to assist in the examination of Aer Rianta's strategic direction will complete their work in the near future. While I have not been presented with a draft of the advisers' report, I understand that officials of both Departments have recently received a draft of the report for discussion purposes with the advisers with a view to finalising the report in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Following the receipt of their report and consideration of their recommendations, I will consult with my Cabinet colleagues in the normal way and then report to Government with specific recommendations in regard to the future of Aer Rianta. It would not be appropriate for me at this point to speculate on what those recommendations will be.</P>
      <P>Any decision on the future strategic direction of Aer Rianta, including any decision in relation to the future ownership position of Cork airport, will be a matter for Government.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that one of the criteria to qualify for the grant under the farm electrification grant scheme is that that applicant must occupy and farm at least three hectares in a disadvantaged area which, in many instances, rules out full-time farmers in disadvantaged areas who are involved in intensive farming in mushroom productions or in the marketing and processing of farm products who have less than the qualifying rate; and if she will change these qualifying criteria in view of the fact that it is excluding many full-time farmers employing people in disadvantaged areas.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm electrification grant scheme was introduced in 1990 and is a carry-over of the EC funded western aid package scheme, FEOGA, which was discontinued due to exhaustion of its financial allocation.</P>
      <P>The grant scheme is designed to subsidise the cost of installation of electricity to farms which previously had no supply or where supply is inadequate in those areas of the country which have been designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The eligibility criteria for the farm electrification grant scheme were revised in 1994 to bring them in line with similar schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. To qualify for grant aid, an applicant must practise farming on land owned or held on long-term lease, farming must be the applicant's main occupation and principal source of income and, as the Deputy has mentioned, occupy and farm at least three hectares, 7.5 acres, in a disadvantaged area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> Applicants who do not qualify for grant aid under the farm electrification grant scheme can avail of ESB's deferred payments option. This allows applicants pay a deposit to ESB and the balance over a period of one to five years.</P>
    <P>I have no immediate plans to review the terms of the scheme but if such a review takes place in the future the concerns expressed by the Deputy will be borne in mind. In any event the current level of funding available to me for the scheme would not accommodate an expansion of the eligible cases of the type implied in the question.</P>

      <Quest>the record, if any, her Department has of any allegations ever having been made in reference to the granting of aviation rights to Ryanair on the routes to Liverpool, Stansted and Munich from Dublin Airport in the 1989 to 1999 period.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20631/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 1989, the then Minister for Tourism and Transport announced a new policy for Irish aviation, known as the &ldquo;two airline policy&rdquo;. The Minister granted exclusive rights to Ryanair to operate from Ireland to Luton and Stansted and from Dublin to Liverpool and Munich. At the same time, exclusive rights were granted to Aer Lingus to operate from Ireland to Heathrow and Gatwick and from Dublin to Manchester and Paris. These rights were granted for a finite period of three years to the end of 1992, i.e. in the run up to the liberalisation of the EU air transport market.</P>
      <P>I am not certain what precisely the Deputy is seeking in his question. The records on file over the period while the two airline policy was in existence reflect criticisms of the policy from a number of perspectives, as might be expected in the case of any significant change of policy. All of these criticisms were in the public domain at the time.</P>
      <P>The above is based on review of the principal relevant files. To determine whether there is any data on other files would involve examination of a considerable number of records in my Department. If the Deputy wishes to pursue the matter further, it would be helpful and would narrow down the search considerably if he would be more specific about what he has in mind.</P>

      <P>The infrastructure work on the DART extension to Greystones was completed <Col N="931" /> earlier this year and a partial service was originally planned to commence in late summer.</P>
      <P>However, the introduction of this service has been delayed due to ongoing industrial relations issues. The Labour Court issued an interim recommendation urging the unions to lift an embargo on the training of newly recruited drivers and the testing of the line while the court was considering the substantive issues. Subsequently the Labour Court issued its final recommendation on 3 August and this proposed an £8,000 <i>ex gratia </i>lump sum payment to serving DART drivers in full and final settlement of all issues before the court. Neither recommendation was accepted by the drivers. Subsequent discussions between unions and management have not managed to find a solution and claims have since been put forward on behalf of other groups in Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>Until the industrial relations issues have been resolved it will not be possible to give an estimated start-up date for the Greystones DART service. However, Iarnród Éireann has informed me that once the current dispute is settled it will take approximately six weeks to test the line before introducing a partial service.</P>

      <P>The incident to which the Deputy is likely to be referring occurred on 30 March last when the Dublin to Galway railway line was obstructed by objects on the line near Castledaly, County Westmeath. An unidentified obstruction was struck by the 13.05 p.m. Heuston to Westport passenger train and appears to have been thrown clear by the impact of the train. The line was then inspected and was found to be clear of obstacles.</P>
      <P>However at 15.46 p.m. the 14.25 p.m. Heuston to Galway passenger train struck another obstruction some distance from the first incident. This consisted of a short section of rail which appears to have been placed in the path of the train. The obstacle travelled under the train, causing damage to the engine sump and to the underside and braking systems of a number of carriages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the company that this obstacle could have derailed the train which <Col N="932" /> would have placed the staff and passengers on the train in danger.</P>
    <P>It is understood the Garda is pursuing an investigation into the incidents. As regards Iarnród Éireann taking a civil action arising from the incident that would be a matter for the company and I would have no function in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Numbers 125, 131, 154, 160 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>By 14 October 1999, my Department had received 14,588 claims for alleged loss of hearing from current or former members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The number of serving members of the Defence Forces who have lodged claims is 4,362. Of these 3,046 remain outstanding while 1,316 have been disposed of. Seventy claims were the subject of court awards while 1,185 were settled out of court. The total cost of awards and settlements of these claims is £28,583,062. An additional £9,453,057 has been paid in respect of plaintiffs' legal costs, giving an overall total of £38,036,119.</P>
      <P>Details in respect of expenditure and numbers of claims per month in 1999 are set out in a tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Deputies may recall that when I last answered questions on this subject on 30 June 1999, I mentioned that the establishment of a compensation scheme will be influenced by the outcome of the appeal in the case of Hanley<i> v. </i>Minister for Defence. I understand that the Supreme Court may deliver this shortly. When this important judgment is published, the details will be examined carefully in my Department. Its implications for all outstanding claims and for the establishment of a compensation scheme will be assessed and costed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> If the projected cost is acceptable to the Government &ndash; and I am hopeful that it will be &ndash; I shall establish a scheme designed to remove these claims from the courts. This will provide a level of compensation which will be fair and equitable both to the taxpayer and to those personnel who have suffered hearing loss during military service. It will be administratively straightforward, providing a relatively speedy process of compensating claimants based on the Green Book and the Supreme Court's judgment. The scheme will also be designed to reduce the very high level of costs inherent in resolving these claims through the courts.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the establishment of a compensation scheme based on an acceptable tariff will attract a consensus of support among all of us who are concerned with resolving this issue and in putting its negative consequences behind us.</P>
    <P>The amounts paid out in respect of hearing loss settlements and awards since 1994 to date are: £3.32 million in respect of 207 court awards; £65.85 million in respect of 3,665 out of court settlements and £24.55 million in respect of 3,174 claims where legal costs have been paid to date. The total cost to date is, therefore, close to £93.72 million.</P>
    <P>Administrative costs are currently estimated at approximately: £750,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Department of Defence; £850,000 per year for staff and overheads in respect of the Defence Forces and £795,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Chief State Solicitor's Office. A total estimate for administrative costs is, therefore, £2,395,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The total number of cases outstanding is 10,496.</P>

      <P>Following the deployment on 13 October 1999 of a contingent comprising 40 members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the multinational force in East Timor, INTERFET, the total number of Defence Forces personnel currently serving with UN missions is 843. This number is subject to fluctuation in line with changes in mission strengths, repatriations etc.</P>
      <P>Requests for personnel of the Defence Forces to serve on overseas missions are considered on their merits in the prevailing circumstances within the context of the United Nations Standby Arrangement System, UNSAS. Among the factors taken into account when considering the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas are security considerations at home and the level of existing overseas commitments.</P>
      <P>I am happy to report that there are sufficient volunteers to fill all appointments in the 86th Infantry Battalion UNIFIL, which is due to depart for Lebanon tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>The only missions for which Ireland is entitled to reimbursement of troop costs by the UN are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, UNFICYP. Troop costs in respect of these missions are calculated at the rate of $1087.10 US per person per month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> The total amount owing to my Department by the United Nations, as at 30 September 1999, in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Force personnel in UN missions was calculated at IR£9.5 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Continuous efforts are made to recover from the United Nations the moneys owed. These efforts are strenuously pursued with the United Nations on an ongoing basis by the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York. Both my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I take every opportunity to raise with the UN Ireland's concerns regarding arrears. During the visit of the UN Secretary General to Ireland the opportunity was taken to raise Ireland's concern about arrears owing in respect of our participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Since 1 January 1999, the UN has repaid arrears of £3 million approximately, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>The additional cost to the Vote for Defence in each of the years 1995 to 1999 arising from participation by the Defence Forces in overseas missions is approximately as follows: 1995, £8.7 million; 1996, £8.7 million; 1997, £8.5 million; 1998, £8.5 million; 1999, £6.5 million to 30 September 1999.</P>
    <P>The above figures include, for example, costs of overseas allowances, temporary promotions, preparation of contingents and travel on leave.</P>

The applicant must first apply for transfer to his-her commanding officer. The applicant must be recommended for transfer by his-her commanding officer. A vacancy must exist in the proposed corps-Slua Muirí. The applicant must satisfy the proposed corps-Slua Muirí that he/she is: qualified to fill such a vacancy; prepared to be reduced in rank, where necessary, to fill such an appointment for which he/she is qualified-in some cases this may be a reduction in rank to private or seaman rank; prepared to undergo such courses and training as to enable him-her to qualify for his-her new corps or an Slua Muirí and prepared, in the case of a transfer to Slua Muirí, to undergo vision and colour tests.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the position in relation to students and teaching staff of the former Army apprenticeship school at Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare; the nature and extent, if any, of arrangements entered into with both or either parties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of the teaching staff employed at the former Army apprentice school, Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, are currently employed at the signals school, Curragh. At present, the Department of Education and Science is actively pursuing the possibility of redeployment to institutes of technology of the remaining staff members, in consultation with the staff concerned and with their trade union. The possibility of voluntary early retirement under the relevant Department of Education and Science schemes also arises in some cases. My Department is keeping in touch with the Department of Education and Science in the matter.</P>
      <P>There were 28 apprentices at the Army apprentice school in Devoy Barracks prior to the closure of that barracks. Of these, 18 attended the Dublin Institute of Technology, either at Bolton Street or at Kevin Street for the purpose of completing their final &ldquo;off the job&rdquo; training module which consisted of ten weeks. These 18 apprentices were variously training as motor mechanics, carpenters and electricians. They commenced their attendance at Dublin Institute of Technology in late January and completed it at the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining ten apprentices, who are training in electronics/commmunications, have relocated to the School of Signals on the Curragh. <Col N="938" /> They will now complete their technical training in the middle of 2001.</P>
    <P>In 1998 the average cost of training an apprentice had reached the level of £100,000 per annum. This was clearly unsustainable.</P>
    <P>When the closure of the apprentice school was announced, I gave an undertaking that every individual student would be given the opportunity to complete their training. I am informed by the military authorities that the new arrangements have worked very satisfactorily and that the standard of instruction provided has been excellent. As promised all the students either have completed, or are continuing on to complete, their apprenticeships.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that, in future, Army apprentices will attend at FÁS and-or regional technical college courses for their formal &ldquo;off the job&rdquo; training. This is already the long established situation with Naval Service apprentices. The apprenticeship needs of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps are kept under regular review. Apprentices will continue to be recruited for specific trades and crafts, as and when required, in response to identified service needs.</P>

      <P>Agreement has been reached between my Department and Naas Urban District Council on the transfer of part of the property to the council for local purposes. The balance of the property has been rezoned for housing in line with the development plan for Naas UDC, which was adopted on 29 May 1999, and this property will be offered for sale in the near future. In this regard, tenders have been invited for the appointment of selling agents to undertake the sale.</P>
      <P>I will be taking the advice of the Valuation Office on the property's potential value but ultimately market forces will determine its actual value.</P>
      <P>To date the cost of security amounts to £130,213.66 while the costs of maintenance, including the provision of lighting etc. total £2,463.</P>
      <P>While the cost to date amounts to £565,416.94 in respect of all vacated barracks, the military authorities have estimated that the savings to date on security duty allowances amount to over £375,000. In addition, there has been significant savings on utilities such as telephone and electricity charges.</P>

    <P>The implementation plan also provided for special studies to be carried out on the Naval Service and the Air Corps and Pricewaterhouse management consultants were engaged to conduct these reviews. In its report, Pricewaterhouse Coopers recommended slight adjustment in the respective strengths of the Naval Service and the Air Corps to 1,144 for the Naval Service and 930 for the Air Corps.</P>

I appreciate the importance of the fallen animal collection service within the wider context of the livestock sector and deem reasonable charges for collectors and farmers alike to be of great importance in this context.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation in July 1998 providing for the reopening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts. This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997. The Libyan Government, through the General People's Committee, formally cleared the agreement before the end of September of that year and written confirmation to this effect was received.</P>
      <P>Despite the agreement, there has been a delay on the part of the Libyan authorities in putting it into effect in relation to live cattle exports. This delay is of serious concern both to myself and the Government. Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities, through every appropriate channel, with a view to ensuring the agreement is implemented in practice. I visited Lybia in August and there has been correspondence from the Taoiseach to the Libyan leader since then.</P>
      <P>While a recent Irish bid for the supply of live cattle to Libya unfortunately was unsuccessful, I remain hopeful that the Libyan agreement will be honoured in full and will continue to take every appropriate measure to ensure this outcome.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there are no impediments to the export of weanlings from this country. Exports of live cattle are up by 167 per cent this year on last year, that is, 198,688 as against 112,070 for the same period last year. The vast bulk of these exports relate to calves and weanlings shipped to continental Europe.</P>

The derogation applies until 31 December 1999 and will continue to apply automatically for subsequent periods of two years, unless the Council decides unanimously before the end of that period on a proposal from the Commission whether the derogation should be abolished or modified. It is understood that the Commission will present proposals on this and on other derogations later in the year. Any such proposals will have to be considered.

I am forwarding copies of the booklets to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Under the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994, employers, including Civil Service departments, are obliged to provide new employees with a written statement setting out specified details of the employee's terms of employment, including details of the terms and conditions relating to pensions and pension schemes.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As disablement benefit has always been treated as income for tax purposes the Deputy is probably referring to disability benefit, which has been reckonable as income for tax purposes since 1993.</P>
      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments are therefore reckonable as income for tax purposes. Treating such benefits as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity. Long-term social welfare payments have been taxable for many years. Taxation was extended to disability benefit in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to improve the position of those adversely affected by extending taxation to disability benefit, certain changes were introduced: to assist families, the child dependant additions payable with disability benefit were made exempt from income tax from 6 April 1995; the 1997 budget announced certain concessions in relation <Col N="951" /> to the taxation of disability benefit arising from commitments in P2000. For the 1997-98 tax year the first three weeks of disability benefit were made exempt from tax while the exemption was increased to the first six weeks for the 1998-99 tax year and for subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The effect of these changes is that disability benefit is not chargeable to tax in the case of the majority of disability benefit recipients.</P>
    <P>Even where disability benefit is chargeable to tax, that is, after the first six weeks, the extent, if any, to which taxation will actually arise in a given case will depend on the level of other income that a recipient and their spouse, where applicable have in the same tax year. If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can generally be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>

      <P>To promote lifetime transfers of land, section 112 of the Finance Act, 1994, provided for a reduction of two-thirds in the amount of stamp duty which would otherwise be chargeable on the transfer of agricultural land to a young trained farmer. This relief was introduced for a three year period and was extended for a further three years until 31 December 1999 in the Finance Act, 1997, in line with a commitment given in Partnership 2000 for inclusion, employment and competitiveness. No other sector can avail of such a generous relief.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, transfers of agricultural land between relatives attract stamp duty at half the normal rates of duty, and in such a case where the section 112 relief also applies, the rate of duty is reduced to only 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>Finally, transfers of agricultural property by way of inheritance or gift can avail of the 90 per cent capital acquisitions tax agricultural relief. In the case of a child receiving a gift or inheritance from a parent, property valued up to £1.929 million can transfer free of CAT subject to certain conditions.</P>

      <P>Stamp duty at 2 per cent is imposed on almost all non-life insurance premia. The exceptions include reinsurance, health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance. Similar levies exist in other EU countries and, in general, at rates higher than 2 per cent. The levy was introduced to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue from a source other than income tax. Consequently, at this stage, I have no plans to abolish this levy.</P>

      <i>Notes to Table 1</i>Note 1.The projections reflect:</P>
    <P>(a)the full year impact of the measures announced in the 1999 Budget;</P>
    <P>an overall net current expenditure envelope of 4% per annum for 1999 to 2001 within which expenditure will be managed;</P>
    <P>interest rates are based on core eurozone rates;</P>
    <P>exchange rates for EMU participant countries are assumed to be bilateral central rates of the ERM agreed in May last as the basis for conversion to the euro with pro-rata adjustments for other currencies;</P>
    <P>(b)under the taxation heading a technical provision for further possible changes in both 2000 and 2001 in personal taxes costing £350 million in a full year &ndash; the level of tax changes in these years will be subject to review in the light of emerging economic conditions;</P>
    <P>(c)a provision for the cost of reducing Corporation Tax rates by 4 percentage points in each of the years 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>The figures for GDP and GGB values for 1998 are the ESA 95 equivalent used for defining GDP and GGB values from 1999 on. The ESA 79 equivalent value for 1998 GDP is £60,200 million and that for the GGB is £1,172 million &ndash; a surplus of c.2% of GDP.</P>
    <P>Note 2.Appropriations-in-Aid are Departmental recipients which, with the approval of the Dáil, may be retained by a Department or Office to offset expenses instead of being paid into the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund. Details of gross voted departmental expenditures are contained in the Estimates for Public Services. PRSI receipts accrue to the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>Note 3.Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund for departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year.</P>
    <P>Note 4.A prudent contingency provision is made against factors outside the control of Government that may impact on the Budget but which cannot be foreseen at this stage. Examples are variability in tax buoyancy and exceptional costs arising in areas of public expenditure. While such variations are likely to be both positive and negative, it has been considered appropriate to allow in the projections for a modest negative net impact on the General Government Surplus and Exchequer Surplus.</P>

      <P>The EU eighth VAT Directive provides for the repayment of VAT incurred in the State in certain circumstances on purchases for their businesses by traders from outside the State such as Northern Ireland based traders who do not supply goods or services in the State. The repayment is limited to VAT on goods and services supplied to them, where such VAT would be deductible by them if they carried on a business within the State and would normally include motor fuel other than petrol.</P>
      <P>It is open to Irish VAT registered traders to avail of this directive in reclaiming VAT incurred in Northern Ireland or in any other EU member state.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in EU VAT law whereby a private individual from Northern Ireland can reclaim VAT on motor fuel purchased here.</P>

      <P>Job-sharing is one of a series of initiatives in the Civil Service designed to allow staff to match family commitments with the demands of the workplace. It would not be consistent with the aims of the job-sharing scheme if staff were permitted to take up other forms of employment whilst given time off from the Civil Service to spend additional time with their families. I draw your attention to the fact that Civil Service job sharers who expect to have less than maximum pensionable service at retirement and have been job-sharing for at least five years, or who are at least 50 years of age at the time they commence job-sharing, can, under special agreed arrangements, purchase additional years of service to augment their ultimate pension benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 and 250 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have already given details in the House of the steps I have taken to improve assessment procedures for intercountry adoption. As well as the publication of the consultancy report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo;, I have established a group to oversee the implementation of the report and allocated an additional £500,000 this year to the intercountry adoption services. The Eastern Health Board received £213,000 of this allocation on the basis of its current waiting list. Recruitment of an additional five full-time social workers, support staffing and provision of new office accommodation are included in the board's proposals for the use of the additional resources. I understand the appointments of the additional staff are likely to take place in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Under the existing legislation adoption assessments may be carried out by health boards and adoption societies registered with the Adoption Board. Any society may apply to the Adoption Board for registration under the Adoption Act 1952, section 34 to 39 (as amended) which prescribe the criteria to be met for registration. The issue of accreditation of agencies generally is being considered as part of the Department's deliberations on the ratification of the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ratification of the convention will involve <Col N="958" /> major and fundamental amendment of our intercountry adoption laws. At present, our intercountry adoption laws deal mainly with the approval of suitable prospective adopters and the recognition of foreign adoptions. One of the items which the convention Bill will have to make provision for is the accreditation of competent bodies (e.g. adoption agencies) to undertake certain tasks in relation to arrangements for the intercountry adoption of children. While the Hague Convention provides that countries may accredit such agencies, it also provides detailed criteria for the accreditation of such agencies as well as for the monitoring and policing of such agencies by a central adoption authority. Development of detailed proposals on this issue forms part of the ongoing work in my Department on proposed legislation to ratify the convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to simply focus on the number of beds available at any given time. This reflects major changes that have been taking place in medical practice, resulting in reduced average in-patient lengths of stay, a continuing shift in the delivery of care from an in-patient to day case basis and the increasing provision of treatment at out-patient level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In developing and delivering service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day case and out-patient care is a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity. As part of this process, activity in the acute hospital sector is planned over a twelve month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual <Col N="959" /> service plan, temporary bed closures would form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local management as part of their efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave, refurbishment works and the scaling down of elective activity at times of low demand such as the high summer period and at Christmas.</P>
    <P>The total discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to December 1998 was 809,099. At out-patient level, the figures show that 1,960,126 attendances were recorded in that period. This huge volume of overall activity represented an increase of 3 per cent over 1997 levels. In particular, the level of hospital care being provided on a day case basis showed a very significant increase, up over 8 per cent in 1998 over 1997 levels. The increasing delivery of care at this level reflects trends in modern medical practice and is indicative of a service that is increasingly focusing resources in a manner that is best suited to the needs of the public.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the overall range of medical and surgical services available at Waterford Regional Hospital has been greatly expanded over recent years. New regional specialities of dermatology, nephrology, rheumatology, vascular surgery and oncology have been established there and a trauma orthopaedic service has also been developed on site. These developments have been made possible by an increase of over £11 million in revenue funding for the hospital in the last three years and by the completion of major phased capital works on the site at a total cost of some £65 million. My Department is continuing to work with the South-Eastern Health Board management in identifying and addressing priorities for the ongoing development of services at the hospital in the context of available funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the services required by children with disabilities under two years of age which are provided by the acute hospital sector, a range of other services are provided, either directly by the health boards or by specialist voluntary agencies on their behalf. The principal services provided to children of this age would be early intervention services and in particular, services from the multi-disciplinary teams; the members of which would include, as appropriate, psychologists, social <Col N="960" /> workers, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I indicated in a number of previous replies about domiciliary care allowance that following receipt of a number of inquiries about the qualifying age for this allowance, I arranged for the matter to be examined. I have provided full information on the findings of this examination in replies to a recent Adjournment Debate and parliamentary questions. The outcome of the examination concluded that best international practice recognises the additional care required for children with a disability under two years of age. Very often it is not simply a matter of care but the kind and intensity of the care required. While the international experience varies in the type of and eligibility for schemes, the underlying trend is to offer some support to children under two years of age.</P>
      <P>I would like to reassure the Deputy that I support these conclusions. It is in this context that officials from my department are discussing the possibility of funding being sourced for the extension of DCA in the estimates for 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. The provision of services to children and adults with an intellectual disability and those with autism is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. There has been a substantial investment in the development of these services in recent years. Particular attention has been paid to the development of support services, including respite services, so that individuals can continue to live in the community for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>Respite care is provided in a number of ways. In some cases it is provided in a residential setting. It is also provided by host families through the various &ldquo;Share a Break&rdquo; schemes. The home support services can also provide shorter respite breaks for carers. These services enable agencies and health boards to respond to individual family's needs in a flexible manner and with a package of care which is designed in consultations with the carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional revenue funding of £12 million is being provided in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the development of new services. This additional funding is providing 80 new designated respite places in addition to the development of new residential, day and other support services for both children and adults with an intellectual disability and those with autism. The respite care services will continue to be <Col N="964" /> expanded and account has been and will continue to be taken of this need in the allocation of additional resources for the provision of new residential facilities and the enhancement of other schemes which assist families in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of children with an intellectual disability or autism require more intensive or specialist intervention on an ongoing or intermittent basis. This includes children who present with challenging behaviour. This would in the main include specialist and multi-disciplinary support on both an outreach and in-service basis, and access to planned respite breaks to assist their families. Planning for the needs of this group is included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs in their region. Of the additional revenue funding provided this year, £1.5 million has been allocated for provision of specialist and additional support services, primarily for both children and adults in this group. This funding is being allocated for specific projects in a number of health board regions. In addition, both children and adults with challenging behaviour will also benefit from the additional funding provided for increased day, residential and respite services this year.</P>
    <P>St. Paul's Hospital and special school currently provides educational, residential, respite and day services for children with autism. I understand from the Eastern Health Board that following discussions with St. Paul's, it has been agreed that a review of the services provided by them will shortly be undertaken. This review is being undertaken in the context of the overall development of services, including respite services for children with autism, in the board's region.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a total of 4,855 acute hospital beds in public hospitals in the Eastern Health Board area. Of these 4,855 beds 4,548 are in-patient beds and 307 are day beds.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative, which I published last year, recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I have provided funding in 1999 <Col N="965" /> of £3.83 million for the development of services for older people in the Eastern region which will be an important factor in helping to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used, <i>inter alia,</i> to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of chronic sick in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of identifying and securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, the Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland. It is not the policy of the Department of Health and Children or the Irish Medicines Board that all health or dietary supplements should be classified as medicinal products.</P>
      <P>The Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, which give effect to Council Directive 65/65/EEC, require that all medicinal products placed on the market must be the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board. The regulations also contain provisions for a simplified registration procedure for certain homeopathic medicines as required by Council Directive 92/73/EEC relating to homeopathic medicinal products. Before the board will grant an authorisation, it must first be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product concerned. In the case of unlicensed products, neither the safety, quality nor efficacy of such products would have been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 65/65/EEC defines a medicinal product as any substance or combination of substances for treating or preventing disease in humans or <Col N="966" /> animals or which may be administered with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions. Neither the directive nor the regulations make any distinction between conventional medicines or so-called natural health products or remedies. At the same time, however, it is accepted that there is a range of products on the market which may, depending on circumstances, be classified as either food supplements or medicinal products. For example, certain products such as vitamin or mineral supplements which may sometimes be regarded as food supplements, are sometimes presented at therapeutic dosage levels supported by specific medicinal claims. It is recognised that certain vitamins and minerals can have serious side effects if taken in excessive doses.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board recently published guidelines on the interpretation of the definition of a medicinal product as set out in the Council directive. These guidelines revise and update similar guidelines published by my Department in 1988. I am aware of concerns regarding the possible application of these guidelines. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that it is not the board's intention or desire to in any way interfere with the rights of individuals to avail of those medicines which they may wish to use. However, at the same time, it is generally accepted that, in the interest of consumer health and protection, some form of regulation of alternative medicines is desirable and, indeed, this is supported in principle by the health food and alternatives medicines industry. In this respect, the European Commission is currently considering what controls, if any, should be applied to health food products and remedies, including the possibility of providing simplified procedures for the licensing of such products.</P>

      <P>The most recent survey of nursing vacancies, carried out by the Health Service Employers Agency, related to the position at the end of <Col N="968" /> April 1999 and found that there were 566 staff nurse vacancies, all but 30 of which were in the Dublin area. I have asked the HSEA to carry out a further study of the position at 30 September 1999.</P>
      <P>On an annual basis, the approximate wages bill for such a number would be in the region of £12.6 million. However, in 1998, health agencies in the Dublin area utilised agency nurses at a cost of £13.5 million approximately. In these circumstances, taking into account agency nursing and overtime costs, it may be assumed that there is little or no overall saving accruing to the agencies.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals, and the level of vacancies fluctuate accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork has been refused dentures in spite of the fact that he is a medical card holder; and the reason he is being refused on the grounds that he is 42 years of age and should be able to provide them himself.</Quest>

      <P>As the provision of dental treatment for eligible persons in County Cork is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board I have asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to investigate the position in relation to this case and to reply to the Deputy directly as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Routine dental treatment is not yet available under the dental treatment services scheme to medical card holders in the 35-64 age group. I intend to extend routine dental treatment to this age group when the present difficulties with the Irish Dental Association regarding the operation of the scheme have been resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will understand that the scheduling of admission to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and is determined solely on the basis of medical priority and therefore, length of waiting times can vary depending on the urgency of the case concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the person referred to by the Deputy I have had inquiries made into this matter from the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, and understand that the person concerned is on that hospital's waiting list since July of this year and have been advised of an estimated date of admission. However, as I consider the estimated waiting time for admission for the person referred is considerable I have asked that this case be reviewed by the consultant concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the aim of the waiting list initiative is to reduce the in-patient waiting times in target specialties to less than 12 months for adults and less than six months for children. The target specialties are cardiac surgery, ENT, gynaecology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, plastic surgery, (general) surgery, urology and vascular surgery. This year the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital under the waiting list initiative received £447,000 to perform additional in-patient procedures. In <Col N="990" /> addition, in August the hospital received a further £300,000 incentive funding under the initiative as the hospital had achieved reductions in its waiting lists in the first quarter of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the paper delivered by Dr. Sean Barrett of the Department of Economics, Trinity College, at the Irish Hospital Consultants Association conference in Tullamore on 2 October. Many of the assertions concerning the health services made in this paper are open to challenge. In this context it must be realised that demographic trends and developments in medical technology lead to much higher cost pressures in the health area over and above that experienced in the general economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OECD, which Dr. Barrett refers to in his paper, in its review of the Irish care system in 1997 said that the system &ldquo;had resulted in good provision of health care at relatively low cost to <Col N="991" /> the taxpayer&rdquo;. The latest OECD report, 1999, states that the Irish health care system is continuing to work well.</P>
    <P>In support of this case, I wish to refer to a whole range of initiatives which have been taken recently in pursuit of cost effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware that under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, health boards are required to submit an annual service plan to my Department setting out the level of service they will deliver for the financial determination they have received. The service planning discipline and structures now in place in health agencies such as the Southern Health Board and the continuing developments in this area will lead to enhanced cost effectiveness throughout the system.</P>
    <P>A Healthcare Materials Management Board has been set up to guide best practice in the materials management area across the whole of the health sector to ensure that value for money is being achieved in each agency and through the combined purchasing power of all the health agencies.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing development of information communications technology aimed at enhancing the delivery and cost effectiveness through integrated care processes. These developments are contributing to the efficiency of service provision and the provision of better management information to assist in the pursuit of further cost effectiveness. The Southern Health Board has invested heavily in implementing modern information systems and is continuing to receive support from my Department to further support the delivery of health care services.</P>
    <P>In the area of acute hospital services my Department has operated a system of costed casemix budgeting which ensures that cost effectiveness considerations are taken into account in determining hospital budgets. On the basis of casemix criteria, the Southern Health Board performs well and Cork University Hospital in particular has consistently been shown to operate in a cost effective manner.</P>
    <P>The continued increases in activity demonstrate the system's ability to respond to the increasing demands placed upon it effectively. With regard to in-patient and day case activity, the total discharges nationally, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to December 1998 were 809,099. This huge volume of overall activity represented an increase of 3 per cent over 1997 levels. In particular, the level of hospital care being provided on a day case basis showed a very significant increase, up over 8 per cent in 1998 over 1997 levels. These activity trends are generally reflected by the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>This upward trend in overall activity is continuing in the first six months of 1999 and the increases in the delivery of services, including the increased proportion of day cases, clearly indicate <Col N="992" /> the increasing cost effectiveness in the delivery of health care services.</P>

      <P>Adult cardiac bypass surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital and since September 1998, St. James's Hospital, Dublin. There are a total of nine cardiac surgeons, including two in Cork University Hospital, involved in carrying out cardiac bypass surgery in these hospitals. By the end of September 1999, 886 bypass operations had been carried out since 1 January 1999. The breakdown by hospital is as follows, St. James's Hospital, 16; Mater Misericordiae Hospital, 557; and Cork University, Hospital 313.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis. At the end of June 1999, the most recent period for which information is available, there were a total of 763 adults awaiting cardiac surgery over 12 months and 259 waiting for three to 12 months. There were a total of 66 children awaiting cardiac surgery over six months, and 18 waiting for three to six months.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in 1998, I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The cardiac surgery waiting list initiative has a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list. The total number of public patients awaiting cardiac surgery has reduced from 1,619 in September 1997 to 1,106 in June 1999, this represents a reduction of 32 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac <Col N="993" /> surgery capacity by over 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the National Cardiac Unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out on the following tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Table 1 contains details of all hip replacements carried out in public hospitals during 1998, including those for patients on waiting lists. Table 2 shows the total number of consultant ortho<Col N="994" /> paedic surgeons by hospital, including locums, on 31 December 1998.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the waiting list figures at the end of June 1999 show a reduction of 1,072 on the March figures. This means that waiting lists have fallen by almost 3,000, some 8 per cent, since the beginning of this year. The reductions in March and June 1999 are the first since December 1996. The total number of patients awaiting orthopaedic procedures, including hip replacements, was 5,862 on 30 June 1999, representing a reduction of 786 or 11.8 per cent since June 1998.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root cause of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies who achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Government policy in drug misuse is that a wide range of treatment options should be provided, including methadone treatment, detoxification and other programmes aimed at those addicted to drugs, especially people who are addicted to heroin. Methadone maintenance is internationally recognised as a valid and successful part of an integrated response to the drug problem. It has also been shown that it is possible to reduce the antisocial behaviour of intravenous drug users by taking them into treatment on methadone maintenance programmes.</P>
      <P>The 1998 report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction on &ldquo;The State of the Drugs Problem in the European Union&rdquo; noted that substitution treatment is the most evaluated field of drug demand reduction, with generally positive results including increases in employment, improvement in emotional status, physical appearance, health, family and social relations, finances and vocational skills, with reduction in criminality, debts and heroin use. Generally also, HIV patients comply with monitoring and treatment. In all member states in 1997 a total of 265,664 people were on substitution treatment, mainly methadone. The value of such programmes is that they can stabilise the often chaotic lifestyles of drug misusers and thus begin to influence their behaviour. This in turn can have major benefits for the drug misuser's health and welfare and also for their families, friends and society in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general aim of all of our drug treatment programmes is to allow drug misusers to free themselves of the scourge of addiction so that they can go on to play a full and active part in society. In this regard the provision of methadone <Col N="997" /> maintenance must not be seen as a panacea which will solve the problem. We must also have in place a range of counselling and support services which will support drug misusers in their efforts to deal with their addiction. The provision of rehabilitation programmes is a vital element in this support and in this context the Eastern Health Board is urgently developing a rehabilitation policy, the aim of which will be to offer an individually tailored programme to each drug misuser presenting for treatment. The implementation of these programmes will, I am confident, result in a positive outcome for a significant number of drug misusers in treatment.</P>

      <Quest>the disciplinary proceeding, if any, by the Medical Council, or other body, taken or proposed to be taken against the doctor involved in the case of baby A and an agency (details supplied) where the High Court found that the mother of the infant identified was one of around 50 girls with crisis pregnancies referred by the agency to the same general practitioner.</Quest>

      <P>The Medical Council was established to provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978. This Act provides that the Medical Council, or any person, may apply to the Fitness to Practise Committee for an inquiry into a named registered medical practitioner and if such an application is received the committee is required to decide if there are sufficient grounds for the holding of a sworn inquiry.</P>
      <P>The provisions of Part V of the Act are such as to preclude the Medical Council or the Fitness to Practise Committee from making public any matter concerning a registered medical practitioner that is being addressed. The legislation provides that where a practitioner has been found guilty of professional misconduct and/or unfit to practice following a sworn inquiry, it is open to the Medical Council to make such a finding public and it is the usual practice of the Council to do so when all proceedings have been completed. Where no finding has been made of professional misconduct and-or unfitness, the matter may only be made public with the consent of the practitioner.</P>
      <P>With regard to taking disciplinary proceedings in the case of the agency involved, as I stated last month in the House, there is no legislation governing the provision of counselling services and those employed as counsellors are subject only to regulatory regimes and guidelines operated by their respective professional bodies. The Department is currently examining whether counselling services should be regulated and, if so, what form such regulation might take.</P>
      <P>I have been in contact with the Garda Síochána with a view to establishing if they intend pursuing a criminal investigation in this matter and I am currently awaiting a reply. I have also referred the matter to the Adoption Board for consideration. I will communicate further with Deputy McManus on this issue in due course.</P>

      <Quest>if the implementation of consistent standards of practice in the care of cardiovascular disease, between and within health board regions, is being undertaken as recommended by the national cardiovascular health strategy report published in July 1999; if emer gency response call times for ambulances are being recorded in all health board areas in view of the importance to survival of timely response; if a simple command and control centre for emergency ambulances is being established in each health board area; and if general practitioners will in future be paid to undertake preventative care of general medical services patients at risk of cardiovascular disease in the same way in which they are paid to treat patients with the disease.</Quest>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the implementation of the 211 recommendations of the Cardiovascular Health Strategy &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts. A major national conference will take place on 5 November where the recommendations contained in the report will be discussed in detail with all of the organisations involved in its planned implementation.</P>
      <P>A programme of investment in the ambulance service has been under way since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance services in 1993. Approximately £23 million in additional funding has been provided for the implementation of the report's recommendations. The development of more explicit standards for performance measurement is a key element of the implementation of the health strategy in the ambulance service. In this regard, funding has been provided to each health board in 1998 and 1999 for the development of ambulance response times and quality of care monitoring.</P>
      <P>As a first step towards routine response times monitoring, I have asked each of the health boards to ensure that response times data for emergency and urgent calls be collected and analysed on a quarterly sample basis. The Deputy should, however, be aware that while response times are an important indicator of performance for ambulance services, it is also important to focus on quality of care and clinical effectiveness. In this regard, a standard patient report form has been introduced to facilitate the development of clinical audit in pre-hospital care. In addition, appropriate clinical care standards underpin that the developments currently taking place are at an advanced stage of development and will be brought into use later this year.</P>
      <P>Regional command and control centres are operational in four health board areas and a joint fire and ambulance control centre for the Dublin areas has recently been commissioned. Construction and equipping of regional command and control centres is at an advanced stage in the remaining health boards.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the further development of the pre-hospital service in line with the cardiovascular health strategy and will be providing further support to build on the progress to date in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of general practitioners involve<Col N="1000" /> ment in, and payment for, preventative medicine, including cardiovascular disease, under the General medical services scheme is an issue which is being examined by my Department in consultation with the health boards in the light of this and other preventative initiatives which will be coming on stream in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy requested information in relation to the number of hours care in total provided to each person requiring care each week. It is not possible to furnish these particular statistics for the following reasons: the very large number of individuals covered by the above mentioned services; the input in individual cases can range from two to three hours a week to 105 hours in the case of personal assistants; and the number of hours can change in individual cases from week to week because of personal circumstances.</P>
      <P>I have therefore asked the health boards to indicate the average number of hours service per client.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the increasing costs of drugs for cancer treatments and my Department is monitoring the situation closely. Agencies have been asked to keep my Department informed of the extent of any increased costs being experienced under this heading and to give full details of where these are arising.</P>
      <P>To date I have made additional funding available during 1999 in respect of the drug costs relating to certain new posts in consultant medical oncology. I will examine the need for further extra funding for agencies in this regard in the context of the Estimates process for 2000 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the actions taken to help reduce the death rate from cancer, it is too early to make informed judgments about the progress so far. It is important to note that, because of the nature of the disease, the many initiatives taken under the National Cancer Strategy will have the greatest effect on the death rate from cancer in the medium to long-term, as treatment services improve, screening-early detection programmes commence and health promotion measures are further developed.</P>
      <P>The third report of the National Cancer Registry Board, which collects data on the incidence and mortality rates from cancer, was published yesterday, 18 October 1999. The data in this report relate to 1996, and I understand from the registry that good progress has been made in relation to collecting and analysing data for 1997 and 1998. The registry's earliest detailed national figures on cancer are in respect of 1994. The registry expects to be in a position to publish five-year survival data next year. This will give a clear indication of the trends over time in cancer deaths. However, I would again emphasise that the effects of our initiatives under the National Cancer Strategy will best be judged over a longer time period.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be interested to hear about the progress on the establishment of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery. The Commission on Nursing recommended that this new council be established on a statutory basis with responsibility for post-registration professional development of nursing and midwifery, while An Bord Altranais would concentrate on pre-registration education. The council is in the process of being established. The council will have a central role in monitoring the ongoing development of specialist nursing posts and in determining the appropriate level of qualification and experience for entry to such posts.</P>

      <P>The provision of treatment in the case referred to by the Deputy is the responsibility, in the first instance, of St. James's Hospital. I have, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of this hospital to investigate the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>With regard to problems in accident and emergency departments generally, the levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and in this regard all accident and emergency departments experience periods of exceptional demand which can result in delays for patients. However, it is important to note that appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times and that waiting periods are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, I made an additional £2.3 million avail<Col N="1003" /> able for the development of accident and emergency services. This additional funding was used to fund a national public education campaign aimed at persuading people with minor ailments to attend their family doctor rather than a hospital accident and emergency department, and also the development of a range of initiatives in major accident and emergency departments. Within this funding, St. James's Hospital received an allocation of £200,000, this funding was deployed for the provision of additional accident and emergency staff in order to alleviate pressures in the accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>This year I provided further funding of £2 million to enable major acute hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing some of the difficulties being experienced in our accident and emergency departments particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives will include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    <P>As part of this overall funding, a sum of £210,000 was allocated to St. James's Hospital for the continued development of a rapid diagnostic system for patients and the creation of a patient discharge waiting area-lounge for patients awaiting transport home, thereby realising inpatient beds at the early opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have also published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and am committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented. The report is one of a number of measures which I have taken to address the question of long waiting lists and waiting times. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999. This is a 66 per cent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997. The report recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>In an effort to address these problems, I have provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds which are currently <Col N="1004" /> occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used, <i>inter alia,</i> to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards. There are also a number of chronic sick in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months. I am confident that the measures I have outlined will contribute to improvements in availability of beds in the acute sector and ease pressures in accident and emergency departments in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Estimate process has not yet concluded and I am not in a position to inform the Deputy as to the detail of increased funding to hospital services for next year.</P>

      <P>The pilot CAREDOC scheme, which is designed to provide a structured out of hours general practitioner service in County Carlow and surrounding areas, involves 26 general practitioners, and is being closely evaluated on an ongoing basis from the patient, health board and general practitioner perspectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far 5,755 people have used the service which commenced on 8 June of this year. Question<Col N="1005" /> naires are forwarded on a random basis to every tenth CAREDOC patient user and based on replies received there is a 99 per cent satisfaction rating. The average response times for the CAREDOC service, to date, are as follows: less than 1 hour, 80 per cent; less than 1.5 hours, 9 per cent; less than 2 hours, 5 per cent; Over 2 hours, 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The majority of calls in the 2 hour category are based on an appointment basis, where arrangements have been made for the doctor to see patients at their local health centre.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is, at the moment, some public concern regarding the CAREDOC scheme following the publication of misleading anecdotal information. However, on the basis of investigation of same by the South-Eastern Health Board and based on the evidence currently available, I am satisfied that CAREDOC is providing a quality out of hours service. I would add that since the scheme is a pilot one my Department and the SEHB will continue to monitor it closely to enable a full evaluation of its operation.</P>
    <P>Further, if the Deputy is aware of any individual who is unhappy with the service received, it would be extremely useful to have details outlining the nature of the problem encountered. Any complaints or criticisms of the service will be dealt with in a totally confidential manner.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations, 1998, which I made earlier this year have removed the provision which allowed health boards to assess the capacity of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent. The change is effective from 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>The health boards have been instructed to review the position of all those in receipt of a reduced rate of subvention by virtue of the capacity of a son and-or daughter to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care and any change in the rate of subvention payable will be back dated to 1 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allow for the assessment of the income of a married person in respect of whom a subvention has been sought as half the combined income and imputed income of the couple. In assessing the income of an applicant for a subvention, the health board may take into account the value of the following: house property, excluding normal household chattels; stocks, shares; money on <Col N="1006" /> hand, in trust, lodged, deposited or invested; interests in a company or business of any kind, including a farm;interest in land; life assurance or endowment policies; valuables held as investments and current value of equipment of a business or machinery, excluding a car, not covered above.</P>
    <P>Further to house property, the value of the principal residence of the couple must be disregarded if it is occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than twenty one years or under or in full-time education, or by a relative in receipt of named benefits from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. It should also be noted that if an applicant for a subvention has transferred the ownership of a farm in the five years prior to applying, the health board may take into account any payment on transfer and-or any continuing income from the earnings of the farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning for the provision of car parking in towns is a matter for each planning authority in the context of its development plan. My Department has not issued guidelines to local authorities in this matter.</P>
      <P>Under section 344 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 tax incentives were made available for the development of multi-storey car parks in certain urban areas, to support policies of urban renewal and to support commercial and business life in the core areas of urban centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developers wishing to avail of the tax incentives had to satisfy the relevant local authority that the development meets certain criteria. It <Col N="1011" /> must support the objective of making the core area of the urban centre the focus for the centre's commercial and business activity; the planning and design of the multi-storey car park must take account of the nature and character of the area; it must support the relevant local authority's traffic and parking management policies; and the multi-storey car park must be open to the public generally and the level and structure of parking charges and hours of operation must operate so as to encourage the use of the car park for short stay parking rather than long stay parking.</P>
    <P>These tax incentives were due to expire on 30 June 1998, but this time limit has, subject to certain conditions, been extended to 31 December 2000. To qualify for this extension, developers were required to demonstrate to the relevant local authority that they had incurred 15 per cent of the costs of the particular project by 30 September 1999.</P>
    <P>An integrated area plan for Drogheda was submitted by Louth County Council in relation to the 1999 urban renewal scheme. In that plan a case was made for applying tax incentives for the provision of a multi-storey car park in Dyer Street. On the recommendation of the expert advisory panel on urban renewal, this area was approved for such incentives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of park and ride facilities, through the use of out-of-town car parks or otherwise, is widely recognised as a useful instrument of urban transport management. Well located park and ride facilities can assist in encouraging commuters to leave their cars in secure parking areas and travel by public transport to city centres, thereby reducing traffic congestion.</P>
      <P>The main actions taken to date by this Government to promote the development by local authorities, transport providers and the private sector of park and ride facilities are the provision of £2 million in the 1999 budget for the development of such facilities in the Dublin area &ndash; this funding is currently being used for the development of new and the upgrading of existing, mainly rail based, park and ride facilities; and the inclusion of a tax incentive regime in the Finance Act, 1999 aimed at encouraging the participation of the private sector in the development of park and ride facilities to serve the cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I issued guidelines in August 1999 on the criteria and requirements to be met by park and ride facilities and associated residential development for which tax relief is sought. Further guidelines will be issued in due course relating to tax incentives for associated commercial development <Col N="1012" /> when the necessary EU approval for such incentives has been obtained.</P>

      <P>Full access to bus lanes is at present permitted only to buses and large public service vehicles. Pedal cycles and taxis may use &ldquo;with flow&rdquo; bus lanes.</P>
      <P>Hackneys, as private hire vehicles, have not been permitted to use bus lanes in view of their more limited service role, which does not involve publicly standing or plying for hire, and the practical difficulty of distinguishing them from private cars. The Dublin taxi forum, while recommending some form of external identification for hackneys to facilitate enforcement of regulations by the Garda Síochána, nonetheless, recommended against the merging of the separate service roles of taxis and hackneys, against roof signage for hackneys and against permitting access to bus lanes by hackneys. I have no proposals to extend the use of bus lanes to hackneys at this time.</P>
      <P>However, the recently made Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1999, provide for a range of improvements to the regulatory framework for taxis and hackneys, following closely the advice of the Dublin taxi forum and discussions with the various interests concerned. In relation to hackneys, the regulations make new provisions for limited external identification of vehicles, the use of two-way radios and telephonic equipment and the carrying of a log of agreed fares.</P>

My Department again wrote to local authority managers in July 1998 asking that they consider the adequacy of their professional/technical and administrative/clerical staffing in order to ensure that the planning system does not cause <Col N="1013" /> bottlenecks in meeting demand and delivers the best possible service to the customer. My Department has approved all requests for additional professional planners.</P>
      <P>My Department does not provide specific grants to local authorities in respect of the employment of staff. Local authority income to meet such costs would, in the main, comprise income from rates, fees and charges for goods and services and general purpose grants.

      <P>I introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons' grants scheme in December last. The effective maximum grant payable under the scheme was increased by 50 per cent from £8,000 to £12,000 in the case of works commenced on or after 2 December 1998. In addition, the maximum grant payable in respect of private houses was increased to three-quarters of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds previously. The maximum recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities in respect of each grant was also increased to two thirds or £8,000 compared to a maximum recoupment of 50 per cent or £4,000 previously. This increase in the recoupment rate allowed local authorities to pay the higher grants now available at no increased cost to the authority.</P>

      <P>A total of £465,000 and £565,000 for the operation of the scheme of special housing aid for the elderly within its area was allocated in 1998 and 1999, respectively, to the North-Western Health Board by the task force which administers the scheme under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the most recent returns furnished by the North-Western Health Board, a total of 173 applications were on hands at 30 June 1999, of which 140 were in County Donegal. The waiting time for applicants would depend on a number of factors, including the resources available for the scheme and the relative urgency of individual cases. Detailed information in relation to the operation of the scheme is not available in my Department, as the scheme is operated at local level by the health board, from whom information on the position relating to any individual case may be obtained.</P>

      <P>On 22 October 1998 local authorities were asked by my Department to undertake a formal assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas under the water services investment programme and to prepare prioritised lists of projects for the periods 2000 to 2006 and 2007 to 2020 based on the assessment. Dublin Corporations' estimate of their investment requirements for these periods is £214 million and £299 million respectively. The assessment will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water service investment programmes under the forthcoming national development plan. The investment programme for 2000 has not yet been decided.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 water supply projects worth £113 million submitted by the Dublin authorities have been approved by my Department. Expenditure on such projects during the same period has amounted to £42 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises that women who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home face difficulties in maintaining their social insurance record and has given a commitment under An Action Programme for the Millennium &ldquo;to provide the mechanism to allow women, who take time out for family reasons, to continue contributions for pension purposes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain measures have already been introduced to address this issue. Special arrangements are in place to help people who work in the home <Col N="1017" /> to qualify for an old age, contributory, pension. From 6 April 1994 years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six, increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995, or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions for old age, contributory, pension purposes. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded in this way.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker. In addition, earnings of up to £30 per week where a person is engaged in part-time employment outside the home are also permitted. It is estimated that up to 250,000 people could ultimately benefit under the above arrangements.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that in November 1997 I introduced new <i>pro rata </i>pensions so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age, contributory, pension. A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent. To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions. This measure is of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after a child, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    <P>In line with its stated commitment, the Government accepts that more work needs to be done in this area. My Department is now considering the issue on a threefold basis.</P>
    <P>First, the issue is being examined in the context of the general review of the qualifying conditions for the old age, contributory, and retirement pensions which, it is hoped, will be completed shortly. This review will consider the present disregard arrangements and alternatives such as the award of credited contributions and the question of retrospection. Second, an in-depth examination by the Department of the general provisions of the homemakers scheme will also get under way later this year.</P>
    <P>However, I should point out that any change to the present arrangements &ndash; particularly in the area of retrospection &ndash; would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.</P>
    <P>Finally, the issue of supplementary pension provision, is being considered by the Department in the context of the pensions board report on the national pensions policy initiative, NPPI. In their report &ndash;&ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;&ndash; the Pensions Board recommended that occupational pension coverage targets also include specific targets for increased coverage of women in both employed and self-employed areas.</P>
    <P>The board considered that the proposed introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, would greatly facilitate the position of women with broken employment records due to childcare and other responsibilities. The working <Col N="1018" /> group, chaired by my Department, which was set up to examine issues relating to the introduction of PRSAs, is making good progress. The outcome of the group's deliberations will be reflected in the comprehensive pensions Bill which I will publish next year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance for a number of years based on a &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; means assessment.</P>
      <P>A review of his means was carried out in February 1998. During the course of this review it came to light that he had been self-employed since 1991.</P>
      <P>Efforts to interview the person concerned failed and his claim was forwarded to a deciding officer for decision. On 24 March 1998 his claim was disallowed on the grounds that his means could not be determined.</P>
      <P>This decision was appealed to the independent social welfare appeals office. The appeals officer formed the view that the person concerned was engaged in self-employment from 1991 to 1998 and that he knowingly failed to inform the Department of his earnings in that period.</P>

    <P>

      <P>Disablement pension is paid where a person has sustained a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an occupational accident. The amount of payment depends on the degree of disablement which is medically assessed.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the person has been assessed as being 70 per cent disabled. Accordingly, the disablement pension is paid at the rate of 70 per cent of the maximum rate &ndash; currently £68 a week.</P>
      <P>The annual budget increases in reduced rate disablement pensions, as in the case of all other reduced rate contributory payments, is determined by reference to the percentage relationship between the reduced rate and the appropriate maximum rate of payment.</P>
      <P>The disablement pension scheme differs from other weekly social welfare payments in that it is not regarded as a payment to replace lost income, but rather, a compensatory payment. Disablement pension can therefore, be paid in addition to any other social welfare payment which the person may qualify for, for example, disability benefit or invalidity pension. Furthermore, disablement pension is also paid where the person is working.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, the person is also entitled to invalidity pension at the weekly rate of £75.20 in addition to his disablement pension. The invalidity pension attracted the full budget increase of £3 per week. Accordingly, the person in question received a combined budget increase of £5.10 last June, bringing his total weekly social welfare income to £143.20.</P>
      <P>The question of future increases in invalidity and disablement pensions are matters to be decided in budgetary context having regard to the available resources and in the light of the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to substantially increasing social welfare payments and, specifically, to increasing the old age pension to £100 a week by the year 2002. Significant progress has already been made in this regard. In the two budgets since taking office, the Government has moved half way towards achieving the £100 target rate by increasing the personal rates of old age contributory and retirement pensions by £11 to £89 per week. Invalidity pensioners aged 65 and over have also received similar increases.</P>
      <P>The rates of payment for social welfare recipients under pension age, including invalidity pensioners aged under 65 years, have been increased by £6 per week over the same period. These increases now mean that the weekly rates of invalidity pension range between 105 per cent and 124 per cent of the Commission on Social Welfare's recommended target rate.</P>

      <P>Widow/ers and single parents are provided for under the social welfare system through three schemes, the widow/er's contributory pension, the widow/er's non-contributory pension and the one-parent family payment, OFP.</P>
      <P>The widow/er's contributory pension is available to all widows and widowers who can satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions based on their own or their late spouse's contribution record.</P>
      <P>The pension is not means tested and is not affected by other income such as earnings which a widow/er might have. The pension will continue in payment as long as the person does not remarry or cohabit. Widow/ers who do not qualify for a contributory pension may, depending on means and whether or not they have dependent children, receive either a widow/er's non contributory pension or a one-parent family payment, OFP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OFP is intended as a support for people who are bringing up children or their own and treats all categories of lone parent whether they are widowed, separated or unmarried in the same way. The main difference between the OFP and the widow's non-contributory pension relates to the means test which allows an OFP recipient to earn up to £115.38 per week without affecting his/her payment with only 50 per cent of earnings <Col N="1023" /> from that level to £230.76 per week being counted as means. The more generous means test applying to the OFP is linked to the presence of dependent children and is designed to recognise the particular problems and expenses faced by those bringing up children on their own and to encourage them to consider employment as an alternative to long-term welfare dependency. Rules in relation to marriage and cohabitation, which apply to widow/er's pensions, also apply to the OFP. However, payment of an OFP also ceases when the person no longer has dependent children. Widow/ers who are former OFP recipients can then claim the widow/er's non contributory pension while others may apply for schemes such as unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance etc.</P>
    <P>The OFP is currently being reviewed under the Department's expenditure review programme and this will, amongst other things, include an examination of the means test, the success of the current arrangements, which were introduced in 1997, in encouraging single parents to take up employment and the position of lone parents vis a vis other welfare recipients. It is expected that the review will be completed early next year.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has examined Carlow Castle and report that while its existing fabric is generally sound, minor works will be undertaken in the near future to help prevent further deterioration of the building.</P>
      <P>As part of Dúchas's on-going programme of conservation and in consultation with the local authorities, it is proposed to undertake a programme of works which will make the site safe and accessible to the public. These works will include: landscaping; provision of interpretative panels and the provision of footpaths. Drawings of the proposed landscaping works will be on display in the offices of Carlow County Council in the near future and the work is scheduled to be carried out in 2000.</P>
      <P>The castle is not suitable for restoration as over two thirds of its original structure is no longer in existence.</P>

      <P>While there are no plans at present to restore this building a full programme of conservation works is planned. These works will comprise masonry cleaning, repointing and the repair and conservation of carved stonework. The visitor access from the street will be improved and information panels will be provided.</P>
      <P>However due to a current shortage of suitably qualified staff in Waterford city, implementation of this programme has been delayed. Interviews to recruit suitable persons will take place shortly.</P>
      <P>Essential conservation work to the windows was carried out earlier this year and further conservation and presentation works are scheduled to be carried out in 2000.</P>

      <P>The director general of the <Col N="1030" /> prison service has informed me that teachers employed by local vocational education committees form the major part of the prison education service. Currently, the total allocation from the Department of Education and Science to VEC's for prison education amounts to 178.21 teachers measured as wholetime equvalents. This allows for the employment of about 220 individual teachers, who are engaged either wholetime or part-time basis. Salary payments to these teachers are a mater for the appropriate VEC.</P>
      <P>The director general has further informed me that 37 teachers are designated as teaching literacy or basic education. However many other prison teachers also provide help with literacy difficulties, often integrating this effort with their teaching of some other subject.</P>
      <P>Prison education has grown greatly in recent decades, achieving a substantial presence in all prisons and engaging more than half of all prisoners voluntarily in classes. One of the objectives of the prison education service is &ldquo;to give special attention to offenders with basic education needs&rdquo;. This prioritisation is also reflected by Department's strategy statement for 1998-2000. The director general of the prison service has assured me that the basic education needs of prisoners will continue to be given priority attention.</P>

      <P>The Government has recently approved my proposals for an Intoxicating Liquor (No. 2) Bill. The proposals in that Bill are wide-ranging. They cover hours of trading, licensing and offences for breaches of licensing laws, including those in relation to under-age drinking. The proposals take into account the recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee on Liquor Licensing, the Competition Authority, and submissions which my Department received from the public and relevant interest groups in relation to those recommendations. In so far as supermarkets are concerned there are no proposals for change that are specific to them but the proposals in general, as they affect retail outlets, will affect their licensing hours, their licensing and the sanctions which apply for breaches of the licensing laws.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy during the Adjournment Debate in question and in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 485 on 20 April 1999, an inquiry into how the person in question did not receive the original notification of the court decision established that this was due to administrative error. In response to that debate, my Department on my instructions, asked the chief registrar of the High Court to urgently review the procedures followed by the court office when notifying prisoners of the outcome of <i>habeas corpus</i> applications. I also brought this matter to the attention of the chief executive designate of the new courts service. Moreover, I directed my officials to inquire into the matter and on foot of that inquiry the court office in question issued copies of the judges rulings to the prison on 13 April 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the normal procedure when such documents issue to a prison, they are accompanied by a covering letter from the court office to the applicant indicating the ruling of the court. On receipt of the documents and covering letter the prison authorities would make these available to the applicant and record that fact. Given the circumstances surrounding this case and in an effort to issue the documents to the <Col N="1032" /> prison as speedily as possible, it appears that this covering letter was overlooked and did not issue. While the court documents were placed on the applicant's prison file, I am informed by the prison authorities that there is no indication on that file that he was given access to same.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously these administrative errors should not have occurred and this is a matter of very serious concern to me.</P>
    <P>In previous answers in relation to this case I indicated that procedures in the court office were to be reviewed. I have again brought this matter to the attention of the chief executive officer designate of the courts service and asked him to examine the issues arising as a matter of urgency so as to ensure such errors are not repeated in future and to draw up a written procedure for dealing with court applications of this nature. I have also today asked the director general of the prison service and the chief executive officer designate of the courts service to meet urgently to identify and put in place measures in both these agencies to prevent a recurrence of errors of this nature.</P>
    <P>Regrettably I understand that up to recently the person involved had not received a copy of the court documents in question. I understand that the person in question has since completed his sentence. When this again was brought to my notice I directed that copies of the relevant documentation should be sent to his last known address and this was done yesterday, 18 October 1999.</P>

More recently, Donegal County Council has been asked to look for a suitable site in the area for a small purpose built courthouse.</P>
      <P>As soon as those consultations have been concluded and all the necessary information is available a final decision will be taken on this matter.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 756 of 29 September 1999 and 86 of 12 October 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will, no doubt, be aware, arising out of the buoyancy in the economy and the current high level of activity in the housing market the number of dealings being lodged with, and the level of business being transacted by, the Land Registry has been increasing steadily for some years now and has been subject to unprecedented increases in recent years.</P>
      <P>In this light I am pleased to be able to report that significant efficiencies have been generated by the registries. For example, overall output of applications for registration has increased by 20 per cent. This is a significant achievement and I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds for their efforts in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated that my Department has written to the Department of Finance making a <Col N="1035" /> strong case for the allocation of additional staff to deal with the increase in the level of business in the Land Registry.

      <P>Work on the draft Disabilities Bill has been included in the legislative programme of my Department and preliminary work on the proposed format of the Bill has commenced. I consider it most important that a considered approach is taken in the preparation of the proposed Disabilities Bill as the issues involved are complex and will require innovative and progressive thought. As a result, I expect it will be some time before final proposals for the format of the Bill will be available. It is intended that this legislation will be developed in the context of the legislative framework which has been put in place under this Government, including the Employment Equality Act, 1998, the National Disability Authority Act, 1999, and the Equal Status Bill, 1999, which is expected to be enacted later this year. The Equality Authority and Office of Equality Investigations became operational earlier this week. The National Disability Authority is expected to become operational early next year and will play a key role in empowering people with disabilities to achieve their full economic, social and political rights.</P>

As I informed the Deputy in response to Question No. 57 of 12 October, while two recommendations in the report were of sufficient urgency to warrant action at an early stage and lead to the decision which I have referred, the report states <Col N="1038" /> that a period of three months after publication should be allowed for responses to it from interested parties. Following such consultations an outline implementation plan should be produced within a further three months. In keeping with this recommendation, I invited interested parties to send their comments on the report to my Department by 5 November. At that stage I will bring proposals to Government regarding implementation of recommendations. This will take full account of the views expressed in the responses to the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the letter referred to by the Deputy, the Union of Students in Ireland calls for a number of specific measures to be taken for third level students. These measures form part of the USI's 1999 pre-budget submission. I have previously outlined my response to the overall pre-budget submission and I have today issued a reply to USI's letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the basic premise that investment in education has led to our current prosperity and that education is the key to maintaining that prosperity. In 1999, this Government will invest over £2.8 billion on education, of which some £680 million is in respect of third level education, when capital and current investment is taken into account. This represents a major advance on previous funding levels. Furthermore, this Government has made unprecedented investment in third level education by way of the public-private partnership fund for advanced research and the education technology <Col N="1040" /> investment fund which will develop education at all levels.</P>
    <P>Specifically at third level, this Government has funded a major increase in the number of places in public colleges and that, as I have said previously, continues to be the clear priority. Third level enrolments this year will be in the region of 112,000 students as compared with an enrolment of under 100,000 in 1996. Earlier this year I announced a major £75 million investment plan targeted at skills areas, where there is a high level of employment growth. This investment will provide an additional 5,400 places, predominantly in the engineering and computer hardware and software areas. The Government is determined that Ireland will maintain its place at the forefront of technological developments worldwide, and investment in education is the key to this. This £75 million investment plan is just the latest in a range of unprecedented investment programmes at all levels of the education system. The largest building programme in the history of Irish education is currently under way and at third level this is transforming campuses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have indicated previously, in relation to the student support schemes, that my priority is to remove anomalies in the schemes. In particular, I have honoured the commitment in the programme for Government An Action Programme for the Millennium, to the introduction of equitable support for students attending post-leaving certificate courses. A maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses was introduced with effect from the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
    <P>I have also addressed the position of mature students in general and independent mature students in particular, under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which she or he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant. With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students will qualify for the higher non-adjacent <Col N="1041" /> rate of maintenance grant at an estimated cost of £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>
    <P>On the specific question of disadvantaged access, the third level colleges have developed initiatives to tackle the problem of access for the disadvantaged to third level education, through targeted funding provided to the universities by the higher education authority and funding from within the overall financial allocations to the institutes of technology. These initiatives involve links with second level schools and local communities. I have announced a specific allocation of £3 million over two years to promote access to third level among students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. My Department has had discussions with the access officers of the colleges, the Union of Students in Ireland, the Higher Education Authority and other interested bodies in relation to this funding and I hope to be in a position to finalise the arrangements for the funding in the near future. I have also provided a further £1.5 million over two years to address the issue of non-completion of courses and my Department is engaged in discussions with institutes of technology with regard to the measures for which this funding will be used.</P>
    <P>On the issue of student accommodation, the Government has already introduced special tax incentives to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>I would point out that I have, on a number of occasions over the last two years, met with USI to discuss the full range of issues of concern to them. I remain of the opinion that many of the specific proposals which they are promoting would do little or nothing to broaden access or improve the quality of third level education. In addition, to agree to the full range of proposals would involve a reduction in the allocations to primary and second level education, and the Government has made it clear that it will not adopt the policy of its predecessor of allowing school funding to suffer because of the prioritisation of third level. This said, we have very significantly expanded funding for third level over the past two years, by 19 per cent <i>versus </i>the 1997 allocation, and will continue to ensure that we invest in expanding access and improving facilities.</P>

      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services. The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case. In some cases, children with mild cases of autism are educated in ordinary schools, with the support, where necessary, of remedial and resource teachers.</P>
      <P>Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools, including schools for children with mild general learning disability and schools for children with emotional-behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the last school year I announced the formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism. Such children are now being catered for in 48 special classes established in special schools and in mainstream primary schools throughout the country. Each class, which caters for a maximum of six pupils, receives the support of a class teacher, a special needs assistant and enhanced capitation funding. In addition, the relevant health authority provides an outreach support service.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently investigating the possibility of establishing additional special classes for children with autism in a variety of locations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to continue to target such educational supports for children with autism where an assessed level of need has been identified.</P>

      <P>The current position in relation to the length of the school year and other related issues was outlined to schools by circular in 1995. School authorities are obliged to ensure that schools adhere to the prescribed minimum number of teaching days per annum. At primary level the minimum number of teaching days per school year is 183, while at second level, schools are required to be open for teaching for 167 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, the minimum number of <Col N="1044" /> instruction hours per week is 28, six per day or three in a half day. A full school day at primary comprises a period of not less than five hours and forty minutes. Any day on which the pupils complete two hours and 50 minutes but less than five hours and forty minutes is regarded as a half school day.</P>
    <P>Subject to the requirement in the primary sector that the schools must close for the months of July and August, the organisation and structure of the school year are matters for individual boards of management or vocational education committees, which are charged with the direct governance of schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 343 and 344 together.</P>
      <P>The adult education section in my Department was established in 1980. Its remit was to deal with all aspects of adult education including adult literacy. In 1998, the programme delivery element of certain ESF-aided programmes outside the third level sector, and the work of the adult education section were integrated for the first time into a further education section. The new section deals with vocational training and adult education policy, including the consultation and development of a White Paper on Adult Education, inputs to the National Development Plan, etc., allied with all funding, co-ordination and policy matters concerning programmes for early school leavers &ndash; Youthreach and senior traveller training centres &ndash; post leaving certificate courses, the vocational training opportunities scheme, adult literacy and adult and community education in the further education sector.</P>
      <P>Delivery of adult education is provided in the main by vocational education committees whose staff have greatly expanded in the past 20 years. Adult education is co-ordinated in each of the VEC areas by an adult education organiser who is responsible for supporting all adult education in the area whether it is delivered under the aegis of the VEC, the local community and comprehensive schools, local secondary schools or by other agencies.</P>
      <P>The staff in the section in 1980, 1989 and 1999 were as follows:</P>

    <P>Much of adult education provision is not financed separately, but is included as part of the overall running costs of institutions and programmes. This is the case, for example, in relation to third level participation, posts of responsibility for adult education in second level schools, running costs of vocational education committees, the cost of the prison education service etc. Excluding such costs, the Green Paper identified some £65.202 million expenditure in 1998 which could be attributed directly to adult education. The 1999 estimate for such provision is £81.071 million and represents of the order of 2.8 per cent of overall outlay on education. The increase reflects <Col N="1048" /> a full year cost of the child care measure introduced in September 1998, a rapid growth in participation of older adults on PLC courses, an increase in adult literacy provision of £2.6 million and a growth in the cost of VTOS allowances arising from the £25 incentive for long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Provision for adult literacy increased by £2.6 million to £5.665 million in 1999. Of this, some £5 million is aided by the European Social Fund. While the negotiations for EU Structural Funds for post 1999 have not yet been completed, it is expected that this area will remain a high priority for the commission. The Green Paper: Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning is committed to increasing expenditure in this critical area to at least £10 million per annum on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>The National Adult Literacy Agency is funded by grants from my Department of £370,000 in 1999 compared with £310,000 in 1998. The agency's key role is as a promotional and campaigning body in relation to adult literacy, as well as providing support materials, referral information and support for staff development and the promotion of quality standards. The 10,000 adults currently availing of literacy support are being catered for by the VEC adult literacy schemes funded directly by my Department. Both the vocational education committees and the Department work closely with the National Adult Literacy Agency in the development and delivery of the adult literacy service, and my Department has recently approved the appointment of a national adult literacy co-ordinator who will be based in NALA and will be taking up duty shortly.</P>

      <P>The National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, is funded by grants from my Department to a value of £370,000 in 1999. The agency's key role is as a promotional and campaigning body in relation to adult literacy, as well as providing support materials, referral information, and support for staff development and the promotion of quality standards. The agency has eight staff &ndash; a director, four programme development staff and three administrative staff. This includes a national adult literacy co-ordinator approved by the Department who will be taking up duty shortly and will be based in the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adult literacy training is delivered by the VEC adult literacy schemes, and the service is run by adult literacy organisers, who co-ordinate provision and match students with tutors, by paid adult literacy tutors, and by unpaid volunteers <Col N="1049" /> who work with learners on a one-to-one basis. The service operates in every VEC region and caters for some 10,000 clients at present. This will be further expanded as the provision is extended in line with increased funding.</P>
    <P>Both my Department and the vocational education committees work closely with NALA in the delivery of adult literacy services. Recent initiatives in this area include the selection of projects and priorities for funding under the National Adult Literacy Development Fund, staff development programmes, piloting of literacy over the radio, the development of a quality assurance framework for the service, and initial work in relation to provision of TV literacy and the development of an adult guidance service. NALA is also represented on the interdepartmental committee on literacy for the unemployed convened by my Department, which is working with FÁS, the local employment service, the vocational education committees and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social, Community and Family Affairs on the development of an integrated strategy in this area. In that context, FÁS has made a commitment to extend the pilot literacy community employment projects in Mullingar and Ballyfermot to all of its ten regions. In addition, there are of the order of 25 other community employment projects which play a key role in supporting the provision of the VEC literacy service.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper &ldquo;Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning&rdquo; highlighted the need for a rapid increase in investment on a phased basis to a level of at least £10 million per annum. Provision in this area has increased from a base of £0.850 million in 1987 when the Government took office to a level of £5.665 million in 1999.</P>

Where costs arise for facilities such as heating, lighting and insurance, there is provision for such costs under the adult literacy budget operated by vocational education committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the first day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions. The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grant schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other that mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circum<Col N="1051" /> stances in any case where the student is not a mature student. I understand that the student referred to in the Deputy's question wishes to be assessed as an independent mature candidate. However, as she was not aged 23 years on 1 January prior to the commencement of her third level course her eligibility for assistance must be assessed with reference to her parental income.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties that these provisions can give rise to in individual cases such as that outlined by the Deputy and officials in my Department are currently examining the issues concerned. I will inform the Deputy on the outcome of the case in due course.</P>

      <P>My Department has forwarded proposals for inclusion in the national development plan for 2000-06, which is currently being finalised by the Department of Finance. One of the key objectives of the proposals submitted, is combating social exclusion, including the provision of programmes for early school leavers. The Community Support Framework for 2000-06, will not be formulated until the national development plan has been completed and submitted to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>My Department does not fund the STEP programme operated by the YMCA, but facilitates the transmission of ESF aid to the project as and when it is received under the Operational Programme for Human Resources 1994-99. There are therefore no plans to provide transitional support for the project while a new round of EU funds is being negotiated.</P>
      <P>As regards the forthcoming Community Support Framework for 2000-06, it is not possible at this stage to say which specific programmes will be included. However, the Deputy will appreciate that there are many competing demands for the reduced level of aid under the next community support framework.</P>

      <P>An implementation plan for strand 2 of the TII is currently being finalised by my Department. In this regard also, an expert study is considering future technology infrastructure options, equipment selection, wiring, deployment of equipment, etc., for schools. I will announce the details of the strand 2 grants very shortly. I would, however, point out to the Deputy that simply repeating strand 1 would not be in keeping with achieving the objectives set out for the Schools IT 2000 programme.</P>
