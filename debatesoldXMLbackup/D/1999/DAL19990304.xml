      <P>On 10 February a Government motion was passed by the House. Will the Taoiseach tell the House what opportunity he had yesterday in Brussels to discuss the motion with Commissioner Flynn? Did he get an opportunity to have a one to one meeting with Mr. Flynn to discuss the matter? Will he clarify the discrepancy between Mr. Flynn's assessment of what he said to the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach's own assessment? This concerns a motion agreed by the House. Yesterday the Taoiseach had an opportunity to discuss it with Mr. Flynn and we want to know whether he availed of that opportunity.</P>

      <P>On Tuesday the Taoiseach indicated in reply to a question put by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, that he had no specific plans to meet Commissioner Flynn in Brussels yesterday. When were the changes in the plans made and when was it decided that the Taoiseach would meet Commissioner Flynn? I ask this in view of the potentially misleading reply the Taoiseach gave to the House on Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in the House during the extended Question Time on Tuesday my understanding was that Commissioner Flynn would be returning from America on Wednesday and that if it was possible we would meet, but that we had no confirmation of a meeting as his senior officials were with him. Very late on Tuesday night his office stated that he would be back in time and would meet me after the Commission meeting and before I met the President of the Commission, Mr. Santer. That was communicated to me on Wednesday morning at the airport. We met for 50 minutes before I met President Santer and we discussed issues surrounding Agenda 2000. As I said last night on RTE and to the media, I had a short meeting of about three minutes on other matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that. With respect, my row is not with you, a Cheann Comhairle, but with the Taoiseach regarding a question about a motion passed by this House. At his three minute meeting with Mr. Flynn, what did he say to him about the motion passed by this House? Did he relay to him the annoyance and anger of this House that his letter did not reply to the motion as passed by it? What did he discuss at that three minute meeting and was he alone or were officials present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everyone in the House would like some clarity on this matter because its entire membership passed a resolution which has a particular importance for all of us but particularly for the Fianna Fáil Party which seems to be somewhat agitated this morning. On the news coverage last night, there seemed to be slightly conflicting reports as to what was reported by the Taoiseach and by Commissioner Flynn in relation to the conversation they had. Did Commissioner Flynn indicate to the Taoiseach at the meeting yesterday that he has taken on board the sentiments of the motion passed by this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Taoiseach did not complete his statement. The reason we were told that Commissioner Flynn could not make a full statement, as requested by this House, was because of legal difficulties. Has the Taoiseach inquired into what legal difficulties arise or did he ask Commissioner Flynn, in the course of his meeting, about the legal difficulties of which he was speaking? That is the net point here. We were told we were debarred from getting a statement because of legal difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As you, a Cheann Comhairle, will know, I asked the House and the committee to move ahead on that matter. This day two weeks ago I was told by the chairman of the committee that it would endeavour to do so before St. Patrick's Day. As soon as that happens, the Government will begin to draft legislation. Deputy Rabbitte will recall there was a request in this House that we should put the draft proposals to the committee of the House. If I had not done that, we would have had the Bill a long time ago.</P>

        <b>:</b> In view of the major doubt about the effectiveness of our anti-fraud legislation &ndash; a point confirmed recently by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in one of his <i>Sunday Independent</i> instalments when he wrote an article about white collar crime going unpunished &ndash; the recent £52 million Nigerian fraud and a succession of other similar frauds which are going unpunished, what is the situation in relation to the Criminal Justice (Fraud Offences) Bill? This slipped up and down various lists. According to this publication, it is not expected before May 1999. When will we see this legislation and will the Taoiseach give it the priority status it deserves? Why does he not ensure it is brought before the House as a matter of urgency?</P>

In early January, the media reported that the Government agreed in principle on this matter, a fact supported by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, in public comments. The House was told last night by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the report that the Government had agreed in principle to issue work permits was totally false.</P>

Will the Taoiseach publish the letter EUROSTAT sent the Government on this matter, given that it has been quoted from on a number of occasions by Ministers? We in this House have a right to know the contents of that letter. In the application to EUROSTAT, were the powers of the new regional authorities outlined?</P>

    <Title>National Disability Authority Bill, 1998  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to present the National Disability Authority Bill, 1998, to the House. The Bill was initiated in the Seanad before Christmas and has benefited from a number of detailed and useful amendments made in that House. Once enacted, it will fulfil a key commitment in the Government's programme for equality, the establishment of a national disability authority. In view of the importance of the Bill, we ensured that it was given priority in the legislative programme.</P>
      <P>The impetus for the new infrastructural arrangements for disability proposed in the Bill is embedded in the concept of mainstreaming. Mainstreaming for people with disabilities represents a policy approach which seeks to the greatest extent possible, to integrate services for this group with those available to the population generally. Key State services which cater to the needs of the community will now also discharge this role in respect of members of the community who happen to have a disability. The mainstreaming approach will not supplant positive initiatives for people with disabilities but will complement and run in parallel with the targeted services.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that 360,000 people, or 10 per cent of the population, have a disability and that 40 per cent of those people are of working age. Many people with disabilities are marginalised from society and must live with the additional problems associated with marginalisation such as poverty, unemployment, social isolation and poor health. The structural reorganisation envisaged in the Bill represents a root and branch reorientation of our treatment of disability and disability issues. In changing the underlying approach which society takes to the issue of disability, we will set in train a series of actions and reactions which will draw people with disabilities back from the margins of society and change the way disability is regarded in the wider public perception.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents the culmination of a process which began in November 1997 when an establishment group for the National Disability Authority and a disability support service was set up. The establishment group was asked to report to Government with detailed proposals for the new infrastructure and the future location of departmental responsibility for the functions of the National Rehabilitation Board. The establishment group reported in June last year and in July the Government adopted its report, Building a Future Together, and approved its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> A central recommendation of the report is the setting up of the National Disability Authority. The authority will be the cornerstone of a new approach to service provision for people with disabilities. The new approach involves a departure from the traditional logic, which views disability from a medical perspective rather than as a social issue and consequently placed responsibility for services to people with disabilities with the Department of Health and Children. It will also involve the relocation of the functions currently carried out by the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>Vocational training and employment services for people with disabilities will be provided by FÁS operating under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This will be a major step in the integration of people with disabilities into the labour force enabling them to achieve independence and choice. Similarly, the information service currently provided by the National Rehabilitation Board will, under the new arrangements, be provided through Comhairle, a new mainstream information providing service being established by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This development will underscore the fact that as citizens people with disabilities are entitled to information and entitlements in the same way as any other citizen. A number of other services, such as the excellent audiology service provided by the National Rehabilitation Board, will continue to be available through the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The National Disability Authority will provide the essential overview of the new arrangement and its central focus will be the provision of services to people with disabilities. The authority will be a watchdog of standards in services for people with disabilities. Its purpose will be to function as an expert body dedicated to the development of standards in services provided to people with disabilities and to conduct independent monitoring of these services. The authority will not be a service providing agency, but it will work in close co-operation with service providers in the voluntary, State and Government sectors.</P>
    <P>To assist it in implementing this agenda, the authority will commission independent research and promote innovative projects. As a dedicated body, it will be a source of guidance and support to all service providers. It will assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities to people with disabilities and secure their co-operation in developing the best possible standards. The authority will offer guidance and support not only to organisations in the disability sector, but also to mainstream service providers as they meet their obligations to people with disabilities. The new organisation will report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will assist in the development of a coherent approach to disability policy which will have direct application to all service providers. The Bill will empower the new organisation working in the Department to <Col N="1036" /> take a lead role in ensuring the delivery of high quality services to people with disabilities in an integrated way.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides a clear focus for the new organisation in relation to the development of standards, policy and research. The establishment group in making its recommendations to Government strongly advised against burdening the authority with functions which would detract from its core role. It also recommended against any direct link to service provision as such responsibilities would run counter to its role as a guide and support to service providers. For these reasons, the new infrastructural and administrative arrangements will assign tasks related to service provision to other agencies.</P>
    <P>Under the Government, a number of initiatives have been introduced and substantial increases have been made in funding for disability services. These reflect the commitment of the Government to continuously advancing the position of people with disabilities to enable them to achieve greater independence and to participate more fully in the life of the nation. In the area of education, a number of initiatives targeted at children with disabilities are being undertaken. Examples of these initiatives are the provision this year of £4 million for additional teachers and child care assistants for children with disabilities and £1.7 million for escorts and special harnesses for children with disabilities on school buses.</P>
    <P>In the area of health, additional revenue of £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000, has been made available to help tackle the deficit in accommodation and other services for people with learning difficulties, to furnish health related support services for children with autism and to meet identified needs in these services. A capital allowance of at least £10 million is also being made available in 1999 to support the creation of 320 new residential places, 80 new respite places and 200 new day places. In keeping with the Government's commitment to developing services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, a total of £9.325 million has been made available for the provision of aids and appliances. Once off grants totalling almost £6 million were made to voluntary agencies in the sector in 1997 and additional revenue totalling £5.4 million in 1998 and £9.4 million in 1999, rising to £12.4 million on a full year basis in 2000, has been provided for the maintenance and development of services in this sector with further allocations for capital projects. It is against this background of service provision and entitlement that the authority and the other new mainstreaming measures are being introduced and will operate.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the National Disability Authority will provide the link between Government policy and funding for disability and the services and quality of service that are provided to people with disabilities. I am convinced that it, as an expert body, has a vital contribution to make to informed policy formulation and service delivery <Col N="1037" /> from which the current and future Governments will benefit.</P>
    <P>I will outline to the House some of the main features of the Bill which is divided into three parts as follows: Part I contains standard and technical provisions; Part II provides generally for the role and functions of the authority and the requirements in relation to its members, chief executive and staff; Part III contains provisions arising from the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>Part I, comprising sections 1 to 5, contains preliminary and general provisions. Section 1 provides for the short title of the Bill, section 3 provides for the establishment day, section 4 gives the powers to make orders and regulations and section 5 makes provision in relation to expenses.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is a definitions section. Disability is defined in this section as follows: &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in relation to a person, means a substantial restriction in the capacity of a person to participate in economic, social, or cultural life on account of an enduring physical, sensory, learning, mental health or emotional impairment.</P>
    <P>Part II comprises sections 6 to 19 of the Bill. Section 6 provides for the establishment of the authority and for its corporate rights and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the authority will be independent in the performance of its functions. Section 8 provides for the functions of the authority. Its principal function will be to advise the Minister and keep him or her informed of developments in relation to any disability of persons which concern issues of policy and practice.</P>
    <P>Section 9 requires the authority to prepare and submit to the Minister strategic plans relating to its objectives and strategies. Section 10 empowers the authority, following appropriate consultation, to prepare draft codes of practice aimed at achieving good standards and quality in programmes and services for people with a disability.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows the authority to appoint advisory committees and to engage consultants or advisers to assist it in the performance of its functions. Section 12 provides that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, confer additional functions on the authority. Section 13 gives the authority a right of access to relevant information and data held by a public body except where the information or data sought is of a private or personal nature or its disclosure is precluded by law.</P>
    <P>Section 14 empowers the authority to seek information on matters concerning the provision of programmes or services for people with a disability from persons, including public bodies, who have overall responsibility for their provision. Where there is a requirement in law to provide a programme or service to persons with a disability, or where a programme or service for people with a disability is in receipt of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, the authority may seek information regarding the provision of that service and the manner in which it is being provided. Where <Col N="1038" /> the authority determines that such a programme or service is not being provided or that it is inadequate or unsatisfactory in any manner, there is provision for the authority to inform the person or body concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the submission by the authority of an annual report to the Minister and for the laying of each such report before each House of the Oireachtas. The section also empowers the authority to make other reports to the Minister and, where these relate to its role in monitoring standards and codes of practice in programmes and services provided to people with a disability, it empowers the authority to make recommendations for the review, reduction or withdrawal of any moneys provided by the Oireachtas for a programme or service.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 are standard provisions covering grants and the accounts and audit of the authority. Section 18 provides for the procedures and business of the authority. Section 19 contains standard provisions relating to the seal of the authority. Section 20 provides for the membership of the authority. The authority will comprise a chairperson and 20 ordinary members, including an elected member of its staff.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 to 24 deal with the terms of office of the members of the authority, the filling of casual vacancies and the meetings and proceedings of the authority. Section 25 provides for the appointment of a chief executive of the authority. The first chief executive will be appointed by the Minister and, thereafter, the chief executive will be appointed by the authority. Section 26 deals with the functions of the chief executive. Section 27 provides for the appointment of persons as staff of the authority. The authority is required by the section to have regard to arrangements for conciliation and arbitration in place when determining the terms and conditions of its staff.</P>
    <P>Section 28 places a requirement on the authority to put in place a scheme or schemes for granting superannuation benefits to or in respect of its staff.</P>
    <P>Provision is made that where a member of staff was, immediately prior to his or her appointment to the authority, an officer or servant of the National Rehabilitation Board, the terms and conditions of the superannuation benefits granted under a scheme made by the authority shall not be less favourable than those which previously applied.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 to 33 are standard provisions relating to the disclosures, declarations and disqualifications relating to the authority. Section 34 provides that a review of the legislation is to be initiated not later than three years after the establishment of the authority.</P>
    <P>Part III comprises sections 35 to 38 of the Bill. This Part provides the necessary link between the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961 and the provisions of this Bill in relation to the authority and the other agencies and Departments concerned. These sections deal with issues arising as a result of the dissolution of the National <Col N="1039" /> Rehabilitation Board and the transfer of the staff, assets and liabilities of the board to the authority and the other agencies and Departments involved in the new infrastructural and administrative arrangements. The necessary orders to effect these transfers will be made by the Minister for Health and Children under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>Section 35 is a definition section in relation to this part of the Bill. Section 36 makes provision in regard to pay and conditions of service of members of staff of the authority who, immediately prior to their appointment, were serving as officers or servants of National Rehabilitation Board. Except where there is a collective agreement negotiated with a recognised trade union or staff association concerned, such members of staff shall not, while in the employ of the authority, receive a lesser scale of pay or be made subject to less beneficial terms and conditions of service than they had been entitled to before their assignment to the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 37 extends the scope of section 7 of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961 to include the authority or other public body. The public bodies concerned are in effect, FÁS, under the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Comhairle and the new information service being established under the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. As a consequence, the Minister for Health and Children may, with the consent of the appropriate Minister, make orders to transfer or assign property enjoyed, or liabilities incurred, by the National Rehabilitation Board which have not been discharged prior to such transfer or assignment, to the authority or other public body.</P>
    <P>Section 38 makes a further link with section 7(2) of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961 by providing that the Minister for Health and Children may make an order under that Act for the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board and the transfer of property rights and liabilities, not transferred to the authority or other public body under section 37, or of staff, not appointed to the authority or other public body. These provisions deal with the dissolution of the National Rehabilitation Board and the relocation of departmental responsibility for its functions, assets and staff.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the board for the work which it has done over the past 30 years. I also commend the NRB and its staff for the way in which it has contributed to the changes being introduced and for being at the forefront of the call for this change. I am confident that its staff, who will transfer to the new structures, will continue to provide excellent standards of service for people with a disability.</P>
    <P>I commend the National Disability Authority Bill to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this important Bill. In <Col N="1040" /> doing so I acknowledge the work the Minister of State has done and her commitment to issues relating to disability over a long period.</P>
      <P>This important Bill seeks to establish on a statutory basis an authority which will, in the words of the explanatory memorandum empower and enable people with a disability to achieve and exercise their economic, social, political and civil rights. We are talking about 10 per cent of the population. We are talking about their lifestyle, their opportunities and how they are treated in society.</P>
      <P>The <i>raison d'être</i> for this Bill and for the NDA, which it statutorily establishes, comes from the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, entitled A Strategy for Equality.</P>
      <P>One submission to the commission stated:</P>
      <P>People with disabilities do not want to be pitied nor do they want their disabilities to be dismissed as of little importance. All that is required is a little respect of basic needs and rights. Surely that is not too much to ask.</P>
      <P>It is disturbing and, indeed, distressing to read the commission's conclusion which stated:</P>
      <P>People with disabilities are the neglected citizens of Ireland. On the eve of the 21st century many of them suffer intolerable conditions because of outdated social and economic policies and unthinking public attitudes. Changes have begun to come about influenced by international recognition that disability is a social rather than a medical issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome this change, which is reflected in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The commission further states:</P>
      <P>Many of the changes have been piecemeal. Public attitudes towards disability are still based on charity, rather than on rights, and the odds are stacked as we approach the 21st century against people with disabilities at almost every turn. Whether their status is looked at in terms of economics, information, education, mobility or housing they are treated as second class citizens. They want, and are entitled to, equality and full participation as citizens.</P>
      <P>The commission comprised representatives of a huge number of organisations dealing with disabilities. That is the background and culture from which the national disability authority emerges.</P>
      <P>I welcome the move to mainstreaming but extraordinary care must be taken to monitor and evaluate how it is working. It is easy to lose specialist services and positive action when such a move takes place. This has been experienced in other areas. However, I welcome the Minister of State's statement that positive action initiatives will not be lost in this move. I cannot emphasise enough their importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People with physical, sensory or learning disabilities, and those with mental handicap, their families, advocates and carers have for too long <Col N="1041" /> heard words such as &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo;, &ldquo;integrate&rdquo;, &ldquo;power&rdquo; and &ldquo;enable&rdquo;. They have experienced and continue to experience marginalisation, exclusion and powerlessness. I am constantly struck when I talk to certain individuals about the problems they face in terms of accessibility, for example, by how much each of them continually must reinvent the wheel, how difficult it is and the great strength and courage they need to take on the system.</P>
    <P>For example, last December John Doyle held a vigil outside the headquarters of CIE to protest at the lack of wheelchair accessible public transport. When interviewed on radio, he described how, in order to use public transport, he must be carried on to a bus and be willing to crawl on the bus. I am sure that Dublin Bus and the Minister for Public Enterprise, who has political and administrative responsibility for public transport, did not set out to deliberately exclude John Doyle and other wheelchair users. They have plans to increase the wheelchair accessible bus fleet, but not for some time. The order for 150 new non-wheelchair accessible buses was to answer the need for an expanded bus fleet. That the buses are not accessible to wheelchair users was seen as almost incidental. The needs and rights of persons with disabilities were yet again overlooked when the order was placed.</P>
    <P>Despite commitments from successive Governments, the priority afforded to the needs and rights of persons with a disability in Partnership 2000, the recommendations of reports such as Towards an Independent Future and A Strategy for Equality and the raising of public consciousness of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates, change is coming about painfully slowly. However, we are entering a new era and given the number of reports that have been commissioned, the new consciousness that exists and the commitment on all sides of this House, the pace of change will accelerate.</P>
    <P>That disability issues were primarily viewed as medical and, therefore, came under the auspices of the Department of Health was a contributor to marginalisation and a barrier to full integration. It is welcome that in recent years a social mode to mainstreaming services for people with a disability has been adopted.</P>
    <P>The first dissenting voices among disabled people were heard in the 1970s and in the 1980s and 1990s disabled people began to organise effectively to take more control of their lives. Many reports were commissioned but the implementation of recommendations must appear to many, who require enhanced services, to be happening at a snail's pace.</P>
    <P>The empowerment of those with disabilities within organisations which fight for new services and represent the disabled is extremely important. It is generally agreed that many services adopted a paternalistic approach to those to whom they were providing such services in the past but, thankfully, that is changing. However, the new authority will have a pivotal role in <Col N="1042" /> ensuring that public policy will not only pay lip service to mainstreaming and inclusiveness, but will deliver on its many aspirations. This will not be an easy task and it is vital that it is seen to tackle the many and varied obstacles which remain in the way of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, they include lack of services for many people, which I will outline later. I already mentioned the inaccessibility of public transport in Dublin and it is not a problem unique to the capital. It is felt acutely in rural areas where there may not even be a bus service. The new authority I hope will demand that in future public transport vehicles, which are not fully accessible to all citizens, will not be purchased. The same problem applies to taxis. It is evident that, while recently issued taxi licences were contingent on the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles, there is not a similar onus on taxi owners or companies to use their taxis to transport wheelchair users. Recent evidence suggests that the owners and drivers of such taxis sometimes prefer to use their vehicles to transport people with a great deal of luggage or those encumbered with sets of golf clubs rather than those for whose needs the taxis were supposed to cater. This scandal must not be allowed to continue. The licensing authority for taxis is a publicly accountable body and the taxi lobby is a powerful voice in Dublin. We hope the NDA will have a more powerful voice and that wheelchair accessible taxis will be available for hire to those who really need them. If that were the case people would not need to highlight this issue on radio or at constituency clinics.</P>
    <P>How much more empowered or mobile are people even in a brand new wheelchair if they cannot get on a bus? How much more independent are they if they cannot get a taxi? How mainstreamed are they if they cannot travel on main streets or access public buildings? Until the arrival of former Senator, Brian Crowley, this building, the seat of Parliament, was inaccessible to wheelchair users. We are only now focusing on the exclusion of a sizeable proportion of the population from easy access to public facilities. I welcome the recent moves by the Minster for the Environment and Local Government to address this problem.</P>
    <P>The review group on health and personal services for people with physical and sensory disabilities referred to various problems. It highlighted a lack of comprehensive data on numbers and service needs; inadequate access to information on service provision; disparities in eligibility criteria between health board areas and even within health boards; inadequate statutory financial funding for individuals; uncertain funding of voluntary organisations and shortfalls in service relating to therapy, day care, counselling and home support. All Members are aware of how serious that problem is.</P>
    <P>There are still relatively few supports for a carer looking after a young physically handicapped child at home in terms of occupational therapy, home help and nursing care. I am fre<Col N="1043" /> quently struck by the dearth of such services and how difficult it is to obtain them. The report also highlighted uneven geographic distribution of services, inadequate transport services, inadequate co-ordination of services and poor consumer choice. It is a litany of disaster and the recommendations in the report are designed to overcome these inadequacies, uncertainties and shortfalls. Whatever excuse there was in the past, one hopes that in the current economic climate the Minister will obtain the necessary resources to begin to address this area which has been neglected over a long period.</P>
    <P>An important recommendation in the report is the establishment of a database which would allow all statutory and voluntary agencies to ascertain the scale of the problem. This, in turn, would allow for proper planning and financial provision to be made to address the needs of the thousands of people who lack even the most basic supports. Everyone agrees that the national intellectual disability database has proved invaluable in establishing the numbers of people with mental handicap requiring a service. Information is power, and if one has the basic data the services needed can be planned and delivered. It is amazing no such database is available to identify the needs of those with a physical or sensory disability. Without the information gathered by voluntary agencies, we would have no idea of the number of citizens with a physical or sensory disability.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association has done valuable work in establishing that, of its members, 2,667 people do not benefit from day activity or development. One of the points many people have made recently is the number of people in wheelchairs one sees in the new shopping centres, which are wheelchair accessible. Many people in wheelchairs who were not able to go shopping are now able to access those shopping centres and that is welcome. However, it highlights the secret lives so many people had to live before these shopping centres and shops generally became accessible.</P>
    <P>There is still a huge number of people, almost 3,000, who do not benefit from any day activity or development. Some 1,200 are physically isolated and are prisoners in their homes, 1,100 require aids and appliances and 1,300 require personal assistance for basic needs such as dressing and feeding. The personal assistant scheme is invaluable and those who use it to whom I have spoken cannot say enough about how wonderful it is and the freedom it gives them. It is difficult to recruit people to that service. The NDA should give special attention to it because it is a scheme which offers great support and opportunity to those who are disabled.</P>
    <P>It must be asked how many thousands more who are not members of the IWA require services. Other voluntary organisations working in the sector have carried out equally valuable work in assessing the needs of their members and the <Col N="1044" /> people who avail of their services. However, there is a need for a national database.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the new authority's remit will include the collection and assessment of data. I hope it will also include the compilation of a database. In response to a question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Theresa Ahearn, the Minister for Health and Children stated the Department has established a database development committee which is preparing detailed proposals for the development of a database. I hope the NDA will have an active role in ensuring the database is used to establish the true extent of the needs of this sector, that the discrepancies in services outlined earlier in the various regions will be eliminated, that we will aspire to a national standard of services and that there will not be this huge variation which exists at present.</P>
    <P>The national intellectual disability database will give very useful information to the new authority and will also indicate the scale of the task to be undertaken. The database identifies almost 27,000 people with a mental handicap or intellectual disability. Of these, 604 receive no service from the State, 22,800 are receiving some service, and almost 1,500 await residential and respite care, which is one person in every 20 on the database. Many also await day care. I have further statistics which I do not have time to quote, but those I have given outline the scale of the challenge facing the NDA.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children says the average age of those requiring residential placement is 31.6 years. These are very young people who have a life ahead of them and who need more support than they receive at present. The average age of those requiring day places is 35. The age profile of those identified as requiring these services has a significant implication. Elderly parents are caring for middle aged and older sons or daughters. Parents in their 70s and 80s are caring for their adult, mentally handicapped sons and daughters. Apart from the daily physical and emotional demands on them, there is the fear of what will happen to their child if they die or become incapacitated. This is a major problem for people and, if they can be assured there are good quality day and residential services in their locality, it will at least give them some reassurance about the future.</P>
    <P>This is the challenge facing service providers, statutory and non-statutory, and it is the challenge for the National Disability Authority. The success of the authority, while not a service provider, will be measured against its performance in ensuring targets are reached and deadlines met in terms of services. One can see the difficulty of meeting targets in this area. The public service currently has a target of 3 per cent employment of those with a disability. I do not believe that has ever been met and an interesting question is what sanction the NDA will bring to bear on the public service. The authority will have to have the powers and sanctions to compel agencies, includ<Col N="1045" /> ing those of the State, to comply with their obligations.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome. There are, however, a number of areas which give cause for concern. Section 8 sets out the functions of the authority, and section 8 (2)(d) specifies one of the functions as:</P>
    <P>To monitor the implementation of standards and codes of practice in programmes and services provided to persons with disabilities and to report to the Minister thereon;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State could state what the term &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; means in these circumstances. It is essential there is clarity in the legislation in the setting of standards and the monitoring of services between all agencies. We must be careful in framing the legislation to ensure there can be no confusion of responsibilities. For example, what relationship will there be between the schools inspectorate and the NDA regarding special schools? Perhaps the Minister could address that. Are links envisaged between the NDA, the Office of the Ombudsman and the new social services inspectorate and, if so, what will they be? How will the new authority interact with the new Eastern Regional Health Authority, which will, according to the Bill establishing it which is currently before the House, oversee the provision of all health and personal social services in the region, and which is charged with putting in place systems to monitor and evaluate the services provided? We were discussing the Bill in the House yesterday and it is important the mode of interaction and the links which will be built between the National Disability Authority and the Eastern Regional Health Authority be worked out, especially the lines of communication and the breakdown of responsibilities between the two.</P>
    <P>Many voluntary organisations are concerned there is no grievance procedure for individuals provided within the remit of the NDA. It has been said that sufficient grievance procedures exist under the Employment Equality Act as well as through the Ombudsman. However, given the wide monitoring remit of the proposed authority, and having regard to services provided to individuals, for example, those with severe learning difficulties or mental handicap, should the legislation not also provide a grievance procedure, since the remit of the NDA covers the most vulnerable people in society? Is it not a deficiency in the legislation that it provides no recourse for an individual to make a formal complaint about services or the lack of them? This is of concern to many voluntary agencies and is something I hope can be addressed in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the composition of the membership of the authority is heavily weighted in favour of people with disabilities, their representatives, families and carers. All the people appointed are knowledgeable and committed in their own right. That said, there is a perception, right or wrong, that the members appointed from individual <Col N="1046" /> agencies were appointed without full consultation with the agencies of which they are members. There is a perception that individuals were appointed who happened to be members of a certain agency rather than formal representatives of the agency concerned. I am worried this perception might dilute the authority of the board. Perhaps the Minister of State would explain the ethos behind the appointments. It may not be a problem, but I would like the Minister of State to address it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the chair of the new authority, there is an implicit issue of conflict of interest in that the chair of the new authority, a woman of the highest expertise and integrity, comes from one of the main services providers whose service provision will be monitored by the authority. I raise this because it may be in the chairwoman's interest in a situation such as this, and for future possible appointments of people from the main services providers, that there be guidelines regarding conflicts of interest laid down by the authority. Decisions will obviously arise which will concern or affect the agency from which the chair comes in terms of services and allocation of resources and finance. It would be helpful to persons who finds themselves in that situation if there were clarity about it.</P>
    <P>There is concern among staff of the NRB, to whom we should pay tribute on their excellent work over 30 years, that there will be a diminution of services, not in relation to the transfer to FÁS but specifically in relation to Comhairle. I have fond memories of the NRB where as a young social worker I completed my first placement. I was struck then by the high standards of service. In the creation of the new structures people with disabilities should have a net gain in service provision. Those involved in the excellent specialist services in the NRB have gained expertise during the years. This should be transferred to the new organisation. Mergers present great difficulties for staff. There is a need, therefore, to provide support and reassurance that their expertise is valued and will be retained. The Minister of State should pay particular attention to this issue and take action to ensure this is done in the best possible way. There is a need for management to provide information on what is happening to staff.</P>
    <P>The requirement to achieve a transfer of services to the different entities without an increase in resources may be problematic in relation to Comhairle and, to some extent, the NDA. The staff must be listened to. They must be given an opportunity to voice their concerns if the NDA is to work effectively.</P>
    <P>All the official documents and reports on delivery of policy and services for people with disabilities have common aspirations &ndash; quality, accountability, effectiveness, value and partnership. The challenge for all the voluntary and statutory agencies, the NDA in particular, is to translate these aspirations for better services for people with disabilities into reality. It is essential <Col N="1047" /> to get the Bill right and vital that the authority has a clear mission from the outset. Ambiguity in relation to responsibilities or conflict in regard to relationships with other monitoring bodies could be damaging. The authority must have the confidence and support of everyone involved in the disability sector, not least those with disabilities. It would be unforgivable if we were to fail them yet again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a National Disability Authority was one of the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, A Strategy for Equality. In that context I welcome the legislation. The authority will prove a valuable watchdog and guarantor of services. I congratulate the Minister of State on her commitment to equality issues. I question, however, the commitment of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department in terms of the priority given to equality issues. Equality legislation is not given the place it deserves. It would be better to have a separate Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Tánaiste indicated on the Order of Business that the Equal Status Bill is not expected until after Easter. This is disappointing. We were informed initially that it would be published by the end of 1998. We were then informed it would be published before Easter. That Bill would make a significant difference in protecting the rights of people with disabilities and the other categories catered for. The implementation of the Employment Equality Act is also awaited. There should be no further delays with regard to this legislation.</P>
      <P>At the weekend I attended the annual SIPTU women's conference in Ennis at which widespread concern was expressed among the hundreds of delegates that the Equal Status Bill is still not available to those who need a mechanism for redress. I congratulate SIPTU on producing an excellent guide to the Employment Equality Act, by Donnacha O'Connell, which was launched at the conference and which will prove most useful. The focus at the conference was on the position of women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other groups are anxiously awaiting these measures. I received a letter on the subject last week from the Limerick Travellers Development Group and draw the Minister of State's attention to an incident in Limerick reported on the front page of the <i>Limerick Leader</i> where three traveller women alleged they were refused entry to a cinema for no obvious or stated reason. They could take action under equal status legislation. A study commissioned by the western province of the Sisters of Mercy published this week reveals a disturbing level of intolerance of asylum seekers, refugees, travellers, gays and lesbians. People with physical disabilities were discriminated against by Dublin Bus when before Christmas it purchased new buses which are not wheelchair <Col N="1048" /> accessible. Deputy Fitzgerald dealt in detail with the question of access to transport. This could have been addressed with an appropriate section in an equal status Bill. I included such a section in my Bill published in December. Equality issues should be placed centre stage.</P>
    <P>This legislation should be stronger. The commission in making its recommendations in this regard envisaged a stronger Bill which would have teeth and which would ensure the rights of people with disabilities are vindicated. The role of the authority will be to monitor and make recommendations on standards rather than enforce the equal rights of people with disabilities. How will the legislation improve access to and standards of service and care? My party will table amendments, as it did in the Seanad, to improve and strengthen the Bill. I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to accept proposals designed to make the authority a body of genuine use to people with disabilities in establishing their right to quality services in accordance with their needs.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for introducing section 15(4) on Committee Stage in the Seanad which provides for sanctions where a service provider is considered to be making less than good use of public money. My colleagues in the Seanad argued strongly for this measure. I welcome the Minister of State's willingness to be persuaded on this.</P>
    <P>The authority has been established on a non-statutory basis. The Minister of State is aware of the reservations expressed concerning the make-up of the authority and the selection of the chairperson in particular. The reservations do not question the abilities or qualities of the individual concerned but the fact that she is employed by one of the main service providers. I and many others involved in the disability movement would have expected the chairperson of the authority to be somebody not involved in the provision of services so that the authority's role as an independent watchdog and the setter and guardian of standards would be beyond question. Will the Minister of State consider this issue following the enactment of the legislation? I presume the current board is provisional as it was established before the legislation was introduced. Perhaps this could be examined following the establishment of the authority under statute. I know from representations I received from organisations, which reflect the views of people with disabilities, that they would be more satisfied with an authority chaired by somebody who would not have the role of a service provider, wearing one hat, and that of chair of an independent watchdog for the provision of services, wearing another. I would welcome the views of the Minister on this matter.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy Fitzgerald stated concerning the representatives of other groups on the authority. Ideally, they should not be individuals nominated by the Minister but chosen representatives of the groups concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> People with disabilities encounter many difficulties in their daily lives that should be minimised by law and Government spending. These two aspects &ndash; the underpinning of rights through legislation and the provision of funding for appropriate services, are interlinked, and I hope the National Disability Authority will play an effective role in ensuring the individual with a disability, whether intellectual, physical or sensory, will not have to constantly fight battles to access his or her constitutional rights and to lead a full socially integrated life from the cradle to the grave.</P>
    <P>The practical experience of people with disabilities and their families is that they go from one struggle to another as their needs change and they do not seem to get what they need, as of right. Everything has to be fought for, often against the equally deserving needs of someone else on the waiting list. This should not be the case. It is our duty as legislators to establish a framework whereby people can access what they need without having to struggle for it at every turn.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State agrees with me that a disabilities Bill will be required to achieve this in a comprehensive way. I again ask the Minister to indicate the timeframe on the proposed disabilities Bill, which is on the Government's legislative programme. It appears to be quite distant and the queue in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not going to assist matters. I urge that, as soon as the equal status Bill has been dealt with, focus should turn immediately to this legislation so that the insatiable demands from the justice side of the portfolio are not allowed to swamp the equally important, but unfortunately not equally prioritised, equality side of the portfolio.</P>
    <P>A disabilities Bill should seek to ensure the onus is on the State, not on the individual or his or her family, to provide for each person's requirements as they grow and develop. I have begun to research legislation, particularly in the US and in other EU countries, to see what we can hope to achieve and learn from the positive and negative experiences of other jurisdictions which are further advanced than us in this regard. Norway, for example, appears to have been successful in integrating and providing for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>This is a matter for the future but, by keeping pressure on the Minister, I intend to ensure it is for the near rather than the distant future. Focused legislation is essential to fully safeguard the rights of people with disabilities. It will be necessary to propose an amendment to the Constitution to ensure property rights do not supersede individual human and personal rights in a way which excludes people with disabilities from full participation in society.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill before us, people with disabilities need to have an appropriate forum and an effective body to ensure their needs are provided for. Inevitably, a number of Departments <Col N="1050" /> are involved, and I welcome the statement in the Minister's speech that it is the intention that the National Disability Authority will fulfil this role in drawing together the various aspects of the rights of people with disabilities covered by different Departments. I hope the authority strengthens the case for adequate funding for needs already clearly identified. For example, the national database of people with intellectual disabilities, to which Deputy Fitzgerald referred, and the local co-ordinating committees have listed and tabulated the unmet needs of people with intellectual disabilities for residential and day care places, community services and supports. In my region, for example, there is an identified urgent need for an additional 76 residential places and 81 day care places, but the Mid-Western Health Board has received funding to pay for only an extra 19 residential and 17 day-care places this year.</P>
    <P>Having established a database and a representational implementing committee in each health board area, and in the current buoyant economic climate where the Minister for Finance has such a healthy surplus in his coffers, there is no justifiable reason for not providing for the services which are clearly required. This shortfall has been highlighted tirelessly for many years by the national body which represents parents and friends of those with an intellectual disability. I commend Mr. Ger South of the Limerick Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped, who has done trojan work to highlight this issue with all political parties, whether in power or Opposition. It is that kind of lobbying which has been extremely effective in raising this issue, but we have not responded adequately to it. The money is in the coffers now and it simply must be released.</P>
    <P>Other bodies, like the Irish Wheelchair Association, have identified urgent needs for other people with disabilities, particularly the need for aids and appliances, day care centres and physical access to buildings and services. I know there is a shortage of community-based professionals, such as occupational therapists, which can often mean having to wait for months for a necessary appliance or service.</P>
    <P>This week the rigidity of the conditions under the disabled driver's scheme has been exposed by a blind man who is dependent on his wife to get around. There are two unresolved cases on my books, where the individuals concerned have a medically verified disability which requires alterations to their cars, yet these have been questioned and I do not know if they will be accepted under the disabled driver's scheme.</P>
    <P>Last year I dealt with a young man who has frequent seizures and needs a special seat in the passenger side of his parents' car so he can be taken out by his mother when he has a seizure without her having to manoeuvre him around in a way which is impossible if he is highly distressed and physically unable to control his movements. <Col N="1051" /> It was a long struggle to have the validity of this case accepted.</P>
    <P>I urge that there be more flexibility in that scheme; in my experience it is extremely rigid. Life is difficult enough for such parents without having to battle with the system. I hope the disabilities authority plays a positive role in taking some of this burden away from individual families. I am sure other Deputies can cite similar examples.</P>
    <P>Fighting for their rights takes its toll on families which are already coping with more than the rest of us. Access to appropriate education should be easier, not harder, for children with learning difficulties, whether they are severely handicapped, autistic, mildly mentally handicapped, which would allow them to be integrated into regular State schools or with conditions like dyslexia, ADD and ADHD, which require particular teaching expertise to allow the child to participate to his or her potential in the educational process and in social and economic life.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the money which was allocated in the budget to provide for some of these children but it is not nearly enough to respond to the needs. I urge the Department of Education and Science to stop giving us replies to parliamentary questions on conditions such as dyslexia and ADD which state that remedial teachers can deal with all of this. They are not trained, resourced or provided in sufficient numbers to do this.</P>
    <P>On Monday night, I attended a public meeting in Limerick &ndash; a follow-up to another one two weeks ago &ndash; of parents of children with dyslexia who were trying to keep open a school which was set up privately to respond to the needs of dyslexic children and which is having great success in changing radically for the better the lives of many children in the mid-west and in other areas outside the region. These parents are not only fighting to keep the school open but to ensure the education system follows up on these problems so that their children are not the privileged few who have been able to benefit from diagnosis and expertise. They want the Department of Education and Science to cater within the system for such children who are estimated to represent as much as 10 per cent of the population. These parents are holding table quizzes and putting groceries into bags in supermarkets to raise funding to give their children a chance, but they are aware that this should be available to all children who need it. I hope the disability authority will have a role in nudging the Department of Education and Science into recognising its responsibilities to these children.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the mid-west support group for ADD and ADHD made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Health and Children last week which portrayed the chaos in families which must cope with a child with ADD who has not been diagnosed, treated or appropriately provided for. I hope the disability authority also plays a role in making progress in this regard. The reason I refer <Col N="1052" /> to organisations from the mid-west is that I know the work they do, but I am sure similar organisations are doing similar work in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In her contribution, Deputy Fitzgerald outlined many other shortfalls and gaps in the service. I hope these will be addressed under the aegis of the National Disability Authority. I support her call for a comprehensive database on the variety of disabilities similar to the one that already exists on intellectual disabilities.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas where useful work can be done. I hope the authority will carry out a disability audit on the work and work places of Government Departments, local authorities and health boards, and any new measures or proposals that will impinge, either negatively or positively, on the lives of people with disabilities. Mainstreaming will not happen unless it is in the mind of everyone who plans, designs, recruits or carries out other such functions; Dublin Bus is a good example of this.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent employment quota for people with disabilities in public bodies should be strictly monitored and examined for its quality as well as its quantity because job satisfaction is just as important to a disabled person as to anyone else. Disabled people should be given the opportunities generally available to prove their abilities rather than have the focus on their disabilities.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday the Forum for People with Disabilities called on the Department of the Environment and Local Government to enforce the implementation of section M of the building regulations claiming they are frequently breached. The authority and the Minister must ensure that access officers are in place and are doing their job in an effective manner. It is important that local authorities are vigilant in relation to obstructions, particularly on footpaths. Advertising signs, etc. are frequently placed on footpaths which cause obstruction and there is an onus on local authorities to monitor that and ensure it does not happen.</P>
    <P>This week the National Training and Development Unit pointed out that services such as bank ATM machines and public telephones often cause insurmountable difficulties for people in wheelchairs. This thoughtlessness on the part of key service providers is inexcusable. The National Disability Authority should pay immediate attention to these organisations and ensure they respond.</P>
    <P>Because these issues and others need to be addressed, I am concerned that the new National Disability Authority has the necessary powers to effect change and enforce rights. The amendment made in the Seanad on section 15 goes some of the way towards this but I would prefer to see sanctions clearly spelled out and a mechanism in place that would enable people with disabilities and their families use the authority as a champion of their individual rights across the spectrum.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill we sought to amend <Col N="1053" /> in the Seanad and which we will again address on Committee Stage is the number of staff representatives on the authority. The number should be increased from that which is currently allowed and I intend to table an amendment in that regard.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the excellent work done by the NRB over the years and I hope there will be a seamless transfer of its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the new authority, we must ensure there is not a duplication of work done by other bodies such as the Equality Authority that will be set up under the Employment Equality Act, the National Council for People with Disabilities and the Disability Federation. It is the Minister's responsibility to ensure this does not happen.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome but I will endeavour to strengthen it in the course of its passage through the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The rights of disabled people must be paramount in any society. The economy is performing well at this time. Growth rates are set to reach 10 per cent this year but the Celtic tiger is not worth its name unless the disadvantaged in our society are given the maximum assistance to improve their standard of life and quality of living.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Government, and ourselves as legislators, to implement legislation which ensures that the rights of disabled people are protected and enhanced. That is the reason I welcome the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>I will refer to the provisions of the Bill and future policies the State may implement to improve the lives of disabled persons and their families. The main emphasis of the Bill provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of a National Disability Authority. The purpose of this authority will be to empower and enable people with disabilities to achieve and exercise their economic, social, political and civil rights. These are basic constitutional rights and the NDA is now entrusted to advise the Government on key policy changes which may be brought about to improve the lives of disabled people. Its primary role will be to support the development of standards, identify current best practice and monitor the implementation of standards. The National Disability Authority will operate as a support to other organisations and secure their co-operation in developing state of the art standards and policies at international level. It will commission independent research and promote innovative projects in the disability sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Disability Authority will not of itself be a service providing agency but will function as an expert body dedicated to research and development of disability related issues and as an independent monitoring body reporting directly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As a dedicated body, the NDA will be a source of guidance and support to the main<Col N="1054" /> stream service providers in fulfilling their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the legislation merit close analysis. Section 9 requires the authority to prepare and submit to the Minster at three year intervals plans relating to its objectives and strategies. Section 11 empowers the authority to appoint advisory committees and engage consultants or advisers to assist in the performance of its duties. This is a sensible proposal for the simple reason that it would be unfortunate if the authority was not given the appropriate tools to carry out its duties in a uniform and composite manner.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, confer additional powers and functions relating to the disability of persons on the authority. This is a welcome provision given that the NDA may wish to seek additional powers if its mandate is to be performed to its optimum.</P>
    <P>Under section 13, the authority is to be given a right of access to information and data relevant to the disability of persons and held by public bodies except where the information or data sought is of a private or personal nature or its disclosure is precluded by law. This also means that the authority is entitled to seek information on matters concerning the provision of programmes or services for persons with disabilities from public bodies and other persons with overall responsibility for their provision. Where, in the opinion of the authority, certain programmes or services for persons with disabilities are not provided or are inadequate in their provision, the authority is required to inform the person or body concerned of its opinion.</P>
    <P>I welcome that the NDA is obliged to submit an annual report before the Houses of the Oireachtas for our consideration. This will give us an opportunity to contribute to the working of the NDA in a positive and constructive manner.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that the authority shall comprise of a chairperson and 20 ordinary members, all of whom will be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the transfer of responsibility and functions from the National Rehabilitation Board to the National Disability Authority. Section 36 makes provision with regard to the pay and conditions of service of members of staff of the authority who, immediately prior to their appointment, were serving as officers of servants of the National Rehabilitation Board. Provision is made that, save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with a recognised trade union or staff association, such persons shall not, while in the employment of the authority, receive a lesser scale of pay or be made subject to less beneficial terms and conditions of service than those to which they had been entitled. As a consequence of section 37, the Minister for Health and Children may transfer or assign thereto, property and rights enjoyed by the National Rehabilitation Board as well as liabilit<Col N="1055" /> ies incurred by the National Rehabilitation Board which have not been discharged prior to such transfer or assignment to the authority or another public body.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financial resources of the National Rehabilitation Board, Part III also deals with such issues. The resources necessary to establish the National Disability Authority will be drawn in the main from resources of the National Rehabilitation Board which will be dissolved as part of the proposed infrastructural arrangements for mainstreaming disability services. Provision for a further £2 million allocation to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been made in the Estimates for 1999.</P>
    <P>On a general level, I will analyse national and European Union policies to assist disabled people. The European Social Fund has contributed extensively to aiding the implementation of many programmes in the field of helping disabled groups in Ireland. Under the present round of European Union Structural Funds, 1994-99, Ireland has received close on £120 million to implement initiatives to help the disabled. A sum of £18 million was put aside each year under mainstream ESF moneys while £4 million has been put aside under the HORIZON employment initiative in the 1994-99 period. I am delighted that, of the £1,600 million spent under Europe on social funding during the present Community Support Framework, more than £120 million was spent <i>via</i> the National Rehabilitation Board for important innovative measures to assist disabled people.</P>
    <P>I have spoken many times regarding the analysis of how European Union Social Fund moneys will be best spent under the next round of European Union Structural Funds 2000-2006. The Minister for Finance has already stated that the following areas will be given priority funding during the forthcoming round of EU moneys after 1999: youth and long-term unemployment; the promotion of higher standards for adult literacy; assistance to early school leavers; and enhanced drug rehabilitation programmes. The Government should include assistance to disabled people and disabled groups in the national development plan which will soon be sent to the European Commission outlining our economic and social investment priorities for the seven year period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>This year alone, we will have a growth rate in the region of 10 per cent. However, the name, &ldquo;Celtic tiger of Europe&rdquo;, is not worth the paper it is written on unless appropriate policies and initiatives are put in place to help the less well off in our society. It is without question that disabled people, sadly, fall into this category. It is incumbent on all of us to implement the necessary legislation and allocate the proper resources to ensure that this policy objective is realised. I believe in equality before the law for all citizens. This is a basic constitutional right and the necessary legislation must be implemented to ensure that the <Col N="1056" /> human dignity of all the people is protected at all times.</P>
    <P>We do not want to live in a two-tier society. Disabled people do not want to live in such a society. Much progress has been made in promoting the rights of disabled people in recent years but much work remains to be done. That is where the new National Disability Authority fits into place. I look forward to working with this authority to improve the lives of disabled people. The new authority's proposals and recommendations will be taken very seriously as they are published. This Government promised it would prioritise the needs of disabled people. It has approached this matter with due diligence and setting up the National Disability Authority is part of this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Disability Authority Bill. This recognition by the Government of the needs of a section of our society which has often been neglected by State bodies and Government Departments is a welcome development. There is now a greater realisation that people with disabilities deserve at least the same facilities as others. There is also a greater awareness of the role of disabled people. However, there is still a great lack of awareness of the needs of disabled people. For example, the Department of the Environment and Local Government which has responsibility for public housing plans old people's dwellings with baths instead of shower units. Half a minute's thought would make a planner realise that a shower is much more appropriate for an old person's home than a bath. This is a small example of a Government Department spending money on facilities which lack a basic necessity for an elderly or disabled person. Local authority members are frequently asked for help by local authority tenants who wish to install shower units. They are a basic and widely felt necessity. I ask the Minister to ask the Department of the Environment and Local Government to make this item available.</P>
      <P>The object of setting up this authority is to bring together people from all walks of life to monitor the activities of Government Departments and to make recommendations. This is a welcome development but I hope this will not be the end of the matter. Will this process of consultation and recommendation become a road block to real progress? I have given one example of a Department failing to consider the needs of disabled people. Within each Department there should be a structure to ensure that when money is spent by that Department the needs of disabled people are considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who care for disabled people are an important aspect of this question. These people have raised awareness of disability in a voluntary capacity. They raise funds and give time to look after disabled people. The Minister of State should encourage carers to care for <Col N="1057" /> people by ensuring they are given the necessary financial assistance.</P>
    <P>The planning authorities should insist that granting planning permission is conditional on a public building being wheelchair accessible. Wheelchair accessible facilities should be put in place at construction stage.</P>
    <P>The Wheelchair Association in County Longford has a ten year old bus that is not completely roadworthy. I asked the Minister for Health and Children to provide funds to purchase a new bus and I also contacted the local health board about this. I hope funding will be provided to enable the association to purchase a new bus.</P>
    <P>I wish the National Disability Authority well. Its members have an important role to play and I hope all Departments will respond positively to their recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this important Bill. It will be of tremendous assistance to all disabled people. I wish the authority well.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that facilities for people with disabilities are required in many areas, but they have not been provided. Access to public transport poses a major problem for people with disabilities. The wheelchair bound find it impossible to board a bus. The Minister promised to provide a wheelchair accessible bus service, but I am sure that is a long way down the road. Continuous pressure will have to be put on him to ensure wheelchair accessible buses are provided on all bus routes. I appreciate that all buses cannot be wheelchair accessible, but a proportion of buses throughout the country should be wheelchair accessible and operate at specific times to facilitate people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>There are only a limited number of wheelchair accessible taxis operating. This has been highlighted by people with disabilities, on radio programmes and in newspaper articles. Taxi drivers claim that it costs a good deal of money to adapt a taxi to make it wheelchair accessible and the number of calls they get to transport people with disabilities are not sufficient to make it viable for them to provide a service solely for people with disabilities. A co-ordinated effort should be made. The National Disability Authority should consult taxi drivers to ensure that a sufficient number of taxis will be available to provide a service for people with disabilities. If necessary, a subvention should be given to taxi drivers who will provide such a service to ensure they can earn an adequate income.</P>
      <P>Access to trains poses a major problem to people with disabilities. It is essential that a concentrated effort should be made to address this problem. That has not happened to date. Having to cross railway bridges to gain access to platforms poses a problem not only for people with disabilities but for the elderly. This problem should also be addressed. It will be costly to address this problem of access, but wheelchair accessible facilities must be provided in railway stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> The media could play a major role in highlighting the lack of wheelchair accessible facilities in public places. I am a member of Offaly County Council which operates out of the courthouse in Tullamore, which is not wheelchair friendly. As it is virtually impossible for people with disabilities to gain access to that building, voting no longer takes place there. It is difficult for people with disabilities who wish to transact business with the county council or who have to attend court hearings to gain access to that building. A new premises is to be provided, but in the interim we must continue to put pressure on the powers that be to ensure facilities are provided in that public building for people for disabilities. As a member of that local authority, I am annoyed about the lack of adequate facilities.</P>
    <P>Hotels have made a genuine effort to provide wheelchair accessible facilities. I congratulate those who have provided wheelchair accessible toilets and other facilities. However, I am disappointed that banks and other financial institutions and shops have not provided these facilities. Banks are highly profitable organisations, but the majority of banks and buildings societies are not wheelchair accessible. A campaign should be mounted by the new authority, the media and by those who are concerned about the lack of such facilities to ensure they are provided in banks, building societies and shops. It is imperative that such facilities are provided.  The boards of the different banks should give priority to addressing this problem. I appeal to the chief executive officers in the major banks and building societies to ensure this problem is addressed.</P>
    <P>A range of areas need to be examined in the context of providing for the needs of people with disabilities, but people have to be able to gain access to services to have control over their lives. If people with disabilities are unable to gain access to services which most of us take for granted, they are being hindered in their daily lives.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable number of people with disabilities. The Irish Wheelchair Association has carried out very considerable work in this area. It has established through its research that 2,667 people do not benefit from day activity or development of any form. A startling statistic is that 1,248 of those are totally physically isolated and are effectively prisoners in their own homes.</P>
    <P>About 1,150 people required aids and appliances. I have had to make representations on occasion to the Department of Health and Children or to health boards to have aids or appliances provided. The levels of bureaucracy and delay involved are intolerable. I hope the National Disability Authority, in conjunction with the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, will be able to highlight the very frustrating delays encountered by people who apply for aids and appliances. Approximately 1,375 people also require personal assistance with basic needs, such as dressing and feeding.</P>
    <P>The intellectual disability database identified <Col N="1059" /> 26,694 people with a mental handicap or intellectual disability, which is a very large figure. We must assist those people in the future. Approximately 600 such people are receiving no services at all from the State, and approximately 22,000 are receiving some service from the State. Over 1,000 people are waiting for the provision of day care.</P>
    <P>I know a person over 85 years of age who was living alone, had a stroke and went to hospital. She found suddenly that she was going to be discharged from hospital. She had no cousins nearby, was unmarried and had lived alone all her life. She was being sent back to her own home with no one to look after her. I made representations about it and she has been provided with temporary accommodation. There is a real problem there that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There continues to be a problem for parents who are advancing in age and are caring for their mentally handicapped children. Such parents are very concerned about their sons and daughters whom they have looked after all their lives and managed to keep in their own homes. That area is not being addressed as fully and adequately as it requires. I hope this new authority will try to understand the sensitivities, worries and genuine sadness felt by many of these parents when they realise they are becoming infirm and advanced in years and that no proper provision is being made for their sons and daughters.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on looking positively at the need for an authority to deal with the whole area of disability, which has been neglected for far too long by various Governments.</P>
      <P>I am not sure the National Disability Authority will resolve many of the difficulties experienced by disabled people. We have a major problem, in that the Departments of Health and Children, the Environment and Local Government, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are all involved in looking after the disabled. There is very little co-ordination or organisation of the whole area.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister should have looked at having regional authorities rather than a national disability authority. National authorities tend to become bogged down in bureaucracy and red tape and it is very difficult for them to deal with the day to day problems encountered by the disabled. I have a vested interest in this, in that my daughter is disabled and confined to a wheelchair. Many of the difficulties encountered by such people cannot be dealt with at national level. The best people to deal with this problem on the ground are the local health boards, working in conjunction with the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who will be the members of this National Disability Authority? Will the people on the ground who are involved in working with people who suffer from disabilities be represented on the auth<Col N="1060" /> ority or will the members be officials or people who are friendly with the Minister or a Deputy? Authorities far too often comprise such people. I hope the Minister will ensure that the bodies representing those with Down's Syndrome, spina bifida and so on and those who care for the disabled will have an input into this authority.</P>
    <P>Various Governments have made efforts to deal with this issue. However, as Deputy Enright said, many of the problems that existed 20 years ago still exist today. Many of those difficulties could easily be erased by local authority planning officers, An Bord Pleanála and various agencies. There have been major developments in County Wexford over the past five years, all of which have been very welcome, with urban renewal schemes in Enniscorthy and Wexford and seaside resort status. However, when one walks the streets of Enniscorthy or Wexford one usually sees very high footpaths which are not wheelchair friendly. Most of the financial institutions, particularly building societies and credit unions, have developed new buildings over the past five or six years, none of which are wheelchair friendly. With a little thought by the planners and by the companies which spend massive amounts of money on these buildings, many of the hardships encountered by people in wheelchairs could be alleviated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, has made some efforts in this area in schools. However, the majority of primary and secondary schools do not have wheelchair accessible toilets or classrooms. For reasons best known to themselves, successive Ministers have pointedly refused to fund lifts in two and three-storey schools. Disabled students, whether they use wheelchairs, crutches or walking aids, are usually isolated in a particular classroom. The Minister for Education and Science should seriously consider making more funds available to schools to provide facilities to disabled people. Many people with disabilities may wish to attend mainstream primary and secondary schools but are prevented from doing so because of the lack of facilities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are not particularly friendly to people with disabilities either from the point of view of access or employment. I believe local authorities could do far more to employ people with disabilities. Many people with disabilities have attended second and third level education and acquired a very high level of academic qualifications, yet find it very difficult to obtain employment.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest the Minister's comments on the provision of vocational training by FÁS to people with disabilities. This is a welcome move, FÁS has largely neglected people with disabilities over the years in spite of the millions of pounds poured into it by successive Governments and has shown very little commitment to training or securing jobs for them. I hope the Minister will give FÁS a key role in this area and put pressure on <Col N="1061" /> it to become actively involved in the provision of training facilities for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal of talk about the scarcity of employees in various sectors, particularly in the hotel industry, yet hundreds of people with disabilities are still unemployed and in receipt of social welfare benefits. Perhaps a scheme could be devised by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with other Departments which would make the names of academically qualified disabled people available to various sectors of industry, including the tourism sector, in an effort to find employment for them.</P>
    <P>I find it very frightening to see so many young people who are quite capable of working being excluded from employment because of their disability. Employers seem to be afraid to take these people on but that fear must be overcome. They seem to feel that if they employ people with disabilities, they will be absent from work on a regular basis through illness and so on. That is certainly not the case in my experience. People with disabilities who work in local authorities and other sectors of industry probably have a better attendance record than able bodied men and women. They usually love their job and the independence it gives them.</P>
    <P>The issue of independence must be considered seriously. In the past, people with disabilities were not accorded the kind of status they deserved. With the advent of the centres for independent living and the vocal groups which work on their behalf, people with disabilities are fighting their case outside the gates of Dáil Éireann, local authorities and health boards. They want to live independently and be treated with the same care and attention as others in the community. In effect, they want to be treated like normal people.</P>
    <P>Centres for independent living have been set up in my constituency. People with disabilities have their own community centres, go about their daily business and provide services to the communities in which they live. The care assistants scheme &ndash; usually operated through FÁS &ndash; provides assistance to people with disabilities on a one to one basis. Such assistance should be put on a proper footing. The Minister has increased his funding allocation to the health boards and recommended that some of it should go towards the centres for independent living. However, health boards, for reasons best known to themselves, may feel it is more important to put money into other aspects of the health services. It is very difficult to persuade health boards to agree to make any substantial amount of funding available for the provision of care assistants to people with disabilities. The Minister should specify the amount of money to be allocated to centres for independent living when he is allocating funding to the health boards. People with disabilities should be facilitated to attend matches, cinemas and so on and to do all the things able bodied people do. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, has a direct interest in this area. Perhaps he would consider allocating specific funding to <Col N="1062" /> health boards for the centres for independent living or providing it directly to the centres from the Department.</P>
    <P>The issue of training must also be given serious consideration. Many people with disabilities tend to drop out of school at a young age. When they reach 16 or 17 years of age, they have no skills, training or trade. This is an area in which FÁS should become involved. It should not be difficult for FÁS to set up a register of people with disabilities in various counties through the Department of Health and Children with a view to aligning people to the type of training or trade they wish to pursue. That would provide them with a focus and an opportunity to access the workforce. Like any other section of the community, if disabled people do not have a skill or a trade, they will find it increasingly difficult to access employment.</P>
    <P>The issue of carers of people with disabilities requires serious consideration. Most of the people who look after people with disabilities in their homes do not receive any kind of carer's allowance; if they are considered for one, it is means tested. Mothers, fathers, aunts or uncles may often care for a person with a severe disability up to the age of 30 years or more, yet receive no recognition from the State. There should be an automatic entitlement to a carer's allowance for such people, be it at the same rate as the current scheme or otherwise, as they give of their time and really give up their lives to look after a son or daughter. They get very little respite or time outside the home and are on call 24 hours per day.</P>
    <P>It baffles me how a Minister, regardless of what Government is in power, could shy away from specifically examining this area. We all agree that disabled people should work and be part and parcel of the community. I would like to see that as much as possible, but we also know that there are people confined on a permanent basis to bed or to a wheelchair at home. Parents of such people should be given favourable consideration in terms of a carer's allowance regardless of means as any amount of money would not pay them for the type of care and attention they give their sons and daughters. It would cost £700 or £800 per week to keep and facilitate the son or daughter in hospital.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the authority with some reservations. Too often authorities are set up which are not really representative of the people they are supposed to look after and make recommendations for. Too often &ndash; and the current Government can be criticised as much as previous Governments &ndash; people are appointed to the authorities who do not have experience or the right qualifications. The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is directly involved in this area and has been doing tremendous work for people with disabilities. I ask her to ensure the make-up of the authority includes some of the people it is supposed to represent.</P>
    <P>I would like to see regional authorities on the <Col N="1063" /> basis of health boards or other structures, which would be more relevant and would know more about what is happening on the ground than an authority based in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I hope the authority will bring about the necessary improvements for the disabled in our communities, that it will lead to the majority of disabled who want to secure jobs being able to do so, that it will ensure the disabled will be able to move independently about their communities and not have to surmount the different obstructions which are currently in their way, including lack of access to financial institutions and local authorities, inaccessible footpaths, etc. I hope all these issues will be seriously examined with a view to improving the quality of life for the disabled.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it is estimated that 360,000 people, or 10 per cent of the population, have a disability and that 40 per cent of these are of a working age. Yet statistics show that only 3 per cent of these people are working. The first duty of the authority should be the organisation of discussions with employers across a broad section of society to ensure that as many of those who want to work can enter employment as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly, I welcome this initiative. As a nation we are coming of age when we consider people who are challenged in different ways. It is important that we have a wide-ranging debate on this issue, because for too long people who are challenged in different ways have been stigmatised.</P>
      <P>I have a problem with the Title of the Bill and I ask that it be re-examined. Are we again labelling people who are challenged by calling this the National Disability Authority? Is it a negative title? Should it not be called the national authority for challenged people? Maybe I am being politically correct and splitting hairs, but it is an important issue. Talking about people who are challenged in different ways automatically draws into the net a whole range of people who have been called &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; up to this. In our coming of age perhaps it is necessary to move away from the thinking associated with &ldquo;disability&rdquo;, a term which is patronising and in some ways ignores the fantastic gifts of many of these people. Who can say whether any of us is not in some way challenged? We are all challenged and perhaps in this context the Title should be examined.</P>
      <P>I raise this because of the importance of equality. If we think of everybody as being challenged in different ways and of some people as being more challenged than others, we can encompass much more and can change the psyche of the nation, something which is most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many people are aware of this very important initiative being undertaken by the Minister and which has the backing of almost everybody? I challenge the Minister to make this initiative more widely known. In examining the Bill and the range of different agencies involved, <Col N="1064" /> I noticed there seems to be a problem in disseminating information to those who need it about the services and support which is available. I hope this is something the authority will take on board when it begins examining its remit.</P>
    <P>There are people who do not know their rights or what they can avail of from the State, local agencies, etc. We must push out the boat much more in terms of making information available. I would like the Minister to incorporate this in the Bill in some manner, perhaps by providing that the authority will have the statutory function of widely disseminating information and raising the national consciousness regarding the difficulties many of our citizens encounter because they are challenged in different ways. I recommend that some kind of information line be set up for those who are challenged. Perhaps one already exists, but if it does I and many others are not aware of it. There must be easy access to information. I am also somewhat concerned by the issue of appeals.</P>
    <P>If I am reading it correctly, the authority can recommend to the Minister that funding be reduced or withdrawn from certain bodies if they do not comply with what they are supposed to do. Has the Minister looked at the notion of a mediation body, even as part of the authority, so a mediator would be available if somebody who is challenged encounters a difficulty instead of having to go to court or making a major issue? The mediator could discreetly, confidentially and professionally intervene and mediate between the bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that such a mediation programme exists in America and seems to work quite well. Perhaps it is something at which we could look and which the authority will recommend in time. It might be a role which the authority could take on board. We have seen sad high profile court cases and if we had a mediation service <i>in situ</i>, such expense, trauma and confrontation might be unnecessary. It is something the Minister might consider, although I am sure she has already.</P>
    <P>Many people are challenged in various ways &ndash; I want to try to continue to use that language because it is better than going down the other route &ndash; and have severe difficulties. I would like to highlight one or two areas which may not have been highlighted by colleagues. We are aware that people are living longer and, because of that, many of our citizens are afflicted with the awful difficulty of Alzheimer's disease, which is a growing problem. I use this opportunity to highlight this major issue because I am aware of a number of groups interested in setting up centres to assist people suffering from this terrible difficulty. Will the Minister let me know &ndash; maybe she would write to me &ndash; if there is any assistance available to private individuals who wish to set up day care centres, for instance, or residential centres on a private basis for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease? I would be very interested in that.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has been getting a certain <Col N="1065" /> amount of press coverage recently is the growing problem of autism and autistic children, and I commend the efforts people are making in this area. I have stressed from time to time the importance of early intervention. Everyone will agree that this is a difficulty which challenges people but if there is intervention prior to pre-school level, studies have shown dramatic improvements can occur and that these people, instead of being challenged by this difficulty all their lives, can lead a normal life. I also refer to three other learning problems &ndash; attention deficit disorder, dyslexia and dysphasia. Those suffering from learning problems are perhaps seen to be on the fringes in terms of people who are challenged, but they are very real difficulties for a growing number of people.</P>
    <P>Until now religious orders and voluntary groups have taken on the task and the burden &ndash;  if &ldquo;burden&rdquo; is the correct word because for many it has been a vocation and blessing &ndash; of looking after people who are challenged in different ways. There has, however, been a decline in the numbers in those orders. I pay tribute to people in those orders who have been doing fantastic work for decades. Unfortunately, many of them have been getting bad press recently because of the misdemeanours and serious crimes of a small number of their colleagues. We must not forget much of the work many of these religious orders have been doing.</P>
    <P>I am aware that staff working in some centres run by orders are not paid at the same rate as staff doing similar work employed by State agencies. Is that because of a lack of funding to these orders? It is a serious issue which could result in a certain amount of disquiet and dispute. The Minister would agree with me that it is the last thing we need. I would appreciate if she would let me know the situation, although she may have no responsibility in this area. I would hate to see problems develop.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker spoke about great care being taken as regards membership of the authority being set up, with which I concur. We must have people on the authority who are experienced, knowledgeable and in touch with what is happening. It is an important area about which we must be careful.</P>
    <P>Access to and facilities in building seem to cause problems for those who are either physically or, in some cases, mentally challenged. It is important certain codes are set down and that State buildings being constructed from now on and business and commercial facilities comply with those codes in terms of accessibility and so on. Many modern buildings, such as hotels, are complying and are working hard to provide suitable accommodation for people who are challenged in various ways. We must ensure, for instance, that cinemas provide assisted listening systems so that people who are hard of hearing or challenged other ways can hear the screenplay. It is important toilet facilities in hotels, restaurants and so on are accessible. If a citizen <Col N="1066" /> encounters difficulties as regards accessibility, it would be better to have a mediation service in place rather than having to go to court.</P>
    <P>It is important we raise national awareness, which the Minister is endeavouring to do, that we see ourselves as coming of age in this area as we move into the new millennium, that we recognise people are challenged in different ways, that we treat it in a positive rather than negative fashion, that we encourage rather than discourage and that we include rather than exclude. The language we use is very important. The title of this Bill is perhaps a little dated because it uses the word &ldquo;disability&rdquo;. There is a problem with labelling and keeping us in the 20th century rather than moving into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the importance of mediation, an information line and disseminating information on people's rights so they know what is available and how to redress wrongs if necessary. We want to integrate people who are physically and mentally challenged.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker expressed concern that the authority would be centralised. It is important, at the very least, to regionalise the authority as those who are challenged often find it difficult to travel. I am sure this will not happen, but rather than sitting in an office in Dublin, members of the authority must reach out to every home in which there is a person who is challenged. The authority should also establish regional offices or some other forum through which information can be received and disseminated.</P>
    <P>The authority may not have real teeth; it is a policy-making and an advisory body. I am concerned about delays. I am sure the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the authority will devise policy and advise the Minister who, it is hoped will act on that advice. Is there some mechanism through which the authority could intervene between parties at an early stage if a problem exists rather than having to go to the Minister who would then have to take out the stick to sort out things? We know where that can lead. We need to give the authority more teeth so it can take action, initially at a low level of mediation, and later at a more formal level, rather than always having to refer back to the Department and the Minister. If all else fails, it is important that the Minister can take action, but that should be a last resort. The authority seems to lack that bite as a think-tank and an advisory body. As a result, it might not be taken seriously. It would have more teeth if it could mediate and if such mediation were binding on those involved in a dispute? However, that may be a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State on this Bill. We all want as many resources as possible devoted to this area. I am not being critical of the Minister of State as she has done much work in this area, but a lot more needs to be done. I am sure she will agree we are only starting on this issue. However, we are coming of age and it is <Col N="1067" /> good that we are moving in the right direction as we enter the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the complex issue of disability and I compliment the Minister of State on her work since taking office. As a new Deputy, I am impressed by her dedication and commitment to the task and to the complex nature of dealing with, and providing for, those with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I hope membership of the National Disability Authority will reflect the body of agencies and the sector with which it is attempting to deal and initiate policy for. I would not like it to become a centrally located office nor do I want it regionalised. There is a need for less, not more, bureaucracy in the area of care. The authority should have more powers to deal with the many problems with which it will be confronted. Given that this is a complex area, it will come into contact with all the State agencies, Departments and local authorities. Its members will need the willpower, strength and authority to deal with the many problems they will encounter, particularly in the early days.</P>
      <P>I hope the new authority will examine every State agency, including local authorities. Although I hope it will not be organised on a regional or county basis, I hope it will visit all offices and agencies who operate in this area. Such an exercise will reveal that this area has been overlooked, even though it has been spoken about for many years.</P>
      <P>I hope the authority will ensure the written commitment given to this area is delivered on in a tangible way which affects the lives of people with disabilities. There is no doubt it will see the need for expanding the Government fund and ensuring there is sufficient resources to deal with every demand.</P>
      <P>I have served on a local authority for 20 years and I have seen many changes in the area of disability. It is now more recognised and given greater priority. Funding has been increased by successive Governments and there has been a change of attitude, priority and funding on the part of health boards. We have also seen changes in building regulations. However, despite all the developments in recent years, there is a need for enormous and ongoing change to integrate the disability sector. The Minister of State calls this mainstreaming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers the various schemes and funding that are in place and operated by the health boards or local government, there is a need to examine the idea of a passport for life. This would mean that a disabled person is identified following an examination by the authorities as requiring certain assistance or an extension to their home, etc. It should only be necessary to undergo this process once or perhaps every few years. This would eliminate from the system the annoyance for people of having to complete numerous forms to obtain even the minimum <Col N="1068" /> amount of assistance from the State or local government.</P>
    <P>To make mainstreaming a reality, the valid suggestion put forward by Deputy Stanton in relation to identifying the Bill as a measure for those who are challenged in the community should be examined. A fundamental change must take place in our attitude to people who are disabled. If we take the road suggested by Deputy Stanton, our language and approach to this area must change.</P>
    <P>If mainstreaming is to become a reality, a measure of our maturing society will be how well we look after the weaker members of the community. Up to now, it has been only a reasonable exercise. Much more must be done. The Minister of State said 360,000 people, or 10 per cent of the population, are disabled. At many meetings I attend the complaint is that these people feel they are outside their community and the mainstream activities in which able bodied people are involved. This is unacceptable in today's world. The exercise of mainstreaming must be carried out efficiently and speedily. It must be properly funded and driven by the authority. This demands that the authority have certain powers and funding conditions.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have much responsibility in this area. I said earlier that this matter is complex and will involve every Department. In the context of local authority housing and the demands on it, if we are to bring in disabled people from the margins, there is a need to ensure that there is capacity in the local authority housing stock in the future to take on families which include a disabled person. They must be catered for properly in new housing.</P>
    <P>In terms of the old housing stock, the process should be more efficient if an application is made for an extension to a house or a physical aid for a disabled person. It must deliver the facility required much more quickly to the disabled person. Too many people on the current housing lists are battling in the marketplace with the local authority to purchase a house and convert it to their needs. They are unable to buy a house because of the cost and the local authority cannot assist them. As a result, these people are left in their current accommodation without the proper facilities to cater for their needs. I have experience in that regard. I am aware of cases on the housing lists in Kilkenny and Carlow and if the problem exists there, it must exist in every other county and constituency.</P>
    <P>The new building regulations are highly regarded but they are not working in general. They may work in major complexes and make a token gesture towards disabled people, for example, a disabled driver using a car park. However, in the renovation of buildings, the legal requirements in relation to facilities for disabled people are often ignored. I am aware of new buildings which have toilets for the disabled in restaurants, but there are steps outside the main door. I do not understand how this constitutes <Col N="1069" /> access for disabled people under the building regulations.</P>
    <P>This relates to the argument made by the planning authorities that they do not have the funding to police every case where planning permission is granted and a development takes place. This is not good enough and action must be taken to ensure not only that the building regulations are met in the context of the planning process, but also in terms of the completed building.</P>
    <P>This also applies to swimming pools. There is a public pool in my constituency and there are little or no facilities to enable disabled people to use it. More funds must be made available through the local authorities to ensure that such buildings are updated to allow disabled members of the community free and independent access.</P>
    <P>Access to public buildings is another major issue. I am aware from my experience that disabled people cannot access the Kilkenny Corporation building. This also relates to funding. If the sins of the past are to be corrected, substantial funds must be made available to local authorities which find that they can only deliver a service to the able bodied sections of their communities since disabled people cannot access the buildings. If a disabled member of the public cannot access a poorly planned local authority building, how can the authority offer that person a job? It cannot be done unless the disabled person endures great pain because he or she cannot independently access the building. This relates to planning, the funding mechanism which exists and the sins of the past.</P>
    <P>If the disability authority is to move matters forward, stock must be taken of the current position with regard to public buildings, local authority housing schemes and facilities such as swimming pools. Even in the current structure, where we are reaching out and helping people to provide for themselves at home, the waiting time for the provision of extensions to houses to accommodate disabled people is too long. I know of cases where young persons have almost lived their lives at school, not having proper facilities in their own homes simply because they were waiting for funding or for a builder, in conjunction with the local authority, to provide them. That is not good enough. I hope funding in this area is not being eaten up by bureaucracy, but I fear it is. My fear is that the money allocated by successive Governments amounts to very little after it has washed through the system because it is being eaten into by the bureaucratic process.</P>
    <P>If disabled persons are to be accommodated in the workplace, employers have to be given an incentive to enable them to comply with the building regulations and make the workplace accessible for disabled persons to participate fully in the workings of commercial enterprises. Not enough is being done in this area. If we were to carry out an analysis, I believe we would find that employers are ready and willing, if the Government will co-operate with them, to employ those who are disabled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> Given that development in the commercial world and in our own lives is being driven by the information age, that there is a Government policy on e-commerce and a drive to put computers and technology into our schools, surely it is time FÁS embarked on a different type of educational process to ensure that people who are disabled at home can participate in the workforce without having to leave their homes. They should be able to avail of FÁS courses through the use of information technology at home, apply for jobs from their home and become involved, at a distance, in companies in their community. Technology has reduced reliance on having people in the workplace. It is possible for them to work from home, and e-commerce and information technology is the way to do this. We have failed miserably as a society to give disabled people real places in the workplace. The figures are shocking. The efforts of the Government to involve the disabled detail how jobs can be made available, but there is a falling down between completing a course and filling a job. That should be addressed to enable disabled people to enter the workforce.</P>
    <P>The late Dr. Peter Birch of the Diocese of Ossory, which is in my constituency, asked who will care for the carers when he was running many radical programmes in Kilkenny. There is a need to care for carers, to ensure that they are constantly up-skilled to cope with life with a disabled person and to move on any programme the Government puts in place. I appeal to the Government to properly fund people who become disabled later in life. I was involved in the Motorneuron Society because my late mother died from motorneuron disease. There is a need to recognise the input of a family in that circumstance who are faced with a disabled person later in life and do not know how to cope. There is a need for communication about care and the up-skilling of carers in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister of State on bringing it forward. Certain measures it contains will be useful in the future. FÁS is taking over certain functions, and this is important because in the past there was a tendency to isolate people with a disability. There are efforts now to integrate them in the community. In my area in Limerick the Brothers of Charity do tremendous work running houses where disabled blend in with the community. We need to have the same approach to training. Over 20 years ago, when I was involved in apprenticeship training in AnCO, the organisation which preceded FÁS, I was conscious of the number of people who obtained places in the furniture, woodwork and upholstery industries who had previously been with the National Rehabilitation Board and who worked successfully in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Private Members' motion, put forward by Fine Gael on 1 December last, looking for £21 million in funding for the this sector, was turned down by the Government. It is <Col N="1071" /> very hard to reconcile that with the fact that because of the concern of bookmakers about people betting on the Isle of Man we introduced what I would describe as a gamblers' charter at a cost of £24 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and I are conscious of the fact that in the mid-western region there is a very powerful group who, over the years, have constantly reminded us how we neglect people with a disability. Ger South and the other people involved remind us annually of the difficulties in our own area and the number of people who are awaiting long-term and day care. Bob Sillery, the head of the Brothers of Charity, speaks of the long waiting lists, the difficulties caused by financial constraints and the small numbers they can accommodate annually. Everybody is talking about the Celtic tiger, but the Celtic tiger is only purring when it comes to people with a disability and with regard to the finance that is required. My colleague, Deputy Stanton, rightly asked where we would be without the Brothers of Charity and the other people who have taken an interest in people with a disability and who are to be applauded for that.</P>
    <P>We have been talking for a long time about targets for the public service. I understand the standard is 3 per cent. I am not sure whether that is a mandatory standard but one finds that it is exceeded in certain local authorities and not reached in others. Health boards and local authorities need a very strong reminder from the Department of the Taoiseach to make this a mandatory 3 per cent. It would be interesting to look at the statistics to see whether different health boards and councils are meeting the target. We should not have to have a standard of 3 per cent. In my own local authority people with a disability have worked as part of the workforce, have been accepted and have done an excellent job. It is right that this should be so. It is regrettable that a 3 per cent guideline has been mentioned. If such a guideline exists, people working in local authorities and health boards should be notified and it should be enforced.</P>
    <P>Our consciousness must be awakened in terms of people with disabilities. People work extremely hard in all our communities to provide facilities for people with disabilities. Newcastlewest is a carbon copy of other towns, where people are involved in improving the local infrastructure and providing basic essentials, such as footpaths and entrances to public buildings, for people with disabilities. It is interesting that, as we approach the millennium, serious deficiencies still exist in this area.</P>
    <P>If it were not for FÁS schemes, local authorities would not able to make footpaths wheelchair friendly, but this work has not been completed. Most towns designate parking spaces for people with disabilities, but able bodied citizens frequently park in them. I often wonder whether the rigours of the law are enforced in terms of fines, etc. It is unfair that this should not happen; <Col N="1072" /> it negates a great deal of the good work carried out by groups such as Access. Many financial institutions are housed in fine buildings, but how many of them even attempt to make them wheelchair friendly?</P>
    <P>It is sad that in order to raise public awareness of what needs to be done, people such as John Doyle, who is an excellent spokesman, must go on <i>The Pat Kenny Show</i> or picket outside Heuston Station for two nights to highlight the lack of wheelchair friendly public transport. Society must grow up and become more friendly towards people with disabilities. There are 26,000 people in the intellectual database for people with physical and mental handicaps. That figure should not be daunting and these people should be treated individually.</P>
    <P>I recently spoke to a person involved in the Brothers of Charity who indicated that people were trying to gain access to their facilities for full-time attention. There was also a case recently where local gardaí had to break into a house owned by an elderly woman who had a mentally handicapped daughter. It transpired that the woman had been dead for a number of days and her daughter was not even aware of what was happening. She had to be admitted to an institution immediately; but it is sad it had come to this. Many elderly people look after people with disabilities and they often bear the burden on their own. They probably receive the minimum in respite care. It is sad, given the manner in which Ireland has progressed, that this is the case.</P>
    <P>The scope of the problem must be examined if we are to respond effectively, and the finance required to deal with this issue must be provided. The people of Newcastlewest will hold more meetings with Ger South and his group. They will be informed about the requirements, financial and otherwise, needed to resolve the difficulties which exist for people who need full-time care. It is time we responded.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to attention deficit disorder and dyslexia. There is an excellent school for dyslexia sufferers in Newcastlewest, but the State gives it scant recognition. Usually, the State's response is that dyslexia is covered under remedial services. Remedial teachers often cover four or five schools and cater for approximately 40 pupils which results in them having to race from school to school. People who set up facilities for dyslexia sufferers should be encouraged by the Department of Education and Science because their efforts are worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Attention deficit disorder has been highlighted only in recent years. I thank those who brought it to the attention of public representatives and pointed out the inadequacies of the system in terms of responding to it. Alice Cushnahan, wife of John Cushnahan, MEP, is to the fore in Limerick in making people aware of what is required. Cheshire homes do tremendous work; there is one in Rathfredagh, Newcastlewest. There was an imbalance in the pay structure of those working there, but it was redressed, which was important <Col N="1073" /> because it restored goodwill. We are moving in the right direction, but a great deal needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that I am being parochial, but the situation is similar in most other communities. I recently met a group in Newcastlewest which, as a result of funding under the Leader programme, commissioned a feasibility study on a multi-resource centre for the town. It was initiated by people who were involved in the disability field. A worthwhile proposal resulted and it is anticipated that phase 1 of the proposal will cost £700,000, which is not a daunting figure. We should try to encourage and develop such centres in most communities to cater not alone for people with disabilities, but the elderly, who need day care facilities, and young people. Newcastlewest, as is the case in many provincial towns, does not have adequate facilities for young people or the elderly, although there have been improvements in services for the elderly in recent times. Essential facilities, such as hydrotherapy pools and fitness centres, are needed to cater for everybody.</P>
    <P>If the concept of multi-resource centres were developed, it would help the fusion of all age groups in the community, which is extremely important. Gone are the days when people with disabilities were treated condescendingly and given a pat on the back after they explained their situation. They must be respected and public consciousness has been awakened. However, a great deal more needs to be done. We, as politicians, must hang our heads in shame and question whether we have responded quickly enough to the problems of people with disabilities. I am not sure we have, but the Bill is positive.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has had discussions with those who worked for the National Rehabilitation Board, which is being dissolved, to make sure there is not a repeat of the recent unseemly dispute over staff and wage structures, which occurred after the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment amalgamated a number of statutory bodies. I hope there will not be difficulties with the staff who have done an excellent job over the years moving to the new authority.</P>
    <P>The organisations which have been to the forefront in this area over the years must be congratulated. The National Rehabilitation Board is well known for the great work it has done over many years. If it had not taken the initiative, one can imagine the vacuum which would probably otherwise exist. It is important we give it the attention and the financial encouragement to continue its good work.</P>
    <P>Another important area of concern which might be addressed is the provision by the NRB of training courses for people with disabilities being taken over by FÁS. It is also important that, where a person with a disability gains employment, there should not be a two tiered payment system and disabled people should be recognised on their merits. Whatever salary is payable, it should be paid accordingly.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State who is doing <Col N="1074" /> her best. It is important to have a Minister focused on this area and this is a step in the right direction. The authority will not be a service provider but it has certain important functions, for example, research. There have been many reminders to women to use folic acid during pregnancy to prevent spina bifida. That encapsulates for me the importance of the research function in ensuring that research results in people taking preventative measures. Senator Henry mentioned in the Seanad that folic acid could have been incorporated with flour, but that there was a European Union problem with that. That is one example of where the research function is relevant and it will be important for the future. It is to be hoped that awareness of disability has been raised and that, with funding for the new authority, further progress can be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support the Bill which provides for the establishment of the National Disability Authority on a statutory basis. The NDA will take on responsibility for the policy development and implementation of new standards in services to, supports for and entitlement of people with disabilities. Anyone with a mild, moderate or profound disability must have rights, opportunities and benefits similar to anyone else. The programme for Government clearly spells out that disability is one of the most important social issues facing society. We have paid lip service for too long to the estimated 360,000 people with a disability in assisting them assert their rights.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the various expert groups which reported to Government with proposals which assisted in putting the National Disability Authority in place. The Government commissioned reports such as Towards an Independent Future, A Strategy for Equality and Building a Future Together. These have clearly and comprehensively set out how the rights of people with disabilities might be addressed. The achievement of this Fianna Fáil-led administration since coming into office underlines the depth of our commitment to securing the rights of those with disabilities and we have acted on the studies which clearly point the way forward.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the recent legislative changes with the revamped Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Bill. Most important is the huge additional funding invested and allocated. Major progress has been made in delivering on the recommendations and commitments across the board, especially in the mainstreaming of training and employment of people with disabilities. The Government is clearly delivering for those with disabilities in a fashion which far outstrips the efforts of previous Administrations, and seems to be determined to continue on this path in a vigorous and focused fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay a special tribute to the person who is vigorously driving and focusing that commitment and determination, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace. I congratulate her on taking up the torch on this issue and running with it when she was not in a position to deliver. While in <Col N="1075" /> opposition, she consulted, listened and put together the necessary ingredients to formulate a policy. When she had the opportunity as Minister of State, she delivered on her commitments. A special tribute is due to the Minister of State and I take this opportunity to pay it.</P>
    <P>I have witnessed service developments in the Eastern Health Board, and I salute all those involved in the provision of services for their commitment and dedication. I have taken time to visit some of the locations in which services are provided. I am not sure I would have the commitment or find it in myself to treat it as a job if I were required to provide services for people with profound disabilities. Those involved in the provision of services do not treat it as a job. They are caring dedicated individuals who are not involved in the provision of services for the reward or salary payable. It is important to acknowledge the huge commitment of people who go well beyond their job description and spend many additional hours working because of the befriending required by their job and the service they provide. I am sure every Member will acknowledge that there is great befriending in the care of those with profound disabilities which goes well beyond the duties of the people involved. It important we acknowledge the commitment and dedication of those who provide services, either care or administrative, across the board to people with mild, moderate or profound disabilities.</P>
    <P>I especially compliment those involved in the Eastern Health Board services. I am aware of the level of commitment and the huge developments in the area. We have put forward a service plan for 1999 of services for people with disabilities. The components of a comprehensive mental health service include, early childhood assessment and early intervention, a child education and development centre, home support and pre-school for those with an intellectual disability.</P>
    <P>When I brought my child to school, I was concerned about where he would sit in the classroom and who might befriend him. My wife and I took it in turns to bring him to school. After two or three weeks we considered how he was adapting and decided that he had settled well. There was a Down's syndrome child in the classroom and my child reacted as if this was normal. I contrast this with my own experience in my early days in national school. Children with a handicap were placed in special schools to which they were brought in a minibus with the name of the school written on the side. It is a source of great joy that my son is sharing a classroom with a child with a disability and adapting to it.</P>
    <P>There are two members of the one family in wheelchairs attending the same school as my older son. The principal brought it to my attention that because the family has only recently moved into the parish the school had to pick up the tab for the necessary alterations from the parish fund. Ramps had to be provided and doors widened. While the school was happy to accommodate the children concerned, one can appreci<Col N="1076" /> ate the difficulties this caused for it. Mainstreaming in education, of which I am in favour will have huge benefits.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board special high support day services are available. Those accommodated in vocational training schedules in sheltered workshops should subsequently be placed in sheltered employment. A number have fallen out of the system. This is frustrating for the individual concerned and his or her parents. Consideration should be given to the provision of a safety net.</P>

      <P>It far exceeds anything provided previously. Earlier in the year the Deputy's party sought an additional £21 million for people with disabilities. A total of £24 million has been allocated for persons with a learning disability and £12.4 million for persons with a physical disability giving a total of £36.4 million. It is important to say that this £36.4 million is additional money allocated on top of all of the other moneys which are being spent. If one wants to make comparisons, I will be happy to do so.</P>

      <P>I accept that.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Eastern Health Board is involved in the provision of community therapy, income support schemes and various community services programmes for people with a physical and sensory disability; that the community-based services are being expanded; and that there is a focus on one particularly area which I am pursuing, that is speech and language therapy, where I understand the difficulties arise from the availability of professional support staff required in that area. The other area is occupational therapy and physiotherapy. There are problems in the community and the Minister is aware of them. It is not simply a case of being able to throw money at them but that we should be putting in place the appropriate measures required to ensure we will be able to provide as soon as possible the necessary professional staff which are identified as required currently and downstream in the services because it is impinging on the other work which we are achieving in the community.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the worthy and merited focus on respite care. It is important to ensure that the necessary respite, whether it be a week or fortnight in the year or every weekend, be provided to those who are able to accommodate people with a disability and require a break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of residential accommodation, I welcome the fact that we are moving positively in the area of independent living units and high support residential facilities. I am proud of the fact that, as chairman of the Eastern Health Board, I opened a number of high support residential facilities. Many people would say that people support these facilities when they are not <Col N="1078" /> in their own back yard. I am pleased to say that I live on St. Lawrence Road and I opened an extensive high support hostel there for people with a disability. It has proved to be a success to date. The cutting of a tape or opening of a door does not integrate people in society, however, and I am not sure whether we have tapped this success to achieve what is really necessary to ensure appropriate integration of people in society. Having personal first-hand experience of this, I know there is a great deal more to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The services being provided by the Eastern Health Board for persons with a physical and sensory disability are designed to enhance the principle of health and social gain set down in the national health strategy. Services are intended to facilitate the fullest possible participation by the client in social, cultural, educational and vocational activities and are in keeping with the Eastern Health Board's general policy of ensuring that, as far as possible, clients are assisted to live with comfort, dignity and independence within their community and an appropriate residential setting is provided where a community setting is suitable.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of issues on which I want to touch briefly. Recently there was coverage of Deputy Mitchell's case regarding a blind individual who tried to benefit under the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concession) Regulations. If anybody wants to know the boxes in the first primary medical certificate which must be ticked off by the area medical health officer, both Minister Mary Wallace and I know them because we raised this issue at the parliamentary party and with the Minister for Finance. It is a simple matter. The Revenue Commissioners need to agree that an additional box be put in place so that the primary certificates required to benefit under the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concession) Regulations can be ticked by the medical officer and the criteria in the other boxes need not be met. Although I do not know the case, I gather that the particular individual is blind but has the use of his limbs. Those of us who are familiar with the certificates will clearly acknowledge that he, like many others, should be able to avail of this scheme. I am frustrated when I come across a stroke victim who has lost the power of one side of the body and is unable to avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I conclude by congratulating some organisations which are active in my community, in particular the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Central Remedial Clinic. I pay tribute to Pat and Nuala Matthews of the Irish Society for Autism. Much good work would not have been carried out by the statutory authorities without the drive and force of people like Pat and Nuala Matthews, Lady Valerie Goulding of the Central Remedial Clinic and the personnel behind the Irish Wheelchair Association. I wish everybody in the NDA, which will be the engine room and power house of people with disabilities, every success in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ó Caoláin and Higgins.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives the impression that the Government is tackling the problem of disability. While I welcome the Bill in many respects, successive Governments have fallen far short of granting full rights of participation in society to those with a disability.</P>
      <P>Discrimination continues and it can be seen even here in Leinster House. I want to look at the simple yet fundamental problem of access. Recently a group of ten guests of mine from all over the country who are wheelchair bound were denied the simple pleasures of a Dáil tour. They were confined to the atrium and the Gallery and could not gain access to the Seanad Chamber, the Ceann Comhairle's office and the nice view of Leinster Lawn. To their great credit, the ushers explained the history of Leinster House to them as they gazed up at the pictures of Michael Collins and Cathal Brugha and the 1916 Proclamation. I wondered was this the sort of Republic for which Collins and Brugha would have wished because we still have real inequality when it comes to those who suffer from disabilities.</P>
      <P>Surely we should be leading by example. It is shameful that Leinster House, the seat of Government, is not fully wheelchair accessible. I readily understand the real anger of those in the Forum of People with Disabilities at the lack of action by successive Governments on this important issue.</P>
      <P>Section M of the building regulations is not being enforced. This section requires that all new buildings since 1991 be accessible to those with disabilities. Eight years on, nothing much has happened. This statutory regulation is being ignored by the builders, who are becoming very rich during the Celtic tiger boom, while those suffering from a disability are being ignored. Unfortunately, the Government is sitting back and allowing this to happen. This problem must be urgently addressed and I would like the Minister to refer to it in her reply. Ultimately it is a problem for the Department of the Environment and Local Government to address.</P>
      <P>The problem is not just about access to buildings or external venues like parks and beaches. Access to beaches is a problem that could be solved quickly. It just requires the political will. Access is also about human rights because if people with disabilities do not have access they are being denied the fundamental rights all of us cherish and take for granted &ndash; the right to travel freely, the right to health care, housing, education and proper communications, the right to benefit from the information society and the right to express one's sexuality.</P>
      <P>When we deny access &ndash; and studies have been carried out on this &ndash; people may become impoverished. A study carried out by the Forum of People with Disabilities found that those who suffer from disabilities also experience financial difficulties. That is an issue about which all of us in this House should be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> One statistic highlighted in that study is that in approximately 45 per cent of households headed by a person with a disability, income is only half of the average household income. That is a startling indictment of the way this House has tackled this serious problem. I agree with Deputy Barnes that we are not trying to make political points. This issue involves all of us and we need to reach a consensus on it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the financial rights of those with a disability, the &ldquo;not for profit business association&rdquo; was established comprising 135,000 citizens from various umbrella organisations such as the National Training and Development Institute, Rehab, Care, etc. The Minister for Finance should recognise the major role that association can play in the development of our economy.</P>
    <P>While I welcome many aspects of the Bill we must go much further on this important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the establishment of the National Disability Authority. This is an important milestone on the journey to full equality for the estimated 10 per cent of our population who have a disability.</P>
      <P>The guiding principles in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities were equality, maximising participation, enabling independence and choice through a social model of disability.</P>
      <P>Recently, a person with a disability had to engage in a public protest in Dublin to highlight the failure of Bus Átha Cliath to provide accessible buses in its new fleet. The same story can be told throughout the country. One of the central tasks of the new authority, therefore, must be to ensure, through enforcement of existing legislation and recommending further legislation, that all public places including Government, local authority, commercial and other premises are fully accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Building regulations were mentioned. This is an important point. How many of the numerous new buildings going up around the country in this current economic boom are fully accessible to the disabled? The authority must ensure that all sectors of our society carry out their own disability audits so that the principle of equality is firmly established not only in people's minds but in every practical way possible.</P>
      <P>I share the concern of other speakers that the legislation as framed is not sufficiently strong. We need a National Disability Authority that is truly dynamic and which has the clout to deliver for all those with disabilities. It must have the ability to root out all the old attitudes and practices whereby those with disabilities have been discriminated against and, if not the victims of overt discrimination, have been patronised and undervalued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that I acknowledge the tremendous contribution of countless thousands of people who, through their commitment, dedication and energy have built up vibrant voluntary <Col N="1081" /> sector support groups covering all aspects of disability. There is a great debt of gratitude due these good people for their labours.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and will support amendments which strengthen it. I look forward to seeing our fellow citizens with disabilities taking their rightful place in the centre of life.</P>

        <b>: </b>I welcome the idea of the National Disability Authority which will be involved in the provision of a service and advise on policy for people with disabilities. I have serious reservations, however, about proceeding with the Bill before the Bill providing for the setting up of Comhairle is published and debated in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board, which has played a major role in providing services to people with disabilities, is being stood down and its functions transferred to a range of other bodies including the National Social Services Board. The National Disability Authority is another feature of that. A more integrated approach to enable a better debate on this issue should have been taken. The new provisions in these Bills should have been published at the same time as this Bill so that we could have an overall view of what was being proposed in regard to services for people with disabilities. That would have been a more preferable way to proceed.</P>
      <P>How much real consultation took place between the Minister and individuals and organisations representing people with disabilities on what is a major restructuring of the services for people with disabilities? What is the nature of the consultations that have taken place in this regard? Are the organisations representing people with disabilities fully satisfied with the way matters are being progressed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Combat Poverty figures to which the Deputy refers relate to figures published by the statistical office of the EU, EUROSTAT, in May 1997. The figures, based on data drawn from the European Community household panel, found that in 1993, 28 per cent of children in Ireland lived in households whose <Col N="1082" /> income was below 50 per cent of average net household income.</P>
      <P>The incidence of child poverty is a major concern of this Government and successive budget measures, along with targeted policy initiatives, have sought to ensure that our children are protected and given the opportunities to break an intergenerational cycle of poverty.</P>
      <P>One of the means by which child poverty can be tackled effectively is child benefit. The link between the risk of poverty and family size has been firmly established and my Department's provision of income support in respect of children plays a crucial role in combating the incidence of child poverty. Child benefit channels resources directly to families and is of particular importance to families on low incomes. As it is universal, not taxable and not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages. It is further complemented by programmes in other Departments aimed at combating disadvantage among children, for example, the Department of Education and Science's Early Start and Breaking the Cycle initiatives and the Children at Risk initiative in the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>A key factor in combating the incidence of poverty, and child poverty in particular, relates to the adequacy of the payments made under the various schemes. Increases in last December's budget mean that all social welfare payments have now reached or in many cases have exceeded the minimum level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. In addition, increases to the monthly rates of child benefit in recent budgets have established its growing importance within the overall child income support system with a particular focus on the needs of larger families.</P>
      <P>The recent budget provided for child benefit increases of £3 per month to £34.50 for each of the first two children and £4 per month to £46 for the third and all subsequent children. Some 513,000 families with a total of 1.2 million children will benefit from these increases. The full year cost of these increases in last December's budget is £40.76 million and the total projected spend on child benefit in 1999 is £447.5 million compared to a total spend of £231.3 million in 1993, the year the EUROSTAT study was conducted. In addition, the 1999 budget provided for an increase in the family income supplement threshold of £8 per week which, allied to last year's introduction of FIS calculated on a net income basis, means that thousands of families are better off as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Critical decisions will continue to be required in setting a policy course for the future development of child income support. The application of substantial resources in recent years towards the provision of increases in child benefit represents a tangible move towards removing disincentive effects and encouraging a move into employment <Col N="1083" /> which is a key step in addressing overall poverty. The reform of FIS represents another equally important step.</P>
    <P>In summary, I assure the Deputy of this Government's continued support for increases in family support payments generally and our overall commitment to a families first policy and to services benefiting children, particularly those in poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will briefly raise one aspect of this matter and I ask the Minister briefly to reply. Do we have child poverty as alleged? Does the Minister accept EUROSTAT's figures, even if they are based on a survey which is a few years out of date? Does he accept that the Combat Poverty Agency report claimed that one in three of all children in Ireland lives in poverty? Does he accept that the report also says we have the second highest rate of child poverty in the European Union? Does he also accept that the Combat Poverty Agency report says that child poverty is increasing? With regard to establishing the extent of the problem, does the Minister accept that it is shocking that a country with such a buoyant economy has such a high rate of child poverty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not about to say there is not any child poverty in Ireland. There is. I emphasise that the Combat Poverty Agency based its analysis on figures from 1993 which show that 28 per cent of children &ndash; not one third as the Combat Poverty Agency said &ndash; live in households believed to be below the poverty threshold. What has happened since 1993? There has been a huge change of emphasis, particularly in child benefit. Approximately £1 billion goes on child benefit. In 1993 less than £250 million was spent on it. On coming into office, the Government established a Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and much of the concentration of that sub-committee has been on child poverty. I can immediately think of a number of initiatives of that sub-committee. For example, in my area, I have established a new foundation for investing in communities which has a particular focus on building up a children's trust. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, will be bringing forward a children's trust in the near future to deal with disadvantaged children. I can assure the Deputy that the Government is concentrating on the issue of child poverty and will continue to put substantial resources into this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have established the extent of child poverty &ndash; and I do not propose to argue about whether the figure is 28 per <Col N="1084" /> cent of 33 per cent &ndash; what is the Government doing about the problem? Does the Minister accept that it is generally accepted by experts and non-experts alike that the most effective mechanism of child support is child benefit? On that basis, does the Minister agree that the 1999 provision which amounts to 28 pence per week &ndash; because the £3 per month increase does not come into effect until September &ndash; is not a useful contribution to solving the problem of child poverty? Does he accept the need for a radically new approach to child benefit? Does he accept that the Fine Gael proposal to increase child benefit to £20 per week, particularly for children aged five and under, is now quite feasible given the Exchequer funds that are available? Such an increase might not have been feasible in the past but it is now. The money is there. Does the Minister accept the need to substantially increase child benefit, particularly for smaller children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and I fully accept what previous Governments have done in substantially increasing child benefit. This benefit is universal, it is not taken into account in making assessments of means and it is not taxed. For these reasons it gets to the core of the problem particularly for low income families who most need it. However, because the benefit is universal it is extremely costly. To increase child benefit by 50 pence costs £5 million. I accept that it is the best method of progressing the question of child poverty, particularly in low income families.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to Fine Gael's recent proposal, but that is not strictly a Fine Gael proposal as it has been mooted for some time.</P>

      <P>All parties are claiming credit for it now. The report of the Commission on the Family proposed various allowances for children under the age of three and between the ages of three and five, which is akin to Deputy Bruton's recent suggestion. I firmly believe assistance should be given to families with children in that age group, but I question this proposal. This issue is being carefully examined by an interdepartmental committee in relation to the issue of child care. A family with, for example, three children aged three, four and five who have come to rely on an income under this scheme, will be bereft of that income when those children reach the age five. A family in receipt of £150 under this scheme might have their benefit cut to £100 in one fell swoop. I am not sure if that has been taken into account in this proposal, for which the Deputy on my left claimed credit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, was launched in April 1997 with the overall target of reducing the proportion of households in consistent poverty from 9 to 15 per cent to less than 5 to 10 per cent by 2007. Targets were also set under five key themes, namely, unemployment, educational disadvantage, income adequacy, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty.</P>
      <P>I will publish in the near future an assessment of our progress on the specific targets set out in the NAPS on the basis of ESRI and other research. This updated information will allow us to measure progress towards the overall target, inform the future direction of the strategy and enable us to refocus our efforts on those most in need. I would like to think we could update the key targets, in light of the rapidly changing circumstances, as part of the Government's social inclusion strategy, and we are currently doing that.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that this is just one of the targets set in NAPS. There are subsidiary targets under the five key themes of unemployment, income adequacy, educational disadvantage, urban disadvantage and rural poverty. An example would be the commitment, also referred to in Partnership 2000, that the Commission on Social Welfare's minimum recommended rates would be achieved by the end of 1999, a target which we accomplished in the 1999 budget. Measures aimed at meeting all these targets continue to be implemented across Departments, in line with the cross-dimensional approach we have adopted.</P>
      <P>Developments in this regard are overseen by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs chaired by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> With regard to progress on unemployment, considerable headway has already been made towards the NAPS target of reducing the unemployment rate to 6 per cent by 2007. The Central Statistics Office estimated the rate of unemployment at 7 per cent for January 1999. Therefore, we are well ahead of our target. Since the Government came into office the number unemployed has fallen by 46,500. This means the target for end-year 2000 set out in the employment action plan has been already achieved. Long-term unemployment stood at 3.9 per cent for the period March to May 1998, the latest figure available, with the NAPS target of 3.5 per cent by 2007 almost achieved.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science run a range of schemes aimed at countering educational disadvantage, such as Breaking the Cycle, and the home-school-community liaison scheme. The introduction of the School Attendance (Amendment) Bill, which will raise the minimum school leaving age to 16 years or on completion of at least three years of junior cycle education, should also have a positive impact on school retention rates.</P>
    <P>The spatial dimension of poverty is also being addressed on a number of fronts. In addition to national policies aimed at combating social exclusion, there are a range of initiatives which aim to tackle the particular characteristics of urban and rural disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming White Paper on Rural Development will deal with rural development as a multidimensional integrated process. The paper will set out a statement of the overall objective to be achieved together with a broad policy framework and the institutional mechanisms to achieve it. Other issues such as rural transport, rural resettlement and farm incomes are also being examined.</P>
    <P>Urban disadvantage is also being tackled on a number of fronts, through programmes such as the area-based partnerships, the URBAN programme, the national drugs strategy, the young people's facilities and services fund and the integrated services project.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to review the various targets set out in NAPS in light of the changed social and economic environment since the original targets were set. I propose to do this in the context of achievements under the Government's employment action plan, the forthcoming ESRI report and the NAPS annual report, which I expect will be published in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The Minister said a report will be published soon on the NAPS on sharing and progress. That is welcome and I hope Opposition spokespersons will be invited to the presentation. My question is closely linked to Question No. 7 tabled by Deputy O'Shea. Will the Minister agree the ESRI report published before Christmas on budget perspectives and the proceedings of the conference of 27 October 1998 showed conclusively that while increases in social welfare averaged 16 per cent, in recent budgets the average household income increased by 22 per cent? Will he also agree that under recent Government policy the richest 10 per cent of families gained more significantly from fiscal and budgetary changes than the poorest 30 per cent? They gained only half of what the richest 10 per cent gained. Is it not obvious that the poorest in our society are not sharing in the fruits of the Celtic tiger and that the Minister, as the person in charge, is not ensuring the poorest 30 per cent of families are keeping up with other categories.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister said about child benefit. At the start of the former partnership Government, the target set in respect of child care, to be achieved over five or six years, was £20 per week, although we did not reach that figure. Will the Minister agree that if we were to reach that target, as recently proposed by Fine Gael, this £700 million would be well spent? Will he also agree he is failing to meet fundamental targets set out in the NAPS?</P>

      <P>I reject that. I refer the Deputy to the figures I gave on the creation of employment, probably the most important aspect of tackling poverty. Under this Government, we are all but there in terms of achieving the targets set for reducing unemployment and creating employment. The targets set by the former Government, in which Deputy Broughan served, were not ambitious. The target set for 2007 has been all but met by the creation of approximately 47,000 jobs since June 1997 and 96,000 jobs in 1997-98. The figures in the ESRI report, to which the Deputy referred, relate primarily to the period during which the Deputy and his party were in Government. However, it is important to point out we have conflicting signals coming from the ESRI, in that in very recent days it has asked the country to control wages and show restraint while, on the other hand, it suggests that social welfare payments should rise faster than they have done. The social welfare increases in the past two budgets in which Fianna Fáil were involved either equalled or exceeded the normal wage increases, particularly the old age pension.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister referred to unemployment, which is one of the key parameters in the measurement of poverty. However, is it not a fact that, despite an unemployment rate of 7 per cent, in many constituenc<Col N="1088" /> ies including the Minister's and mine, there are parishes with unemployment rates of 30 and 40 per cent?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was involved in negotiations yesterday on Agenda 2000. The policy currently being pursued by the Government may leave those disadvantaged areas in the Minister's constituency and mine without the extra structural support from which we have benefited over the past five years and which will be badly missed by those most deprived communities. There is a major question mark over how we will target resources at deprived areas outside the Objective One region.</P>
      <P>The Minister has set up an interdepartmental group on the issue of basic income. However, is he not, in a sense, just humouring and plamásing Fr. Seán Healy and CORI and leading them along, although he has no intention of introducing a basic income along the lines argued for by Fr. Healy and his very impressive colleagues? Would it not be better for the Minister to say the Government does not believe in that kind of basic income and that it will embark on another way, which includes the existing basic incomes of the social welfare system and the minimum wage, which is a policy of the Government? Should he not just be honest with CORI and Fr. Healy?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether means tests conducted by his Department should, as far as possible, reflect actual income rather than inflated artificial income figures; and if he will change the system accordingly.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6483/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the various means tests used by my Department is to ensure that the limited resources available are directed at those most in need. In assessing means, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, for example, earnings from employment or self-employment, together with the value of any capital or property. In addition, in the case of the unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance schemes, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as that of board and lodging in the family home, is assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of assessing cash income, account is normally taken of the income that the <Col N="1090" /> person may reasonably be expected to receive during the coming 12 months. Where this is not possible to determine, the income for the last 12 months is taken as a guide, with allowances being made for any known variations. In the case of a couple, the joint income is assessed. There is also a range of disregards which apply in the assessment of income. These different disregards are designed to reflect specific policies being pursued, for example, to maximise incentives to work.</P>
    <P>For instance, under the unemployment assistance scheme, where a person works for up to three days a week, earnings are assessed at 60 per cent. In addition, persons without children are allowed a £10 disregard for each day worked, while the balance of earnings are assessed at 60 per cent. These measures are designed to ensure that claimants have an incentive to work at all levels of earnings, even where the level of pay is less than the rate of unemployment assistance. Likewise the disregard of the first £50 per week &ndash; which I was delighted to increase in our first budget from £35 &ndash; in earnings from rehabilitative employment for disability allowance and blind person's pension purposes provides an important support for people with disabilities in taking up available employment and training opportunities.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, cash income is assessed on a favourable basis for means test purposes, with the amount of income assessed in many cases being considerably below the actual income which the claimant receives.</P>
    <P>With regard to the assessment of capital, I have already indicated that it would not be feasible to assess such amounts on the basis of returns from investments, as this would necessitate frequent reviews of entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated or the capital was moved into a different investment option. For this reason, a notional value is ascribed to the capital owned.</P>
    <P>While the formula for the notional assessment of capital includes rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent, I emphasise that the effective and real assessment rates are much lower. For example, a single pensioner can have capital of up to £6,160 and a couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age (non-contributory) pension. In addition, a couple with capital of £20,000 would only be assessed with means of £600, giving an effective assessment rate of just 3 per cent. As only 2 to 4 per cent of pensioners have capital in excess of £20,000, this means that the effective assessment rates for the vast majority of pensioners are very much lower than the 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent rates which are used in the notional assessment formula.</P>
    <P>The current system is designed to ensure that those with modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support, while the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless at my instigation my Department <Col N="1091" /> is reviewing the system in the light of the interest rates currently available on investments. However, it is important for me to point out that simply reducing the assessment rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent to the current levels of interest available on bank deposit accounts would disproportionately benefit those who are well off. This was the rationale behind the decision by my predecessor, Deputy de Rossa, to set the assessment rates at their present levels.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance schemes, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as that of board and lodging in the family home, is also assessed. The purpose of this assessment is to target the available resources at those most in need, by taking account of different household circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the artificial rates of interest assessed on capital for pension applicants, applicants for disability assistance and so on. They are being assessed on means arising from a 7.5 per cent or 15 per cent interest rate when their actual income could be a mere fraction of the amount assessed.</P>
      <P>I will spell out my objections to this both for the Minister and comic strip type commentators such as 'Dreadful Drennan' who did not seem to understand this point when I raised it last week. There are two basic problems with this artificial rate of assessment. First, it is unjust and is not transparent. Some pensioners are being assessed on income which they do not have and, as a consequence, are receiving lower social welfare payments. Second &ndash; and this is where the decommissioning of the biscuit tin referred to by the parish priest in Achill comes in &ndash; this is an inducement for social welfare applicants to keep money out of banks in biscuit tins or under the bed, contrary to the advice of community and Government leaders.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we change this system to achieve a two-fold purpose. First, we would encourage people to keep their money in banks, credit unions and so on away from robbers. Second, we would have a transparent system which would take account of the fall in interest rates arising from Ireland's membership of EMU. Does the Minister accept that a system could be put in place to accommodate those concerns and that it should be put in place immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do want to be facetious but perhaps it would be helpful if the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, or Deputy O'Keeffe discussed the rationale behind this system with some of my departmental officials. The type of misinformation which is being peddled in this matter is the reason some elderly people might resort to keeping money in biscuit tins. It is important that Members of this House understand the system in order that the <Col N="1092" /> correct information will be conveyed to elderly people; that might encourage them to put their money into banks, building societies, post offices and so on.</P>
      <P>I have outlined all the facts and figures on this issue previously and they clearly indicate that when all of the disregards built into the system are taken into account, the effective assessment rate for the vast majority of people is only 3 per cent. This fact was acknowledged by Deputy De Rossa who introduced the system in the previous Government. I am not being political about this because the system has not changed since then. When Deputy De Rossa was in Government, the effective rate for people with approximately £20,000 &ndash; which is not insubstantial &ndash; was only 3 per cent. When Deputy Durkan was a Minister of State in the Department, he stated that these assessment rates were more generous than those which previously applied.</P>
      <P>The system is a reasonably complicated one but was designed as such to ensure it targeted people with a certain level of capital. If a basic assessment rate of 3 per cent applied, it would effectively mean that people with large amounts of capital would get the benefit of social welfare schemes when they would not be entitled to them. The Department rationale, under the previous Minister, sought to ensure that any available money in the social welfare scheme was targeted at people who just had their heads above water, not those pensioners who were well off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that things have changed since the advent of the euro, as a consequence of which interest rates have dropped to nominal levels? The situation which pertained in 1997 does not really apply now. The interest rate on a bank deposit could now be as low as 0.2 per cent. The Minister stated that the effective rate for pension applicants is only 3 per cent but that is more than ten times the amount people are receiving. Muintir na Tíre carried out an assessment on this matter recently and pointed out that a pension applicant with life savings of £14,000 would suffer a reduction of £12 per week in his or her pension payment as a consequence of an alleged income from the bank.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's sporting offer that we discuss this matter at the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs. Does he accept that any such discussion should be predicated on the basis that we are seeking and alternative, fairer system? I am not thinking of someone with £100,000 in the bank, rather someone with life savings of £14,000 whose pension payments will be reduced by £12 per week on the basis of an income they simply do not receive and who might be encouraged to keep that money out of the financial institutions and in the way of robbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to an interest rate on deposits of 0.2 per cent. A reduction of the 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent assessment rates to a combined 0.2 per cent rate <Col N="1093" /> and the retention of the current £2,000 disregard would have the following effects on the amounts of capital pensioners could have. Amounts of capital which pensioners could hold and still qualify for the maximum level of payment are as follows: a single OAP &ndash; £158,000; married OAPs &ndash; £316,000; widow or widower non-contributory pensioner &ndash; £158,000; and, PRETA &ndash; £54,000. The amounts of capital pensioners could hold and still qualify for reduced payment are as follows: a single OAP would currently be allowed to hold £1,978,000 rising to £2,134,000 after changes implemented in June; married OAPs &ndash; £3,956,000 at present and £4,268,000 from June.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe should call off some of the excessive publicity on this matter as it is engendering unnecessary unease among old age pensioners. I specifically refer to the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> which contained an article by one of the Deputy's colleagues, probably pedalled by Deputy O'Keeffe. I am not saying the scheme cannot be examined and that is why I have given an undertaking to review it, but I appeal for less of the excessive publicity which has resulted, particularly when stories are run on the front pages of the <i>Evening Herald</i> every now and again. It would be better if the Deputy and the journalists who run these stories would at least ask the Department for its view.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister expedite a change in the system? Having an assessment against very substantial amounts of capital might be part of the answer. Ordinary people with life savings which run to £10,000, or a bit more, and which are nothing like the stratified figures the Minister is speaking about, should not be penalised. I am convinced a system can be put in place and I want the Minister to give me a guarantee that that will be done soon so that the manifest injustice will be removed.</P>

I am not saying I am not open to changes, but it is a not a matter of saying, &ldquo;That is then, this is now&rdquo; because in effect the assessment regime which was put in place while Deputy De Rossa was Minister was quite rightly extremely generous for people at the lower end of the scale and not so for those at the upper end of the scale.</P>

Assessors are prepared to accept the costings but refuse to accept the fact that cattle and pig prices have fallen through the roof, and they make their own conclusions regarding income on that basis.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the current social welfare system is very complex and wide-ranging providing a comprehensive range of services to those in our society who are in need of them. Currently my Department administers some 44 separate income support schemes. Details of these schemes are set out in my Department's Booklet entitled <i>Guide to Social Welfare Services</i>. In addition, my Department operates a range of grant schemes under the voluntary, community and family services programmes.</P>
      <P>The evolution of the social welfare system has been largely on an incremental basis over a number of decades with new schemes, such as the farm assist and fish assist schemes which I was delighted to put in place, being developed to meet urgent and emerging needs of the day. Within the limitations on available resources the emphasis has been on ensuring that those resources are targeted at people who are most in need. As a result the social welfare system has become complex.</P>
      <P>Although Deputies frequently seek a simplified system, it is also the case that Deputies on all sides also constantly call for new schemes for particular groups as in the case of farm assist and fishing assist. The system should be simplified so that clear and easily understood information on social welfare entitlements is readily available to all our citizens. It can be confusing, not just for people claiming their entitlements, but also for people working on their behalf, such as public representatives and information providers. I am committed to simplifying the system where possible and this is a strategic aim of my Department set out in our strategy statement. However, the reality is that introducing many desirable simplifications can have significant cost implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Secondly, there is a need to ensure that the social welfare system interacts more efficiently and more effectively with other areas of public policy such as the employment services, taxation and the health services. Such reform of the social welfare system is clearly not capable of being achieved overnight. It is necessarily a gradual process.</P>
    <P>The desirability of simplifying different aspects of public services, including social welfare systems, has also been highlighted from time to time. The Comptroller and Auditor General, for example, has been critical of the duplication involved in the separate means assessments operated by various Departments who provide means-tested services to the public. My Department has been laying the basis for future efficiency in this regard by promoting the establishment of the common Public Service Number, PSN, and facilitating the future development of a common means database which could be shared by relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>Some progress has also been made in recent years in the simplification of certain social welfare schemes. For example, the schemes of payments to prisoners' wives, deserted wives and lone parents have thankfully been consolidated into the one-parent family payment scheme. Some progress has also been made in streamlining aspects of the means test for social assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>During 1998 I introduced a number of changes in the employment support services aimed at streamlining the services to unemployed people. The back-to-work allowance scheme for self-employed people was extended to four years in line with the area enterprise allowance scheme operating in designated partnership areas and the second and third level allowance scheme was combined into an enhanced back to education allowance scheme. As part of the 1999 budget I was able to announce that the income limit for fuel allowances will be brought into line with the income limit for free electricity and other free schemes with effect from next October. Furthermore, I have taken the opportunity in this year's Social Welfare Bill to introduce a more comprehensive and streamlined bereavement grant scheme to replace the existing death grant scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to future plans to simplify the system, my Department is currently engaged in a series of reviews of its programme expenditure. All Department's schemes will be evaluated, the effectiveness of the various schemes will be assessed and the scope for simplification will be examined in a systematic manner. The alignment of the means test for fuel allowances with that applying to free electricity and the other free schemes arose from that process. For example, during the course of the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill last week I indicated to the House that I had arranged for a comprehensive review of the contribution conditions for entitle<Col N="1096" /> ment to contributory old age and retirement pensions. Other proposals which are put forward in the course of that work will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has conceded that there are 44 different schemes in operation in his Department. He has also conceded that there is room for people and the administrators of the system to get confused. Does the Minister think it is of paramount importance that the system be streamlined very quickly as people are losing out due to the confusion which arises? For example, about 50 per cent of those entitled to FIS do not apply for it, in many cases because they are unaware of it or because of the complexity of the social welfare system which results in people not involving themselves in it. The issue of credits, which can be very important to people in terms of entitlements is quite confusing for people, as is the governing tax year in relation to when claims can be made in the context of benefits accumulated. Does the Minister agree these issues lead to people losing out? I recently met a girl who lost £6,000 in entitlements as she claims she got the wrong information from the social welfare office. Does the Minister agree that much confusion surrounds the schemes and that tackling this should be a matter of priority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that the provision of information is paramount. Despite the fact that the Department prides itself to some extent on the fact that the dissemination of information by it is quite good in comparison with other Departments, time and again, particularly in relation to the customer panels which have been put in place, the constant desire of people is for information. That is one of the reasons we have beefed up that area in the Department and there is a number of initiatives in that respect. I will bring forward a Bill establishing Comhairle, the new body taking over the NSSB and part of the NRB, very soon. It will provide an independent and broad service across the country with citizen information centres. In the past two budgets, I have substantially increased resources to the NSSB to provide what is, in effect, an independent information and advice service which is very necessary. When people contact Departments, not only my Department, they do not see the people there as being independent. I do not really accept that because I generally accept the bona fides of people in Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be instances where people get wrong information and there are various mechanisms in Departments to assist people in this regard. For instance, I was delighted to be able to give a substantial shot in the arm to the issue of late claims in the last budget and people are getting a sizeable balance of what they might have been entitled to. If it is proved that somebody was given false information by a Department official, he will be entitled to refunds. The Department and I, as Minister, are extremely <Col N="1097" /> anxious to ensure all available information is given to people. One would probably never be able to design a fail-safe system when dealing with 900,000 payments per week affecting 1.5 million people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us a time frame in which he will bring forward reports he has commissioned on streamlining the system? Can he give a commitment on when he might bring them forward? If I bring the Minister information on a late claim for unemployment assistance setting out quite clearly an individual case, does he have a facility whereby back payments may be made in relation to unemployment assistance? The Minister mentioned pensions, and I know about that system. Does the same system apply to unemployment assistance?</P>

The Department is required to review all the schemes, and is currently going through them. A programme is set down from year to year where all these schemes will be looked at. One of the schemes relates to the whole issue of free schemes. If the Deputy has particular cases, we can look at them. Each case will depend on its merits.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme for primary and secondary children will be changed to a cost of schooling allowance; and if it will be paid twice a year to assist those families experiencing financial difficulties in sending their children to school.</Quest>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>There is no provision under social welfare legislation to cover any other costs of school attendance. Under the scheme, an allowance of £43 is payable in respect of children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £58 is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. The Department of Education and Science has responsibility in relation to the provision of transport, school books and education fees.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the scheme has more than doubled in the past seven years from £5.6 million in 1990 to more than £11.7 million in 1998. A sum of £11 million has been set aside in the Estimates for the scheme this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> Improvements in the rate payable cannot be looked at in isolation from price inflation or improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. Substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments ranging between £3 and £6 per week effective from June 1999 were announced in last December's budget. In addition, the clothing and footwear component of the consumer price index published by the Central Statistics Office has fallen in each of the last four years. It fell by 4.3 per cent between November 1997 and November 1998 with a cumulative 15.2 per cent between November 1994 and November 1998.</P>
    <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme will be reviewed during the course of 1999 as part of my Department's series of programme expenditure evaluations. The review will take into account the suggestions made by the Deputy and the conclusions reached by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his value for money examination of the administration of the scheme in 1998. Any changes recommended in the review of the scheme will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that one of the reasons for poverty and people having difficulty accessing employment and so on is lack of schooling, particularly among people who have dropped out of school? The cost of keeping children in school is very often a fundamental factor. Since the Minister's party has come back into office, it has shown no desire to revamp the school attendance system which is, more or less, in abeyance, certainly in Dublin city and the four local authority areas.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister also accept that at this time of year parents with children at first and second levels often find items for the preparation of examinations, school trips, extra books and so on become a fundamental problem in keeping their children at school? Is this not a reason he should consider a type of cost of schooling allowance to be paid throughout the school year?</P>
      <P>As regards disadvantaged areas, the Minister will be aware that in many of the partnership areas, the partnership companies have taken initiatives, particularly in keeping children at first level and helping with the cost of books, transport and various other schooling costs. On the northside of Dublin, we have a programme called the challenger programme, but the Minister for Education and Science, has refused to help fund it. Should there be an onus on the Minister to consider this type of funding given that all the recent studies which have been done in the UK, America and elsewhere show that early schooling is a key component in someone's employability and in helping him avoid poverty throughout his life?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that under the exceptional needs payments expended by community welfare officers, there is scope for assistance to families which may find <Col N="1099" /> themselves in difficulty. The Deputy's question was more broadly based than this scheme. A review of this scheme is being undertaken. Obviously, we will look at it in the context of any proposals made. At the end of the day, it boils down to the priorities. This Government saw that it was necessary to increase child benefit by more than that which the outgoing Government had in 1997 from £25 million to £40 million in the current year. From those points of view and given the overall increases in the primary payments ahead of the rate of inflation, this Government has done pretty well. However, that is not to say more could not be done and, we are looking at it.</P>

These payments are probably focused on that end of the market, that is, those who would qualify under the Combat Poverty definition of living in poverty or the 28 per cent, the figure given by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Would he not agree that putting more money into this area might be an effective way of helping children who really need it and are living in bad circumstances? Would he forget about comparisons with previous years and accept that there will be a budget surplus of £2,500 million this year? Surely extra money could be found for such a worthy scheme. An extra 28p per week in child benefit is no excuse for not looking at the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the growing gap between the incomes of the poor and the better off gives rise to concern in view of the ESRI report dated October 1998 which shows that social welfare rates has risen in the past four years by 16 per cent while the average incomes for all households have risen on average by 22 per cent.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6435/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Government's key objectives is the establishment of an inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity and the incentive to participate in the social and economic life of the country.</P>
      <P>With specific regard to increases in social welfare rates, developments in this area in recent years have been determined having regard to the commitments contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
      <P>The recent budget increases mean that all rates of payment will be at or above the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, ranging from 100 per cent to 123 per cent of the minimum rate. This is in keeping with the commitment in both Partnership 2000 and the national anti-poverty strategy that the minimum rates would be achieved for all rates by the end of 1999. I am delighted to be able to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, another substantial step was made towards increasing the old age contributory pension to £100 by 2002, as provided for in An Action Programme for the Millennium, with an increase of £6 per week announced in the 1999 budget following a £5 per week increase in 1998. The 1999 budget also provided increases in child <Col N="1101" /> benefit &ndash; £3 per month for the first and second children and £4 per month for subsequent children which, together with increases in the weekly income thresholds for the family income supplement, will also be of significant help to many low income households. Similarly, low-income farmers and certain fishermen will benefit from the new farm assist and fishing assist measures contained in the 1999 Social Welfare Bill which are specifically geared towards supporting those most in need.</P>
    <P>In general, there have been significant real increases in social welfare rates in recent years. For example, between 1995 and 1998, social welfare payments increased by 13 per cent to 14 per cent compared to a total rise in the consumer price index of less than 6 per cent over the same period. The changes announced in the 1999 budget amount to an increase of 4.3 per cent in the general rate and over 7 per cent for pensioners compared to an expected inflation rate of around 2 per cent and expected growth in average industrial earnings of about 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>In relation to future increases a number of factors will have to be taken into account. It will remain a priority to ensure that the value of payments will, at the least, be maintained in real terms. In addition, as stated previously, this Government is committed to raising the old age pension to £100 per week &ndash; a rate of increase expected to significantly exceed inflation.</P>
    <P>It is intended, in the context of NAPS, to consider the issue of income adequacy in its broad sense, including the areas of taxation, employment, etc. In this regard, my Department intends to examine the role of social welfare rates and, in particular, the appropriate future direction for social welfare payments, now that the Commission on Social Welfare's minimum rates have been achieved. This examination will, of course, also take account of other considerations, notably incentives to employment, budgetary considerations, etc.</P>
    <P>This process will be informed by all relevant research and data, including the ESRI's Review of the Commission on Social Welfare's minimum adequate income and the national pension policy initiative, Securing Retirement Income, as well as the research referred to by the Deputy. The forthcoming report from the ESRI on recent poverty trends, 1994 to 1997, expected by Easter 1999, which will update the 1994 Living in Ireland survey on which the original NAPS targets were based, will also have an important role to play in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not the central finding of the ESRI's budget report of last October unanswerable? I accept the Minister's point that the rainbow Government was in power in 1994 but so was this Government and there was a significant increase in income in average households over social welfare households which are totally dependent on us for their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister on seeking to fulfil the <Col N="1102" /> promise made to the electorate concerning the £100 per week payment for pensioners. However, effectively, the Minister is introducing a multi-annual budget for pensioners. He has decided on a target towards which he is moving. Is there not a case for doing the same for all other social welfare recipients, those on insurance and assistance? Should we not set a target for, let us say, 2002, and for 2007 with regard to the NAPS parameters, and try to move towards those targets? This would provide a decent basic income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been upgraded and that is the best target we have. The first question to ask is where we go once we have achieved that rate. That will be looked at and the ESRI has made statements in this respect. The institute has given one view concerning social welfare and another view on the control of wages. The money available is finite.</P>
      <P>The decision made by the Government when it came into office was not dictated by the ESRI. It was a political decision based on the common sense of politicians who know that old people have fallen behind. We made that decision and we are sticking by it. The £5 and £6 increases given in successive budgets go further than would have been required to achieve the £100 target by 2002. We only needed to give about £4.75 in those two years. I assure the Deputy, and others, that as long as the Government is in office, it will concentrate on old age pensioners not only with regard to social welfare, but also in areas covered in the last budget, such as the announcement by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, of radical changes in relation to medical cards. In addition, the Minister for Finance took 15,000 old age pensioners out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>I make no apology for concentrating on this area. However, this does not mean we should forget other people. The current inflation rate is 2 per cent, although the Opposition said the ultimate inflation rate for last year would be well over that figure.</P>

The ESRI report, which will be published around Easter, will have some views in that regard and they will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>As I stated previously in relation to the national anti-poverty strategy, I have undertaken to review and, I hope bring forward new targets, particularly given that we have almost reached the targets on employment, which is the best cure for poverty, set by the previous Government for 2007.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the 1996 census, there were more than 174,500 people over 75 years of age when the census was compiled. In 1995-96 more than 152,000 people over 75 years <Col N="1104" /> of age were in receipt of a social welfare pension from my Department; therefore, coverage of this age cohort is estimated to be 87 per cent. The remaining 13 per cent would include qualified adults of social welfare recipients and those who do not qualify for a contributory pension or have not met the means test for a non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the social insurance system and on foot of the extension of this system over the past ten years, the role of contributory &ndash; PRSI related &ndash; pensions will increase in the future. It is not known, of those who are not receiving a payment from my Department, how many are in receipt of pensions from other sources, that is, occupational pensions or social security pensions from other countries.</P>
      <P>In my budget speech, I announced that my Department will carry out a comprehensive review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions. This review will pay particular attention to the operation of the yearly average qualifying condition, including the possibility of using contributions paid prior to 1953. The issues involved are complex and raise fundamental questions regarding the number of contributions, both paid and credited, of a person. Issues of equity and redistribution within the social insurance system also need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The free schemes, such as the free electricity and free telephone rental allowances and free television licence, are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition. In addition, widows-widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement. The free schemes are also available to low income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age contributory pension, which is currently £83 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years and £88 for a recipient aged 80 years or over plus £30 plus any increases for dependants or living alone. In order to qualify for the free schemes, a person must be living alone or only with certain other people who satisfy this condition. This condition is not, however, applied in the case of persons aged over 75 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.</P>
      <P>Regarding the estimated number of people over age 75 who are not in receipt of the various free schemes, 71,200 people do not receive the free electricity or gas allowances and the free television licence while 83,000 do not receive the free telephone rental allowance. The reasons for this include a person living in a household that already receives the free schemes &ndash; the allowances are per household and not per person; a person not in receipt of a qualifying payment or above the means threshold, and issues related to take up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. A fundamental review of the free schemes has commenced in order to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. It is hoped this will be completed by mid-year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response. It appears only a relatively small number of people aged over 75 years are not in receipt of any of the free schemes. These people survived the Civil War, the difficulties of poverty in the 1920s and 1930s and World War II. They are now in their twilight years and they are finding it difficult to make ends meet. They are not receiving any State aid and it would be a nice gesture to extend the free schemes to them. Two 90 year old people walked into my office on separate occasions recently. They are not in receipt of pensions from the Department and, therefore, they do not qualify for the free schemes. They felt at this stage of their lives that the State should acknowledge them in some way. Does the Minister agree this area should be considered? They are a deserving group and, as the Minister admitted, it only involves a small number of people. Can the Minister do something for them?</P>

It is a considerable number of people.</P>
      <P>It must be acknowledged by all sides that no Government in recent times has concentrated more on the elderly than this Administration. It might have been easier to give everybody a set amount as was done previously. However, the Government made a conscious decision to put money in old people's pockets and we make no apologies for it. Taking into account changes in the medical card scheme for people over the age of 75, and changes whereby 15,000 old age pensioners over the age of 66 have been taken out of the tax net as a result of the last budget, one is pushing an open door with this Government on issues relating to old age pensioners. Ultimately, this is one of the reasons we instigated the review of the free schemes, and it is hoped that this free scheme review will be available mid-year. That will determine what changes, if any, we will make. Obviously the one the Deputy raised will be looked at in that context.</P>

    <Title>National Disability Authority Bill, 1998  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;<b></b></P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The publication of the National Disability Authority Bill and the provisions included in it should signal an important step forward for the rights of people with disability and an important stepping up of the quality and quantity of services for them. I am not at all confident this Bill will live up to expectations or what the authority will mean for them.</P>
      <P>The function of the authority is mainly to advise the Minister on a range of issues affecting people with disability, including the co-ordination and development of policy. The authority is also to have an important function in researching issues confronting people with disability and in advising the Minister on those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not spelled out in the Bill how enforcement of standards will come into play. People with disability often have a terrible time trying <Col N="1107" /> to access services in a dignified way. They meet obstacles where there should be none. The simplest of tasks that able-bodied people take for granted, such as, getting on buses, flagging down and getting into a taxi, or ordering a taxi, are hugely problematic for people with disability. Agencies and companies, both private and public, have been extremely negligent of the need to provide for that significant section of our people who have a disability in some area of their lives. It is not good enough that only weeks ago a person in a wheelchair did not have the facility to book a taxi designed to carry a wheelchair.</P>
    <P>The authority is given functions in advising on these matters but on the question of who implements and enforces the standards that are agreed to be necessary to make life better for people with disability the Bill is silent. Local authorities have an important role, in the context of buildings, streets and so on, in making life easier for people with disability, but who will police that? Bringing in this Bill in isolation from the Bill setting up Comhairle does not allow for an integrated discussion of all aspects that relate to making life easier for people with disability.</P>
    <P>Another concern which arises in connection with all Bills setting up authorities, state boards, and so on is that it provides for the entire membership of the authority, bar one, to be appointed by the Minister of the day. It provides that the members should be people with disability or families or carers of such people or people in the field. However, why should the right be given exclusively to the Minister to appoint all the members? Why is there not a procedure to democratically elect people from those groups, the carers, people with disability, the many fine organisations that, in a voluntary capacity generally, provide many desperately needed services for people with disability? Why is there not a democratic right for those organisations to elect their representatives to the authority, rather than giving the Minister the right to select the person he or she thinks is best? For decades, the four or five political parties that have dominated Government since the foundation of the State, have been stuffing boards with people who are just party hacks and not necessarily people with any particular skill or expertise in areas covered by whatever board or authority is being set up. I find this extremely objectionable.</P>

      <P>I wish to interject, lest the Deputy's comments should reflect on the National Disability Authority members who were announced last July. I hope, and I presume, that the Deputy is not attempting to cast a reflection on the members of the authority. The Deputy is confused between the elected Irish Council of People with Disabilities and the National Disability Authority, which are two different organisations.</P>

        <b>:</b> I do not know the individuals involved. I strenuously object to the principle of always giving Ministers the power to appoint at their sole discretion, rather than having a democratic procedure which allows organisations, in this case voluntary organisations, to elect their own representatives to the authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, introduced it because she has had an interest in, and been committed to, people with disabilities for a long time. I also pay tribute to the previous Administration, which set up the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. As a result of much discussion and the participation of groups with the necessary expertise, experience and skill, the commission brought forward recommendations, which, I hope, have been translated into the Bill.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, people with disabilities were told what was good for them, but I hope the new authority and the equality authority, which will further resource, support and monitor the disability authority, will put in place mechanisms whereby people will be able to inform us about what they believe is good for them rather than being told by us. That is the greatest acknowledgment we can give people with disabilities who have been sidelined for many years.</P>
      <P>All of us are guilty of not displaying enough awareness about these people and we have spoken over their heads and ignored them. Work has been done by the Department and the commission, which will be continued by the authority, to make the public aware that the lives and careers of those with disabilities must be acknowledged, resourced and supported. This, of course, should also take into consideration the huge role played by many carers in helping people to participate fully in everyday life.</P>
      <P>I had the privilege of serving as a Senator and am aware that the passage of legislation through the Seanad allows for indepth discussion and amendment. The concept of mainstreaming is proposed in the Bill, which will bring people in from the cold. However, 40 per cent of people with disabilities are of working age and, with the aid of resources provided under the Bill, I hope they will be able to develop careers and be financially independent. Tribute must be paid to the voluntary and community organisations which are not co-ordinated or resourced to the extent the new authority will be. However, the co-ordination of these organisations and others, such as FÁS, will be mainstreamed in a way that has never happened before and that is positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is huge potential, with the advances in technology through research and monitoring, to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. It is not just a matter of improving support systems. Many Members spoke about accessibility and so on. The Minister is pursuing the issue with great energy, but incredible pro<Col N="1109" /> gress has been made with audiovisual aids. A professor in the UK is experimenting with a microchip to allow him communicate with people with disabilities. We are only on the doorstep of this technology.</P>
    <P>Investment in the authority should centre on research and development because it is the fastest and most productive way to enable people with disabilities, who did not have the opportunity previously, to gain independence. I look forward to the results of the research. An independent agency is needed to concentrate fully on this area.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what Government is in office, research is essential because it will enable the necessary legislation to be introduced and show the need for resources to support the objectives of bodies such as the National Disability Authority. The authority's aim is to enable people with disabilities to control their own lives and to make them aware that resources are available to realise their potential.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a report will be laid before the Houses each year. Many reports are laid before the Houses annually and, while they are valuable, they lie on dusty shelves and are not debated. The disability authority report should be debated annually so that members can monitor progress and lobby for what is needed.</P>
    <P>When will the equality authority be set up? The disability authority is the first step in that direction, but the grievance procedure which people with disabilities need will come under equality authority. An expansion of resources, staff and professional experts is also required for that authority. We will lobby the Minister of State in that regard.</P>
    <P>In many other areas attempts have been made to meet the needs of people and to deal with discrimination. Through the years various supports, resources and payments have emanated from a variety of Departments. The child care issue is one example of which we are all aware and the expert working group highlighted that it did not lie within the purview or resources of one Department. It is to be hoped an interdepartmental committee to deal inclusively with the area under the remit of the Bill will be established, with each Department taking responsibility and ceding power where needs be to allow for a more co-ordinated approach. Such a committee has been mooted in the Minister of State's speech and various Departments will have an input in the areas of health, education, social welfare and the environment. The last mentioned is important because planning is of enormous consequence in this area. The establishment of such an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee, especially in the early days, and perhaps headed up by the Minister of State's Department, would be tremendously effective. The co-ordination the Bill attempts to achieve would be made more effective if such an interdepartmental committee were established.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is steering the Bill through the House and has a significant input into it, I find it ironic <Col N="1110" /> that Ministers are still referred to in legislation in the masculine form. It could be that the senior Minister in her Department is being alluded to, but I imagine it is the case in the drafting of all legislation which comes to the House. I will continue to stress this point, especially given that women Ministers and staff have a considerable input into this legislation. Perhaps the Minister of State might examine that matter in future and ensure the language of legislation is gender proofed.</P>
    <P>Other Members have drawn from their experiences in their constituencies, and national organisations have lobbied Members about their needs. In my intervention in Deputy Callely's speech earlier, I was not trying to make a party political point and I am sure the Minister of State understands that. I was trying to say that, given the improvement in the economy, the budget for the structures being put in place is a start, but we all agree that it is only that. One has only to speak to carers and people waiting for respite, day beds or even just communication, information and support, to discover that a considerable continuing investment is needed. Minorities in Ireland have suffered because of the country's historically poor economic and employment performance. I would like to believe they can now come in from the cold and, in that regard, affirmative action is needed. One recommendation the new authority could bring forward is some form of affirmative action. We need to give grant incentives and establish some form of recognition for businesses, especially private ones, which quickly improve access for and offer employment placement to disabled people to fulfil their potential.</P>
    <P>We should all find it sobering that the Constitution can sometimes act against our best intentions in emphasising the rights of minorities over those of the more powerful and privileged. That is an area which must be examined. Attempts by the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, to introduce specific legislation encountered difficulties. Constitutional provision in this area is contrary to every principle of the common good, the national interest and the rights of those who most need the protection of the Constitution. That area should be examined soon.</P>
    <P>The input of people with disabilities is needed to allow for the better design of houses. A start could be made with public housing and an attempt made in the long-term to put across the message to architects and planners. For example, there is a need for wider doors for ease of access. Even able-bodied people find the planning of houses in terms of the height of sinks and baths, for example, is not just unfriendly but downright hostile at times. The input of more people who have experienced the frustration of dealing with that kind of bad planning and design should be taken into consideration. I hope that is something the new authority will not only examine but in which it will also influence change in line with planning reforms it is hoped will come from the <Col N="1111" /> Department of the Environment and Local Government. This is one area which impinges on people's lives more than the greater issues being addressed in the legislation.</P>
    <P>While I am aware this matter is more suited to the Department of Education and Science, the mainstreaming of as many children with disabilities as possible into schools, so that they share the same schools, buildings and curriculum, is of paramount importance. It cannot be done without many resources being invested, many extra professional staff and smaller pupil-teacher ratios and groupings. That is an area for which the Minister will need much support and we on this side of the House will support any efforts made to achieve greater resources, especially for remedial support services.</P>
    <P>The increase in the budget this year should urge us to begin lobbying now for next year's budget. Perhaps one of the greatest ways of welcoming in the new millennium is by recognising, acknowledging and affording the opportunity for the development of the potential of people who were treated in an horrendous manner in this millennium. Progress has been made, but there have been many victims of the type of terribly cruel behaviour people believed could be inflicted on them. Money would be well spent allowing them reclaim their lives, to gain an independence they have not known and to ensure the next millennium is more inclusive than this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of addressing the House on the Bill. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, for bringing it forward. I am aware of her commitment and wish her well in enacting the legislation. The authority should be established on a statutory basis and I welcome its terms of reference and functions as set out in the Bill, such as the co-ordination and development of policy relating to persons with disabilities. I hope the authority will succeed in co-ordinating the many efforts in that regard.</P>
      <P>The issue of disability probably spans every Department. Any Department which has dealings with people is probably also involved in dealing with people with disabilities and providing facilities for them. One example is the Department of Education and Science. There is no set of rights for children with disabilities from pre-school to higher education. The wheel has to be re-invented every time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will exert her influence in the Department of Education and Science to ensure the necessary facilities will be readily available. Parents who wish to send their child with a disability to the local national school hit a brick wall. They are sent from Billy to Jack and do not know to whom they should speak. I know of a child in a wheelchair who was enrolled last Easter in the local national school to start in September. It took well into October to provide a ramp and there was no classroom assistant avail<Col N="1112" /> able to help the teacher look after the child whose mother had to go to the school each day at the appointed time to change him. That is unacceptable. Everything should fall into place automatically. The problem is not confined to the primary sector. I am aware of a bright young man in a wheelchair in my own locality who is attending university. It took until Christmas to have the proper facilities provided. This is not fair.</P>
    <P>Parents have to take the Department of Education and Science to court to have the rights of their children with disabilities vindicated. There is a long list of cases pending. Taxpayers' money is being wasted in contesting cases. It would be far better to use this money to provide the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>The authority should co-ordinate the development of policy. Much research is being conducted inside and outside the country. The authority should undertake to draw together the conclusions of that research to ensure the best possible facilities are provided. It will advise the Minister on appropriate standards for programmes and services. There is much work to be done in this respect. Too often people with disabilities are treated as the poor relation and do not get a fair crack of the whip. The authority will also advise the Minister on the implementation of standards and codes of practice in programmes and services and liaise with other bodies in the provision of services. Virtually every Department has a role to play in relation to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In the public service there is a quota system in place. It is expected that 3 per cent of employees will be people with disabilities. Most public bodies can hang their heads in shame. The Oireachtas probably does not reach the quota. Local authorities do not reach it. Deputy Barnes mentioned local authority housing. Those who design local authority housing should be conscious of the needs of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The make-up of the authority has been mentioned. Section 20 highlights the desirability that a majority of the authority should be persons with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers and, in the case of each member of the authority, he or she should have knowledge or experience, directly or indirectly, of matters pertaining to disability. Members of the authority should know what they are talking about, have first-hand experience of the difficulties people with disabilities encounter and be in a position to give the Minister proper advice to ensure the necessary changes are made.</P>
    <P>It all comes down to resources. I acknowledge the Minister of State's <i>bona fides</i> in terms of her concern for people with disabilities but does she have clout at Government level to secure the necessary resources? In many instances autistic children do not have access to the services they require. This should be looked at urgently. The Minister of State should use her good offices to ensure better services are provided.</P>
    <P>On the news recently a person in a wheelchair <Col N="1113" /> highlighted the difficulties people with disabilities encounter in using public telephones and automatic teller machines. I was ashamed to discover that the person concerned is living in my home town of Mullingar. The telephone he was trying to use was installed in recent months in a building owned by the local authority on which in excess of £500,000 has been spent. I thought it had been tastefully renovated. Architects should be more aware of the services required. Unless they do so, we will make mistakes such as those which were shown up on television the other night. It is something of which we must be conscious.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have become conscious of the need to dish footpaths, but another area for which the local authorities have responsibility is the parking of cars on footpaths. Sometimes I am guilty of this too. We park on footpaths to run into the shop and pick up something which we think is urgent. If somebody comes along in a wheelchair, he or she cannot pass. Two wheelchair users live at the top of the street where I have my office. Often they come down the street and cannot go any further because there is a car parked on the footpath. That is totally unacceptable. We must be conscious of the need to keep those footpaths clear. The local authority's traffic wardens should be ruthless in enforcing the clearway on footpaths for wheelchair users.</P>
    <P>There is also a difficulty regarding car parking spaces specially designated for wheelchair users and people with disabilities. Time and again when these people try to get into those spaces somebody else, who does not have the sticker which entitles them to use such spaces, has parked in them. That is also unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in many schools which were built in a different era. The school in which I taught for 20 years is totally inaccessible for somebody in a wheelchair. It is a two-storey building which was designed to be a three-storey building at a later stage. We must be conscious of design and ensure that people can gain access to those places.</P>
    <P>However, all is not lost. Tremendous work is being done in many areas. Earlier this week I received a nice letter from a regular correspondent who is wheelchair bound. He has a minibus which gives him a certain degree of mobility. He writes to me regularly about difficulties which he experiences in using the footpaths, etc.. In his letter, he stated that I would be surprised to hear from him on a positive note. He had gone on a conducted tour of the Mullingar arts centre, a new development in what used be the old county hall on which there was considerable expenditure and which is totally wheelchair accessible. I commend him for taking the time to write and say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;. I am a director of the centre and I suppose that was the context in which he wrote to me. He said it was nice to see that things are coming up to scratch at last. It means he now has an opportunity of attending plays, shows, concerts, etc., in a fine facility. Until now, his access <Col N="1114" /> to that building was limited. The thought which has gone into designing the new development has made it possible for him to enjoy an outing.</P>
    <P>We have also renovated the swimming pool in Mullingar. Shamefully, an order placed last August with a company to supply a hoist to enable people with disabilities to gain access to the pool is still not in place. It is disgraceful that disabled people should be treated in that way. I have raised the matter regularly with the council and, unfortunately, the company does not exhibit any urgency in completing the job. It would not be tolerated if it was for other people. Why should it be tolerated when it is for people with disabilities?</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. It is a step forward which will improve the outlook for and the prospects of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A number of groups and organisations have over the years provided facilities for disabled people, even when it was not popular. Earlier somebody mentioned the many religious organisations who for years cared for the disabled when virtually nobody else did so. While they may not be getting good press in many respects at present, we must never speak ill of them or forget the debt we owe them for their tremendous work in caring for those people. As in our own field, in any walk of life one will have difficulties with a small percentage of people. We should acknowledge the religious orders which did so much for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I commend the Irish Wheelchair Association for its tremendous work over the years on a limited budget. In more recent times it has had access to FÁS workers. The association provides a valuable outlet with facilities and opportunities for people who are wheelchair bound. I marvel at the work of the association over the years. Many of its members worked for years in a voluntary basis. They helped to give a day out or a couple of days out to people less fortunate than themselves. It has grown into a more comprehensive service thanks to the dedication of a few people, such as Mr. Peter Stokes, of whom Minister Mary Wallace will be aware. He brought along many others who helped out and they are now taking his place in other ways. I want to mention, in particular, a young lady in my area, Ms Veronica Irwin, who does fantastic work and of course St. Peter's Hospital at Castlepollard, which the Minister visited not too long ago, dedicated entirely to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I hope the authority will have the kind of clout it deserves and that the Minister will bring forward the badly needed investment and facilities. I hope investment in education, regulations in relation to new buildings, etc., will flow from this authority and that its recommendations will be responded to by Government with the necessary investment. I hope the question of access to technology for disabled people will be addressed also.</P>
    <P>Those of us involved in politics, many of whom have spoken on the Bill, must ask how accessible <Col N="1115" /> our offices are in the constituencies. As Members of this House, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that they are fully accessible. I am glad to say that my office is accessible, but we should all look into our hearts in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by commenting on the positive note of Deputy McGrath's contribution, where he stated that attitudes to people with disabilities are changing in society. I welcome the positive comments of Deputies on all sides of the House with regard to the legislation and the future of the National Disability Authority.</P>
      <P>The access awareness question raised by Deputy McGrath is important because it opens up a whole new world for people with disabilities. The concern expressed by Deputy Barnes about the term &ldquo;he/she&rdquo; in the legislation is important. We will review the matter again before Committee Stage. She also asked me about the timeframe for the Equality Authority. On Monday next, 8 March, the Minister will announce the members of the Equality Authority and the timeframe.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the status of the disabilities Bill. I regret I had to leave the Chamber during the Deputy's contribution to deal with a child care question but I heard it on the monitor. As the Deputy will know the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill were found to be unconstitutional. We hoped to produce the disabilities Bill long before now but because both these Bills had to be reviewed, that presented a difficulty in terms of producing the Bill. The Bill is on the agenda of the Department and will be dealt with following this Bill and other elements of the equality legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the independence of the chair of the authority. Section 31 provides for the standard safeguard whereby members of the authority shall withdraw from and take no part in the business of the authority in which they have an interest. There should be no concern about that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins was concerned about the members appointed to the authority. All the members were appointed because of their interest and expertise in the area of disability. The Deputy also expressed views with regard to the Comhairle Bill. That is a separate issue to the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton was concerned about the title proposed for the authority, an issue that arose in the commission's recommendation. The Deputy will be pleased to know that the title National Disability Authority was proposed by people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Browne and Finucane referred to the importance of FÁS. Their concerns about FÁS will be included in the new arrangements. Deputy McGuinness expressed concerns about employers. The work adaptation grant is available to <Col N="1116" /> employers wishing to employ people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I thank the many Deputies who contributed to this positive debate and I look forward to a more detailed debate on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter with the Minister. The Sisters of Mercy recently commissioned a very valuable report on the experiences of marginalised groups in the west. The results of this survey are of grave concern to all who are interested in promoting equality and justice in society.</P>
      <P>The survey underlines that the fight for equality for all citizens is very much a live issue. The Labour Party fully supports the fight for equality. In the previous Government we ensured that equal status and employment equality legislation were brought through the Oireachtas. Unfortunately, this legislation was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Since then, we have waited more than 18 months for this Government to reintroduce the Equal Status Bill. The Labour Party has published its own Private Members' Bill which overcomes the flaws identified in the Supreme Court, yet there is still no sign of a Government Bill on this issue.</P>
      <P>That legislation is needed to protect the rights of people is underlined by the results of the Sisters of Mercy survey which demonstrates that travellers, refugees, asylum seekers, gay and lesbian people and those living in poverty continue to be stigmatised and marginalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most frightening findings of the report is that gay and lesbian people are seriously concerned about homophobia in the west, and many have to live with the constant threat of violence. Recent events in Sligo underline the reality of this fear. Robert Drake is an American writer who moved to Sligo at the end of last year. He is a young, gay American man who has a great love <Col N="1117" /> for Ireland, its literature and its people. Robert Drake was viciously attacked and is currently in a coma in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. His vision of Ireland as a welcoming country was brutally shattered by the violent assault he suffered in Sligo.</P>
    <P>Robert Drake may not recover from this vicious attack. His friends are attempting to raise $10,000 to fly him home so that he can receive treatment and care among his family and friends. The Minister should make a contribution to the fund established to assist Robert Drake and I hope he will indicate his willingness to do so in his reply.</P>
    <P>The tragic case of Robert Drake only serves to underline how precarious civil and human rights can be when confronted by prejudice and ignorance. Unfortunately, prejudice is alive and well in Irish society and many people still suffer from abuse and discrimination because of the colour of their skin, their sexual orientation or the disability with which they live.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the Government's efforts in addressing the equality agenda and in promoting a pluralist society in Ireland. Since the abolition of the Department of Equality and Law Reform, this agenda has slipped down the Government's programme. The difficulties experienced by thousands of Irish people remain. The threat of violence, the lack of respect and the feelings of isolation and exclusion are real issues that confront people every day.</P>
    <P>The Government has an obligation to show leadership on these issues. Equal status legislation must be introduced. Community based projects that tackle prejudice and ignorance must be funded and supported by Government. The results of the recent survey by the Sisters of Mercy should act as a wake-up call to the Minister and the Government. The tardy and half-hearted approach to the equality agenda can no longer be the hallmark of this Government's term in office. The issues are too serious for that to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to it on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
      <P>The report referred to is a study of justice and spirituality by the Sisters of Mercy, Western Province. The report is wide-ranging and I will confine my comments to those aspects of the report which relate to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, outlaws discrimination in employment on nine distinct grounds &ndash; gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. The scope of the Act is comprehensive and deals with discrimination in all work-related areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act provides for the establishment of a new infrastructure to underpin the Act and the proposed equal status legislation. The new infra<Col N="1118" /> structure will comprise two new organisations &ndash; the Equality Authority, which will replace the Employment Equality Agency, and the office of the Director of Equality Investigations, to provide redress of first instance.</P>
    <P>Work is on schedule in the Department to put in place the new organisations and we hope to be in a position to commence implementing the Act by the middle of the year.</P>
    <P>The prohibition on discrimination in employment will have a parallel outside the workplace. Revised equal status legislation is now being developed by the Department on the same general lines as that found to be unconstitutional in 1997 but amended to meet the Supreme Court's requirements. The proposed Equal Status Bill will take the fight against discrimination beyond the workplace and into such areas as provision of goods and services, accommodation and education. Services will be defined broadly to include facilities for refreshment and entertainment, banking, transport and medical services. The measures will also contain sanctions against private registered clubs which are found to be discriminating. It is envisaged that the Bill will be published before the Dáil resumes after the Easter recess. Once the Employment Equality Act, 1998 and the revised equal status legislation come into force, Ireland will have one of the most comprehensive and modern anti-discrimination codes in Europe.</P>
    <P>Discrimination against travellers is an issue of particular concern to the Department. In June 1998, the Minister established a committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the travelling community. The committee, which is chaired by the Department, is representative of traveller interests, each of the four pillars of Partnership 2000 and relevant Government Departments. A report on progress will be prepared later this year.</P>
    <P>Another initiative undertaken by the Department was the setting up last July of a consultative committee on racism and interculturalism. The consultative committee operates as a partnership of non-governmental organisations, State agencies, social partners and Government Departments and advises the Government on matters relating to racism and interculturalism. An allocation of £90,000 is provided to the consultative committee this year.</P>
    <P>The Department has taken a key role in tackling violence against women. The national steering committee on violence against women was established in December 1997. The aim of the committee is to provide a multi-disciplinary and cohesive response to victims of domestic violence and rape-sexual assault. Research is under way into the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996. The aim of the research is to provide a baseline of data and informed comment on the implementation of the domestic violence legislation. This project will document the way domestic violence is responded to by the Garda <Col N="1119" /> and processed through the civil law and criminal justice system. The results of this research will be available towards the end of April.</P>
    <P>The Government is publicly committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities are comprehensively addressed. The measures put in place since the present Government came into office underline the depth of its commitment. As Deputies will know, the legislation to establish the National Disability Authority is currently before the House. The NDA will be responsible for the research and development of standards for services and programmes provided to people with disabilities. It will also monitor and evaluate implementation of standards in the services provided and will act as an expert body in the development of policy on disability issues. As part of our work in 1999 on mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities, training and employment services currently being provided by the National Rehabilitation Board will transfer to FÁS. A new agency, Comhairle, under the auspices of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, is being established which aims to ensure that services for people with disabilities will become an integral part of mainstream information, advice and advocacy services for all.</P>
    <P>As regards asylum seekers, I emphasise that the refugee determination procedures were put in place following extensive consultation with the UNHCR. The UNHCR has stated that, &ldquo;overall, we believe that the revised document provided for a balanced administrative procedure pending the entry into force of the Refugee Act&rdquo;. The new procedures were amended in March 1998 after consultation with the UNHCR and NGOs to provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for an independent appeals mechanism in manifestly unfounded cases. The new procedures now provide for appeals to independent appeals officers or authorities at all stages of the process.</P>
    <P>Child care is another issue in the report in which the Department has taken an active role.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined form a broad package to tackle discrimination and marginalisation in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this very serious matter. While I have great admiration for the Minister of State, Deputy Moffat, it is significant that both the Tánaiste and her Minister of State, who are responsible for jobs, are absent this evening and that the Government has sent a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children to respond to this debate. I realise that we are discussing the health of industry in Cork but I regret the absence of the Minister responsible for this matter. The Tánaiste is always in evidence when notional jobs, many of which do not come to fruition, are being <Col N="1120" /> announced. When jobs are being lost she is conspicuous by her absence. This is not the first time this has happened in relation to job losses in Cork.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Cork was shocked again by the news that Liebert, in Model Farm Road, is to close with the loss of 150 jobs. Workers and their families were stunned by this announcement because it follows closely on the loss of 450 jobs in Apple, the announcement of 120 job losses in Bourns Electronics in Mahon and the closure of the Universal Foods factory in Midleton with the loss of between 65 and 170 jobs. These closures mean that Cork will have lost between 800 and 900 industrial jobs in only four weeks. This figure does not include the spin-off jobs which will inevitably be lost as a result of these closures.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste is frequently heard announcing notional jobs, many of which never come to fruition, but she is notably silent when jobs are being lost. When 450 jobs were lost at Apple Computers the Tánaiste came to Cork to address the Cork Chamber of Commerce dinner, the biggest business function of the year in Cork. She hardly uttered a word about the impending disaster of the closure of Apple, something about which she knew.</P>
      <P>At a time when the clichéd Celtic tiger is developing its muscles Cork is reeling from four successive industrial body blows. Serious questions must be asked regarding this litany of closures. Were the Tánaiste and the Government forewarned? Did the IDA early warning system operate and, if so, what political intervention has taken place to deal with these problems?</P>
      <P>Last evening job losses at the Bourns factory in Cork were discussed on the Adjournment. My colleague, Deputy Stanton, will speak of another closure at Universal Foods. In response to the Adjournment debate yesterday the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, trotted out the usual platitudes about promised jobs and projects which have the potential to create 7,000 new jobs. Potential and notional jobs are no consolation to people who are now on the road to unemployment centres. We do not want promises of notional jobs and task forces. We want to know what steps are being taken to protect the existing jobs on which so many Cork workers and their families depend to pay their weekly food bills and high mortgage repayments.</P>
      <P>Liebert Corporation, in an announcement last evening, said that the plant in Cork will cease manufacturing on 30 June. A number of technical positions will become available in the company's Italian and Slovakian facilities but all other employees will be declared redundant.</P>
      <P>In her absence, I demand that the Tánaiste make personal contact with the principals of the company and make every effort to salvage this critical situation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for raising this issue on the Adjournment and I apologise for <Col N="1121" /> the Minister's absence on this occasion. I disagree with the Deputy's remarks about notional jobs. The Minister is very honourable in all her dealings in regard to industry.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's disappointment over the decision by Liebert to close its Cork plant and I sympathise with the workers and their families. Liebert International BV was established in Cork in 1978 and currently employs 100 permanent and approximately 40 temporary people in the manufacture of air conditioning equipment for the computer and telecommunication industries. The company's immediate parent company is Liebert Corporation based in Ohio, USA. Its ultimate parent is Emerson Electric Company, a $13 billion global enterprise with headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri.</P>
      <P>Liebert, as part of its strategy for growing its business in Europe, has acquired a major competitor in Italy, the Hiross Group, whose market share in Europe is greater than Liebert's. The restructuring of Liebert's operations, which followed this acquisition, has given Hiross the lead role in growing the Liebert business in Europe. Because Liebert now has excess capacity in Europe, it has decided to rationalise its European operations and, as part of this restructuring, has decided to close the Cork plant.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland met the company on Friday, 26 February 1999, as part of its normal review process. While acknowledging that the Cork plant was at risk due to the rationalisation process, local management gave no indication that closure was imminent. However, because of the IDA's serious concerns regarding the future of the company, the IDA requested local management to arrange an urgent meeting with the president of Liebert's European operations.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, as the Deputy is aware, the company announced its decision to close yesterday. Coming in the wake of the announcement of job losses in Apple and Bourns Electronics in Cork, news of the planned closure of Liebert is particularly disappointing.</P>
      <P>On a more positive note, two significant projects were announced for Cork last month. A £10 million IDA supported expansion plan for the healthcare company, Nycomed Ireland, Carrigtohill, County Cork, was announced which will create an additional 150 jobs. In addition, Siemens, one of the world's largest electrical and electronics companies, plans to establish a customer call centre, which will support the European market for the company's communications devices and e-commerce initiatives. This project will create 150 jobs over four years and recruitment has already commenced.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years 28 IDA backed projects involving more than £600 million investment have been announced and are under way in Cork. These projects have the potential to create 7,000 new jobs and more than 1,000 of these jobs are to be filled this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the IDA is to significantly upgrade <Col N="1122" /> its Kilbarry Business Park to improve and enhance its facilities and this will improve the prospect of attracting new investment into the area. The construction of a high quality 25,000 sq. ft. advance factory is also due to commence there shortly.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the IDA will continue to actively promote Cork for overseas mobile investment and that every assistance will be given to employees at Liebert to find new employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter this evening. I am disappointed the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Keeffe, is not present to reply to it, given that this plant closure will affect his constituency and that he has responsibility for the food industry. I take it he is working hard to ensure this company remains viable and that this plant reopens, or something to that effect. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for coming in to reply to this matter. I hope he will convey to the Minister my concern, and that of my constituents, about the closure of this plant.</P>
      <P>Universal Foods has announced it will lay off of 65 workers. However, vegetable processing is seasonal work. There are 90 people employed in this plant for 11 months of the year, 115 for eight months and the number increases to 172 at peak time for four months of the year.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the knock-on effect of this closure on the town and its environs, I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, is aware of the food-town concept. Other companies in the immediate catchment area will also be affected. In other words, from tea bags to toilet paper, the local economy has been dealt a body blow from which it cannot easily recover. The raw materials for this company are sourced locally. Ninety farmers are also affected by this closure and we all know the difficulties that face the agriculture community. Those farmers are relatively smallholders with 60 to 100 acres. What are they to do now? The timing of the announcement of this closure could not have been worse because at this time of the year farmers have to make decisions about area aid, extensification, etc. They have now been left in limbo.</P>
      <P>What happened to the early warning system? Why was this closure not anticipated? What did the Government do to keep this plant open? When a former Minister of State, Paddy Hegarty, was in the position now held by Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, he managed, in similar circumstances, to keep the plant functioning as a vegetable processing plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plant is the last one of its kind in the country. From now on we will import all our vegetables. Last year we exported £2,400 million worth of vegetables, approximately 4,000 tonnes, but we will have to import those vegetables in <Col N="1123" /> future. That reflects badly on an agricultural-based country.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed and angry that this company has to close. What has the Government done to try to keep it open and what does it intend to do now to ensure a similar type plant is located in Midleton to process vegetables including carrots, peas, French beans, swedes, cabbages, etc.? Those vegetables can be easily grown in the area and the local farmers are experts at producing them.</P>
    <P>Contractors, who have invested a good deal of money in expensive machinery to harvest these crops, will also suffer a major loss. For what other purpose will they use this machinery and how will they earn a livelihood? The closure of this plant is a body blow not only to my constituency but to the country. Instead of expanding this industry with value added products such as frozen vegetables, we are allowing it to be destroyed. The Government is presiding over the loss of the last such industry in the country and we will become totally dependent on imported vegetables. That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to convey to his ministerial colleagues that they must do everything possible to secure a replacement company to take over this plant. A good deal of money has been poured into this plant in recent years. It is a modern plant, but it probably requires further investment to make it viable.</P>
    <P>In the event that he fails to find a replacement industry, I ask the Minister to ensure the workers concerned are treated properly and given a substantial redundancy. This plant has been in operation for 35 years and many of these workers have been employed there for that length of time. Their skills are related to the industry and they will find it difficult to secure other employment in spite of the Celtic tiger. Deputy Allen pointed out that Cork has been dealt a body blow in recent times. What jobs can be offered to the farmers affected to replace the income they will lose? Farmers cannot get jobs in electronic companies. We might be putting all our eggs in one basket by concentrating on electronic companies. I ask the Minister to do everything possible to assist this company. I want him to tell us what the Government did in the past, and is doing now, to assist this company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While the subject of this question is not a happy one, nevertheless I am grateful for the opportunity which it affords me to reaffirm the Government's commitment to the horticulture sector in all its elements. This is evidenced by the fact that we have a Minister of State with special responsibility for the sector and a separate dedicated State agency. An Bord Glas, which has been in existence for nine years, is statutorily <Col N="1124" /> charged with responsibility for developing, promoting, and assisting the production, marketing and consumption of horticultural produce.</P>

      <P>More importantly, however, under the current Structural Fund sub-programme for the food industry, substantial Exchequer and EU funds have been provided to the sector. In the past four years, some £15 million in grant aid has been allocated to capital investment projects in this sector. It has also benefited considerably from assistance in the areas of research and development, marketing and promotion and human resources.</P>

In this instance, the effects will impact not only on the workers, their families and the local economy but also on the wider rural community. The Deputy can be assured, however, that the Department of Agriculture and Food is working, and will continue to work, closely with Enterprise Ireland to obtain an alternative enterprise for the Midleton facility. Towards this end, discussions are taking place on an ongoing basis, but at this stage it is essential, of course, that this process should not be prejudiced in any way. It is the intention of the Government to do everything possible to ensure that these discussions are brought to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for taking this matter but I had thought the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, or the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, might have taken it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day 30 April 1997 was a red letter day for people living in rural and isolated areas, when my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Howlin, the then Minister for the Environment, announced the <Col N="1125" /> details of a new grant scheme for private individual water supplies. This was part of a comprehensive package of measures to support rural water supplies and had, as its central thesis and aim, the provision of a water supply to those houses which did not enjoy the benefit of such a supply at that time.</P>
    <P>The main terms of the grant scheme were that the grants would be about 75 per cent of the approved cost, up to a maximum of £1,600; the scheme applied to households which were not connected or did not have the option of connecting to a public or group water supply scheme; and the grants would be available for works related to the provision of new supplies or the improving of existing supplies that were seriously deficient. Water supplies for domestic purposes to houses occupied as a normal place of residence would qualify. The qualifying works had to cost more than £500. Applications were to be made to the local authority for inspection, prior to the commencement of the work, and the scheme was to be administered by the county council. Those were the broad parameters of the eligibility criteria.</P>
    <P>When the scheme came into existence, the Department, in a cost saving exercise to limit the number of qualifying applicants, stated that a person is eligible for a grant if he or she is carrying out improvements to a seriously deficient existing pipe supply of water to a house, where the supply of water concerned is a supply other than a public or group water scheme. For the purpose of the memorandum, a group water scheme was defined as a scheme providing a private supply of water by means of a common or shared source of supply or distribution system. If the house concerned is connected at present to a public or group water scheme, it will not qualify.</P>
    <P>It appears from the advice the Department gives to local authorities, particularly to my own local authority of Westmeath County Council, that anyone who is receiving a supply from a neighbour at the moment is considered to be availing of a group supply and, therefore, is ineligible for assistance. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is a rural person, as am I, and he knows that often only happens as a courtesy &ndash; I am sure the same happens in Mayo. Indeed, this scheme is operated by Jim Ganley and the other officials in the Department of the Environment and Local Government in Ballina in Mayo. Those people have a good view of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The quantity and quality of water is extremely important for all aspects of life. The importance of a dependable supply of high quality water cannot be overestimated. Assurances as to quality and reliability of supply are absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>Until this new grant scheme was introduced on 30 April 1997, many people were not in a position to undertake the provision of a water supply. This grant was a recognition of the major problems that people in rural Ireland were having in providing a top class, reliable water supply. People might be surprised to learn that some houses are <Col N="1126" /> still not connected to any water supply and that some people still have to carry water in buckets from wells or rivers across the fields.</P>
    <P>The Department has engaged in a literal interpretation of the rules which is over strict and has resulted in clear hardship. People cannot be forced to co-operate in a group water scheme, as the Minister of State is aware. Group water schemes have been very important in the provision of rural water supplies, but there are occasions when it is not feasible to operate a group water scheme, especially in isolated rural areas. Furthermore, is it feasible to expect two pumps to work out of one well? Surely, that is an impossible engineering feat. The Department officials in Mayo know this is the situation. What happens if water is contaminated and becomes unpotable?</P>
    <P>Common sense must prevail over excessive bureaucracy in this area. I am sure that when the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, introduced the scheme, he never intended it to be fettered in a blur of restrictive interpretation.</P>
    <P>There were 342 applicants under this scheme to Westmeath County Council, 64 of whom were refused for various reasons. However, 25 per cent of the refusals were on the grounds that the applicants' current supply was from a shared well with one or more of their neighbours. They were advised to apply under the group water scheme if their current supply was deemed unsatisfactory in relation to quantity or quality.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State will give me the same reply, but the officials in his county of Mayo are very eager for this to be interpreted liberally. He should not let bureaucracy take over but should let common sense dictate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond to this item and has asked me to do so on his behalf. I welcome the opportunity to clarify matters with regard to the eligibility criteria attaching to the grant for the provision or necessary improvement of an individual water supply to a house.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will know that, responsibility for the administration of this grant scheme rests with the local authorities. It is, therefore, a matter for each county council to process and adjudicate on applications in accordance with the eligibility criteria laid down by the Department. The objective of the scheme is to assist households dependent on private individual supplies, who incur capital expenditure on providing a domestic water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme does not apply to houses to which a public or group scheme water supply has already been provided or can reasonably be provided. For the purposes of this scheme, a group water scheme is a scheme providing a private supply of water by means of a common or shared source of supply and distribution system. I note that the applications referred to by the Deputy <Col N="1127" /> were rejected on the basis of a shared source, supplying one or more neighbouring houses.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Deputy's own county of Westmeath, I understand the county council has received some 343 applications under the scheme to date. Of these, 64 applications were rejected, 16 of which were deemed ineligible on the basis of a shared source and/or distribution system.</P>
    <P>Two or more households served by a common source or distribution system are eligible for grant assistance in respect of the upgrading of the supply under the devolved group water scheme programme. Such households are not disadvantaged as a result of their ineligibility under the scheme of grants for individual supplies. In the case of a group application, a grant of up to £1,600 per house can be drawn down for each house in the group; this compares to a single maximum payment of £1,600 in the case of an individual supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> Last year, the Department of the Environment and Local Government provided more than £11 million for the development of new group schemes and the upgrading of existing ones. The Minister recently flagged a significant increase in capital spending for the year ahead, details of which will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that substantial capital resources are being provided for the rationalisation and improvement of group supplies, the Minister has no proposals at this time to review the eligibility criteria for the individual water supply grant scheme to accommodate shared ownership or shared usage of sources and equipment. However, I will communicate the Deputy's views on the inflexibility of the scheme to date.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. At the end of December 1998 there were 11,416 carers in receipt of the allowance at an annual cost of over £45 million.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance report, which was published in October 1998, I introduced a range of measures in the 1999 budget to improve the position of carers. Over 11,500 existing carers will benefit from the measures I have introduced while an additional 3,300 carers will now qualify for allowance. This budget package, costing over £18 million in a full year, represents a 40 per cent increase on existing expenditure and is a very considerable addition to the £45 million spent on carers in 1998.</P>
      <P>The review estimated that there are approximately 49,000 people in need of full-time care and attention. Of this number, almost 11,500 are in receipt of carer's allowance and this number is expected to increase to almost 15,000 following the package of measures introduced for carers in the budget. In addition, it should be noted that there are at least 2,000 carers (based on applications for the allowance) in receipt of another social welfare payment from my Department which is of greater benefit to them than the carers allowance.</P>
      <P>The complete abolition of the means test would cost an estimated £200 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The cost of extending the respite care annual payment of £200 to all full time carers would cost up to £8 million.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance examined the means test and considered that, in line with other social assistance schemes, it should be maintained so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. The means test for the carer's allowance has been eased significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of the earnings from employment of the carer's spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures I have introduced in the budget clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers, who enable people in need of care to be looked after in their <Col N="1130" /> own homes and communities, and the appreciation we must all have for this valuable role in our society. In addition, my colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Environment and Local Government have also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers. The Government is conscious that such a cross-cutting approach is required.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the reason there have been no increases in child dependant allowances since 1994 in view of the past commitments to introduce a basic income for children.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6437/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been widely recognised that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment, can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. This problem was highlighted in various reports, most notably the report of the Expert Working Group on Integrating Tax and Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The policy direction followed by the Government has, therefore, been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit. Unlike child dependant allowances, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment without any means test. In this respect it has many similarities to a basic income for children. However, I would point out to the Deputy that the Government has not made any commitment to introduce a basic income for children and there is no such commitment in Partnership 2000 or in the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
      <P>I should point out that this approach of improving child benefit, is similar to that pursued in practice by the previous Government. Despite the commitment in their programme to create a child benefit supplement, payable to all social welfare recipients and to low and middle income families, it never materialised.</P>
      <P>From September of this year, the higher monthly rate of child benefit payable in respect of third and subsequent children will have increased from £39 in 1997 to £46 while the lower rate, payable in respect of the first and second child, will have increased from £30 in 1997 to £34.50. This represents an increase of 15 per cent in the lower rate and 18 per cent in the higher rate over the two years and involves full-year costs of over £64 million in total.</P>
      <P>I should mention also that in 1998 we provided for the introduction of a new 150 per cent rate of payment in respect of twins at a further cost of over £4.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in the context of reducing disincentives to work, priority has being given to utilising family income supplement (FIS) as a means of <Col N="1131" /> increasing the net return from work to families with children. Accordingly, FIS has been reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis rather than on gross wages as was the case previously. This measure significantly increases the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work. The income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS have also risen, by £7 in 1998 and by a further £8 in June of this year.</P>
    <P>The level of these investments in the child benefit scheme and in family income supplement demonstrate our genuine commitment towards providing real supports for families with children, regardless of their employment status.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to the practice of some local authorities including family income supplement (FIS) payments in the income assessment for local authority differential rents is as I set out in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 106 of 2 February 1999.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the position is that from the point of view of ensuring that the full value of the FIS payment is retained by the claimant, it would be my wish that local authorities should not include such payments when assessing the level of rents payable.</P>
      <P>This view is reflected also in the report of the consultants who undertook a review of the disincentive effects of secondary benefits and other entitlements. The report recommends that this practice should be discontinued.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy will be aware that each local authority has responsibility for setting its own differential rents scheme, subject only to broad guidelines laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The question of excluding any particular type of income from rent assessment would have to have regard to the implications for local responsibility and its financial effects on authorities, including their capacity to carry out proper management and maintenance of their dwellings.</P>
      <P>While I recognise that the devolution of responsibility to local authorities for setting the terms of their own differential rents schemes presents some difficulties in seeking to achieve a uniform treatment of FIS payments, I intend to continue to urge that local authorities should exclude such payments from their income assessments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The carers allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. At the end of December 1998 there were 11,416 carers in receipt of the carers allowance at an annual cost of over £45 million.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's commitment to carers, as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, an overall review of the carers allowance was completed by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by my Department and launched by me in October 1998.</P>
      <P>The submissions and proposals of all organisations representing carers were considered as part of the review process and are comprehensively addressed in the report. The major issues raised by these groups were the removal or easing of the carers allowance means test, the introduction of a needs assessment and the provision of adequate respite and other healthcare services.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the review and its proposals on the improvement and development of the carers allowance, I introduced a range of measures in the 1999 budget to improve and develop the position of carers. Over 11,500 existing carers will benefit from the measures I have introduced while an additional 3,300 new carers will now qualify for a carers allowance.</P>
      <P>The budget package, costing over £18 million, represents a 40 per cent increase on existing expenditure and is a very considerable addition to the £45 million spent on carers in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the rate of the carers allowance will increase in June this year by £3 per week for recipients of the allowance who are under age 66 <Col N="1133" /> and by £6 per week for those who are over age 66. This represents an increase of 4.1 per cent and 7.9 per cent respectively on current rates.</P>
    <P>The review recognised that people with disabilities incur additional expense relating to living costs, equipment, medical mobility aids and care and assistance. The review examined the proposal to introduce a cost of care allowance and considered it to be within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. It is similar to the requests for a cost of disability payment which the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended should be introduced by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Issues in relation to VAT are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The review of the carers allowance also examined the means test and considered that it should be maintained as a way of targeting scarce public resources towards those who are most in need. The means test applied to the carers allowance is one of the most generous tests in terms of the assessment of household income.</P>
    <P>The review proposed the introduction of a PRSI carers benefit to facilitate carers in employment to temporarily leave work to care. The review envisaged that this could be financed through the PRSI system. The proposal would, for example, require a small increase in each of the current employee and employer PRSI rates. This proposal deserves further full examination and I would, for example, be interested in the views of the social partners in this regard.</P>
    <P>Looking towards the longer term, a further PRSI type arrangement in respect of people's care needs in the future was also proposed in the review. Given that there is a high probability that many of us will need some form of long-term care, such an arrangement could enable care recipients to meet some or all of the costs of their own care. The Government agreed, given the complexity of the issues raised, that this proposal should be pursued at both the policy and operational levels as a separate consultancy project and my Department will be progressing this later this year.</P>
    <P>The measures I have introduced in the budget and the additional proposals outlined above clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers, who enable people in need of care to be looked after in their own homes and communities, and the appreciation we must all have for this valuable role in our society. In addition, I should also say that my colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers. The Government is conscious that such a cross-cutting approach is required.</P>

      <Quest>the basis on which farm income will be calculated for the farm assist scheme; and if his attention has been drawn to the urgency of the implementation of the new scheme in view of the current crisis in agriculture.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The means testing arrangements under the new farm assist scheme will differ in two key respects from that which applied hitherto to low-income farmers who were claiming small holders unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>First, the scheme provides for the introduction of child-related income disregards of £100 for the first two qualified children and £200 for the third and subsequent children. This feature of the scheme is designed to target additional support to families with children.</P>
      <P>Second, all income from self-employment &ndash; both farm income and off-farm income &ndash; will be assessed at 80 per cent rather than 100 per cent as is the case currently under unemployment assistance. This is designed to provide claimants with an incentive to seek to increase their income from self-employment.</P>
      <P>The amount of income derived from farming is calculated by reference to the gross income from the farm less the expenses necessarily incurred in producing that income. These expenses include such items as fertiliser, veterinary costs, interest on borrowing for farm purposes, cost of hired labour, repairs to farm building and machinery, etc.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the need to bring the new farm assist scheme into operation at the earliest possible date and have taken active steps to ensure that this is done. As the Deputy will be aware, the legislative basis for the scheme is contained in the Social Welfare Bill, 1999, which is currently before the House. Once the legislation is enacted, I intend to bring the scheme into immediate operation, that is, with effect from 7 April 1999. To allow for the means-testing of new claimants, however, payments may not issue in some cases until the first week of June, but I would emphasise that any claims received by the end of May 1999 will have their entitlements back dated to 7 April.</P>
      <P>Where it is feasible to do so &ndash; for instance, in the case of existing claimants of small holders unemployment assistance who have been subject to a recent means assessment &ndash; it is intended to pay their increased entitlements immediately the scheme is brought into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general insurance contributions conditions which govern the award of unemployment benefit require that a claimant must have 39 weeks PRSI paid and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year, that is, in the last complete income tax year before the benefit year in which the claim is made. These conditions ensure that a person must have a reasonable recent level of attachment to the active labour force in order to secure entitlement to unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The EU Social Security Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72 co-ordinate social security schemes, including unemployment benefit, for workers, self-employed persons and their families moving throughout the European Economic Area and these apply to EU nationals coming to or returning to Ireland from the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide that, subject to satisfying certain conditions, the persons concerned can arrange to have UK unemployment benefit payments for which they have qualified paid to them for up to three months when they return to Ireland in search of work.</P>
      <P>Some may, on returning to Ireland, qualify for Irish benefit without reference to the EU regulations, if they satisfy the conditions for entitlement based on their previous Irish PRSI contribution record. In the case of persons who have insufficient Irish insurance to qualify for benefit, there is provision made in the EU regulations to aggregate periods of insurance or employment completed in other EEA states, as if these periods were completed in Ireland. The EU regulations, however, provide that aggregation of such periods can only occur in cases where the person was lastly insured or employed in the State in which the unemployment benefit is claimed. In Ireland this requirement necessitates the payment of at least one PRSI contribution in respect of the person making the claim arising from employment in this State.</P>
      <P>This requirement is designed to avoid situations whereby claims for unemployment benefit could be made by persons with virtually no attachment to the active labour force of the country where the claim is being made and who had previously paid little or no social insurance contributions in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no plans at EU level at present to change this requirement. Ireland has, however, consistently supported EU Commission proposals to significantly increase the current three months limit on the payment of unemployment benefit by the country of last employment to persons who move to another country to seek work. A proposal to increase the limit to six months is <Col N="1136" /> included in recent EU Commission proposals to simplify and update the EU regulations on social security.</P>
    <P>I consider that easing the current restrictions on the export of unemployment benefit by the country of last employment is a more effective and equitable way of addressing the problem referred to by the Deputy than removing the restriction on aggregation. It is also the approach favoured by the EU Commission, after much examination of this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible, and recognises that women who leave the workforce to undertake family responsibilities in the home may lose out in maintaining their social insurance record.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements are already in place to help people who work in the home to qualify for an old age contributory pension. From 6 April 1994, years spent out of the workforce caring either for children up to the age of six, increased to age 12 from 6 April 1995, or incapacitated people may be disregarded in calculating the person's yearly average number of contributions. The 1996 Social Welfare Act provided for an increase in the age of children being cared for from six to 12 years and this improvement was effective from the contribution year 1995-96. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded.</P>
      <P>In addition, new <i>pro rata</i> pensions were also introduced in November 1997 so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age contributory pension. A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent. To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions. This measure is of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after a child, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that more can be done in this area and, as the first step towards meeting the commitment set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, I have asked my Department to examine the issue in the context of a general <Col N="1137" /> review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. I expect this review to be completed in the first half of this year, and I will consider the matter further at that stage.</P>
    <P>The general question of pension provision, both Social Welfare and occupational, also arose for consideration in the context of the National Pensions Policy Initiative.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the initiative, the Pensions Board's report, Securing Retirement Income, recommended that secondary pension coverage targets also include specific targets for increased coverage of women in both employed and self-employed areas.</P>
    <P>In this context, the report envisaged that the proposed introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, would greatly facilitate the position of women with broken employment records due to childcare and other responsibilities. The working group, chaired by my Department, which was set up to progress the recommendation to increase second pillar coverage generally and which is examining issues relating to PRSAs, is making good progress. The outcome of their deliberations will be reflected in the comprehensive Pensions Bill which I hope to publish later this year or early in 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Both the back to work allowance and area allowance, enterprise, schemes have been very successful in encouraging the long-term unemployed to take up employment and self-employment opportunities. They form an integral part of my Department's employment support services designed to activate the long-term unemployed to leave the live register by providing financial support to help them make the transition to full-time employment or self employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Area allowance, enterprise scheme was introduced initially in designated partnership areas of high unemployment to encourage the unemployed and lone parents to undertake self employment. With effect from 1 January 1998, the scheme was extended nationwide, thus pro <Col N="1138" /> viding the samelevel of support to applicants for self-employment irrespective of where they live.</P>
    <P>All persons who have completed one year on the area allowance enterprise, progress automatically to the back to work allowance for a further three years. In effect therefore both schemes have already been merged.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, however, that the different names of the schemes may cause confusion. With the agreement of the partnership companies I have, therefore, decided to amend the name of the area allowance, enterprise, to the back to work allowance, enterprise. This scheme now involves a four year cycle of financial support available nation-wide to long-term unemployed persons and other welfare recipients opting for self employment.</P>
    <P>For person opting for employment the back to work allowance is available. Support under this programme is available for three years. Revised application forms and information leaflets to reflect this change will be available shortly in local offices of my Department and in the offices of the various partnership companies.</P>
    <P>The target group of both back to work allowances schemes is the long-term unemployed. This is the group who encounter the greatest difficulty in making the transition back into the active labour force and who thus need the financial and other supports which the schemes provide. Persons unemployed for less than 12 months are in a better position to obtain employment and do not</P>
    <P>require the same level of support or incentive to do so.</P>
    <P>The focus of the schemes will continue to remain on the long-term unemployed, of which there are still significant numbers on the live register. It is not intended, therefore, to reduce the qualifying period for access to these schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons in receipt of family income supplement is 13,594 as at the end of Feb<Col N="1139" /> ruary 1999. The Revenue Commissioners do not maintain comprehensive income distribution data by family size. This arises as the number of children which a taxpayer has is not relevant to a person's income tax liability except in cases where marginal relief applies. As a result a direct comparison between income tax data and data relating to family income supplement is not feasible.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to ascertain with any precision the rate of take-up of FIS. Research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1997, which was based on the results of the Living in Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants were actually in receipt of the payment. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the take up in expenditure terms was estimated to be somewhat higher at between 35 per cent and 38 per cent of potential expenditure. It should be noted, however, that the number of claimants has continued to rise in the interim &ndash; from 10,671 claimants at the end of 1994 to the current figure of 13,594 which is an all time high.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to take every opportunity to increase awareness of the scheme with a view to increasing the level of take-up. For instance, information on the scheme was a key component in the Government's information campaign launched in 1998, It Pays to Work. In addition, information on FIS is provided on child benefit payable order books and by the Revenue Commissioners when they issue tax free allowances. These measures ensure that information in relation to the scheme is available in every eligible household in the country. In addition, the scheme is extensively advertised through local and national media outlets, including newspapers, radio, and the Aertel service, as well as through poster campaigns and targeted mailshots.</P>
    <P>In order to enhance the value of the scheme by increasing the return from work, and in accordance with a commitment given in the Partnership 2000 agreement, I gave priority attention to reforming the scheme on coming into office. This included raising the relevant income thresholds and making provision for the assessment of income for FIS purposes on a net income basis, that is net of income tax, PRSI, levies and superannuation contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department administers a range of schemes and services which support individuals, families and communities in a wide variety of circumstances. I share the Deputy's concern about the possible underclaiming of benefits but can assure him that it is a matter of priority to ensure that people have access to information and advice, and also are assisted in every possible way to avail of appropriate benefits without undue delay where the need arises.</P>
      <P>The provision of information is seen as a primary service and an integral part of the ongoing development of customer services under the strategic management initiative, SMI, and my Department's customer action plan, 1998-1999.</P>
      <P>Consultation is the key to understanding the needs and expectations of customers. This consultative process includes customer surveys, customer panels, comment cards, and regular liaison with relevant organisations in the voluntary and community sector. Other proactive measures taken in the recent past included a seminar to identify the information needs of people with disabilities and discussions with the national adult literacy agency, NALA, to improve methods of communicating with people who have reading and writing difficulties.</P>
      <P>An extensive survey conducted in 1996 confirmed that there is a reasonably clear understanding of the role of the Department and a broad knowledge of schemes covering matters such as unemployment, sickness, pensions, and supports for families, including one parent families. In general, the survey concluded that there is a high level of public satisfaction with the operation of the system but it also reinforced the view that there is a constant need to provide information in a clear, comprehensive and timely manner to ensure that people are kept informed of their entitlements.</P>
      <P>Information on the full range of schemes and services is available at local level from the network of 57 social welfare offices and approximately 70 branch offices throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Details of new schemes or improvements to existing programmes are widely advertised using a suitable mix of media at both national and local level. This is supported by an extensive list of information booklets and leaflets detailing the essential features of each scheme and these are widely available.</P>
      <P>A proactive approach is taken towards informing existing social welfare beneficiaries of future entitlements, including the provision of information directly to unemployed people on possible education, training and employment options and advance notification of people as they approach the qualifying age for contributory retirement and old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also works closely with a range of organisations. These include the National <Col N="1141" /> Social Service Board, NSSB, which supports a network of 85 citizens information centres. Other organisations include the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, both of which receive funding towards the cost of maintaining and developing welfare rights and information services. Funds are also made available to a number of organisations towards the cost of developing innovative information projects for categories such as carer's, one parent families, pensioners, and people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the broad thrust of my Department's information strategy but I am continuing to examine ways in which an even greater level of public knowledge and understanding of the system can be achieved through the further development of the information services, particularly at local level.</P>

      <P>A large number of circulars and office notices are prepared and distributed as part of the normal work of my Department in the course of any one year. The majority of these relate to the administration of unemployment payments schemes, in respect of which a total of 86 circulars issued in 1998.</P>
      <P>These circulars contain guidance and advice on interpretation and procedural issues involved in the implementation of new schemes and the administration of existing schemes. Circulars issue in relation to existing schemes when changes and improvements are made or when it becomes apparent that an existing scheme is not being administered correctly.</P>
      <P>My Department has a duty of care to the users of its services to ensure that they are treated in a fair and equal manner, consistent with the relevant legislation, regardless of which office or official is dealing with their case. Circulars play a crucial role in achieving this.</P>
      <P>This issue of a circular to health boards last November concerning additional payments at Christmas was a straightforward administrative matter.</P>
      <P>The only debacle which occurred arose from the Deputy's mean-spirited, politically motivated and ultimately unsuccessful efforts to raise groundless fears amongst people in need so as to distract attention from the major benefits being provided in the 1999 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Deputy's efforts were at the expense of old age pensioners, widows, long-term <Col N="1142" /> unemployed and others who were misled into believing that this was some form of cutback. I made it quite clear at the time that the circulars issued to health boards had nothing to do with any cutbacks for the simple reason that there were no cut-backs, there are no cut-backs and there will be no cutbacks in this area.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the circulars was to ensure that all supplementary welfare allowance recipients received their full entitlements to additional payments at Christmas time in accordance with the relevant legislation, in a fair, equal and consistent manner regardless of which health board was dealing with their case. Health boards are empowered, and indeed are obliged, to make once-off payments to people who are faced with an exceptional need, including the additional costs which arise at Christmas time.</P>
    <P>They are also obliged to assess each individual's needs on a case by case basis. However, as the Deputy knows full well, practice evolved differently in the eight health boards, giving rise to anomalies, inequitable treatment of people in similar financial circumstances and a failure to make payments in some instances to people who were entitled to additional financial assistance. The circulars issued to health boards addressed these anomalies and ensured that the people concerned received their entitlements.</P>
    <P>From time to time, issues may arise, particularly where administrative discretion in decision making is required, which cause difficulties in that the application of standard rules may give rise to hardship for those affected. Accordingly, arrangements have been strengthened to ensure that issues which fall into this category are brought to the attention of senior management at an early stage to enable consideration to be given to the possible need for special measures to be taken in these cases.</P>
    <P>In this way, I hope to minimise the potential misunderstandings which may arise, particularly given the size and scope of the social welfare system. I also hope that this will minimise the potential for politically inspired mischief in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A copy of the national vehicle registration database is made available on microfilm to my Department, generally on a quarterly basis.

    <P>Following computerisation of the national vehicle registration database, consideration is now being given to developing an electronic link to allow access to the most up to date information.</P>

    <P>My Department receives each year copies of end of year, P35, returns of PRSI contribution data. This contribution data is used to determine eligibility for social welfare benefits and for control purposes. Over two million records are received each year from the Revenue Commissioners. There are no plans at present to develop an online link between the databases.</P>
    <P>My Department is also responsible for the issue of RSI numbers to people commencing employment and there is co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners in that regard. The Department receives on a regular basis information from Revenue on commencements of employment and this is correlated with information in relation to the social welfare status of the people concerned for control purposes and any follow-up action which may be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of and recognise the very valuable work undertaken by a whole range of voluntary and community groups in different areas of work and addressing different needs, including, for instance, community development, social services for older people, people with physical and learning disabilities, victims of abuse and other groups with special needs. The sector also includes groups providing youth services, community enterprise development groups and community education groups. Voluntary and community groups and organisations range from very large national organisations, with local branches throughout the State, to small-scale local and single issue groups. As well as meeting important social and other needs, <Col N="1144" /> such groups are an essential component of a modern democratic society and a key mechanism whereby citizens can participate in society in a structured way, either in terms of organising to address issues of immediate concern to them as individuals or their community and in terms of giving something back on a voluntary basis to society or to those less fortunate than themselves.</P>
      <P>As already announced, I am committed to producing a White Paper on the relationship between the State and the voluntary and community sectors. I anticipate that the White Paper will be published before the end of the summer. The White Paper will address a range of issues that have been raised in the course of an extensive consultation process undertaken by my Department with assistance from the other Departments and agencies concerned, including the support and information needs of voluntary and community groups at local level and how best groups can be encouraged to network and co-ordinate their work in specific geographical areas. However, I should say that the format of any support arrangements in this regard will need to take account of the diversity of the sector and the independence and autonomy of the sector, which, of course, is a vital part of its ethos and its role as a sector in civil society. In this light, the provision of statutory co-ordination would not appear to be the most enabling and appropriate response to the needs of local community and voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided that the local Government system and local development bodies should move towards an integrated local government development system, together with the public sector agencies and social partners involved at local level, which builds on the experiences and strengths of both systems. A task force, chaired by my colleague, the Minister for Environment and Local Government, has been charged with overseeing the implementation of this decision. The new arrangements will have implications for those community groups which have been involved in the Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development and other partnership structures and are intended to bring about improved co-ordination and greater cohesion amongst all participants in the local development process.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has recom<Col N="1145" /> mended that people with disabilities in residential care should have the same entitlement to an income as a person living in the community. At the moment people receiving disability allowance generally lose entitlement if they go into long-term residential care. Their maintenance costs and an element of pocket money are then met through funding from the health boards.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there are currently in the region of 5,300 people with disabilities in full-time residential care who are not in receipt of any social welfare payment. The full-year cost of paying disability allowance to this group would amount to some £25 million.</P>
      <P>Since the take-over of the disability allowance scheme from the health boards, a number of measures have been introduced to progressively relax this qualification. For instance, disability allowance continues to be paid for up to 13 weeks where the recipient goes into hospital. In addition, disability allowance is paid at half-rate in the case of those in part-time residential care.</P>
      <P>As part of the recent budget package, I announced another step in the direction of meeting the commission's recommendation. With effect from 1 August 1999, existing recipients of disability allowance will be able to retain their entitlement to the allowance where they go into hospital or residential care. However, this will not apply to people who will already have lost entitlement to disability allowance, having entered residential care before 1 August 1999. The legislative provisions relating to this improvement are contained in the Social Welfare Bill, which is currently before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>While the improvements in the residency conditions for entitlement to disability allowance which have already been introduced are of benefit to many people with disabilities, it is nevertheless recognised that much more needs to be done. In this regard, the potential for further enhancements to the system will continue to be examined in the light of the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board report, Securing Retirement Income, on the national pensions policy initiative, NPPI, was published in May 1998.</P>
      <P>As set out in the Government's response, Action on Pensions, published with the report, the Government broadly welcomed the thrust and recommendations of the report, in particular the board's target of 70 per cent occupational pensions coverage. To progress the main recommendations made by the board in the report, working groups have been set up as follows:</P>
      <P>(i) to examine fully the recommendation for an explicit mechanism to fund, at least partially, the future costs of social welfare pensions. This group is chaired by the Department of Finance and is therefore the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance;</P>
      <P>(ii) to progress the recommendation to increase Second Pillar coverage and the mechanism suggested for achieving this &ndash; namely, the personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs.</P>
      <P>The Government has accepted this recommendation, in principle and the working group, which is chaired by my own Department, is making good progress in its examination of the various issues. The group, for example, plans to turn its attention shortly to discussions with potential providers of PRSAs. It is hoped that the group will report this year;</P>
      <P>(iii) to further examine and advance the proposals to introduce a simplified and more flexible tax regime for pensions. This working group is chaired by the Department of Finance and is therefore the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance;</P>
      <P>(iv) to bring forward proposals in relation to an effective awareness/education programme. Again, the Government is supportive of the proposals in this regard. The importance of clear and easily understandable information in the pensions area cannot be underestimated. I have recently received an initial report on this for consideration from the Pensions Board.</P>
      <P>Each of the above groups comprises representatives of the relevant Departments and the executive of the Pensions Board. The outcome of the PRSA group's deliberations will be reflected in a comprehensive Pensions Bill which I hope to publish later this year or early in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect to make provision in this Bill for a number of other proposals from the board regarding occupational pensions including access, vesting, preservation and revaluation. In the context of preparations for the Bill, I will also be considering reports from the board in relation to the treatment of scheme surpluses, equal treatment, <Col N="1147" /> a pensions ombudsman and a compensation fund and the indexation of occupational pensions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The nationwide expansion of the family mediation service is a key priority in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium. This State-funded service offers a free and confidential service to couples who have decided to separate, helping them to resolve in a non-adversarial way the issues which arise on the breakdown of a marriage. Family mediation aims to assist couples to reach agreement on all issues in relation to their separation, including financial provision, the family home and property and parenting arrangements for the children so that ongoing close relationships with both parents is made possible for the children.</P>
      <P>The family affairs unit of my Department has responsibility for the Family Mediation Service. I am pleased to say that the nationwide expansion of the service is well under way. In addition to services in Dublin and Limerick, six new services commenced in 1998. The service is now available from regional centres in the south Cork, south-west Tralee, south-east Wexford, midlands, Athlone, north-east, Dundalk and the west, Galway.</P>
      <P>An extra £200,000 was provided in the 1999 budget to the Family Mediation Service bringing the total allocation for this year to £1.2 million, compared to an allocation of £300,000 in 1997. This additional funding will be used to continue the development of the service and to expand the service to other parts of the country. New services are planned for west Dublin and the north-west of the country by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance, UA, appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim UA. The rate of UA payable depends on the person's means. In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the family income supplement scheme was introduced in 1984 with the specific purpose of providing an incentive to low-paid employees with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the scheme to cover the self-employed has been considered on a number of occasions. Such consideration would have regard to a range of factors including: the practical difficulties associated with extending the scheme o the self-employed; the arrangements already in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes; and, the cost of introducing such a measure in the context of the need to prioritise the use of the limited resources available for the development of wider social welfare system.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a separate social assistance scheme is being introduced in 1999 to provide enhanced income support to low-income farmers. If FIS were to be extended to all other self-employed people, the costs involved have been estimated to amount to some £47 million, assuming substantial take-up.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, access to all social welfare schemes and services is available equally <Col N="1149" /> to men and women. It is open to any unemployed person therefore to avail of the range of back-to-work and back-to-education schemes provided by my Department, subject to meeting the general qualifying conditions.</P>
    <P>These schemes are designed to provide real supports to people wishing to re-enter the active labour market or to take up educational opportunities with a view to increasing their employability and enhancing self-esteem.</P>
    <P>On a wider level, the Deputy may be aware that, in accordance with a commitment given in Partnership 2000, a working group has been established to review the question of access by women to labour market opportunities with a view to improving gender equity.</P>
    <P>The working group is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Irish Farmer's Association, the Congress Centres for the Unemployed, FÁS, the Employment Equality Agency, Aontas and relevant Government Departments.

      <P>The Government has decided to establish a new agency, to be known as Comhairle, which will be responsible for the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services throughout the country. This new agency, which will operate under the aegis of my Department, will combine the current functions of the National Social Service Board, NSSB, with relevant functions of the National Rehabilitation Board, NRB. The necessary legislation is currently being prepared and I hope to publish this at an early date.</P>
      <P>This move towards a new integrated agency follows a Government decision to replace the NRB with a new National Disability Authority and to transfer certain functions to a number of existing agencies or Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The improvement of information and support services for people with disabilities was among the key recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The establishment of the new agency, Comhairle will ensure that services for people with disabilities will become an integral part of an enhanced mainstream information, advice and advocacy service for all citizens, and <Col N="1150" /> utilising and building on the resources and expertise of both existing organisations.</P>
    <P>The board of Comhairle was appointed in November of last year. In the meantime, pending the enactment of the necessary legislation, the board will act as the board for the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>This new agency will incorporate the resources of the NSSB and the relevant areas of the NRB and will support the provision of information throughout the country using the existing network of 85 citizens information centres and, as appropriate, facilities currently operated under the aegis of the NRB.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this new agency will not result in any diminution of services and indeed it is envisaged that the substantial progress in enhancing information services which has been evident in recent years will continue under the auspices of Comhairle. Details of the proposed relocation of the NRB staff to the receiving agencies, including Comhairle, the National Disability Authority and FÁS, to which existing NRB staff will transfer, are being finalised at present. Existing accommodation resources of the NRB will be allocated as appropriate to the transfer of responsibilities.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement, FIS, scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.</P>
      <P>An integral feature of the scheme is that, once the level of the FIS payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that level for a period of 52 weeks provided that the claimant continues to satisfy the conditions of the scheme. One of the qualifying conditions for the scheme is that the claimant must be an employee in remunerative employment for 38 hours or more every fortnight and which is likely to last for at least three months.</P>

      <P>My Department does not issue smoke alarms to old age pensioners living alone. However, my Department operates a scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Funding is not available under the scheme towards the cost of smoke alarms.  To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people must be: aged 65 or over; living alone or living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and unable to install or purchase the security equipment or alarm system themselves.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme grants are available for: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>Adult dependants are catered for in the social welfare system through the payment of qualified adult allowances where a spouse or partner is in receipt of a social welfare payment. Currently the qualified adult allowance is payable at approximately 60 per cent of the personal rate. The level of payment is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, 1986, and reflects the economies of scale which are considered to exist where two people are living together. This is the traditional way in which couples have been provided for under the social welfare system, not just in Ireland but in many other countries.</P>
      <P>In recent decades there have been many changes in the social and economic structure of our society and the social welfare system has sought to respond to these changes with the introduction of new benefits and allowances to cater for different needs and contingencies which have arisen.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the changes which have been made have given rise to what many consider are anomalies and discrimination in the system. In addition, the validity of the traditional method of catering for adult dependants has been called into question. It is considered by some that entitlement should not be derived from spouses or partners and that there should be more recognition of the very valuable role in society played by those who, for example, withdraw from the paid workforce to provide full-time care for their children.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental group, chaired by my Department, is currently examining the treatment of different types of households under both the tax and social welfare systems. The group is, among other things, charged with identifying and costing ways of ensuring consistent and equitable treatment of different types of household including married, co-habiting and one-parent households under both systems. The establishment of this group also marked the first stage in meeting the commitment in the national anti-poverty strategy to examine individualisation of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the group will complete its work in the next few months and we must await the report to see what measures are proposed before deciding on further action.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1998, provides, among other things, for the implementation of a number of key recommendations of the interdepartmental report on the integrated social services system published in August 1996. These include the standardisation of the revenue and social insurance, RSI, number as a personal public service number, PPSN, the widening of the use of the social services card as a public services card and the sharing of data between public service agencies for the purpose of determining entitlement to and control of certain benefits.</P>
      <P>At present, social services cards issued by my Department contain information on the person's name, personal public service number, date of birth, gender and numbers relating to the card sequence.

      <P>My Department has not as yet issued public service cards as provided for under the 1998 Act encompassing functions other than social security. A process of consultation has been initiated by my Department with other Departments and public bodies in order to determine the likely demand for a public service card. The public service card will be issued when the consultation process and planning process with these public bodies is complete. Likewise, detailed plans for the procedures and monitoring of the card are being developed in parallel with this consultation process.</P>

      <P>The group referred to in the Deputy's question applied for a grant for networking seminars under my Department's 1998 scheme of grants to locally-based community and family support groups. This scheme is one of a number operated by my Department which concentrates on a wide range of support for voluntary and community groups involved in programmes of self-help and personal development, designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and to improve family life. These provide valuable support for many groups dealing with difficult issues and problem areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> An application from the group referred to was approved in September 1998 and a grant of £2,000 issued on 13 October 1998. The scheme was again advertised in the national and local newspapers at end-January last, with a closing date for receipt of applications of 12 March. It is open to the group in question to apply again this year for a suitable project.</P>
    <P>However, I should emphasise that funding of services, whether for men's or women's groups, which are the responsibility of other statutory agencies is not available under my Department's grants schemes for locally-based community and voluntary groups. In this specific case, funding of services for victims of domestic abuse is the responsibility of the health services. However, there may be other aspects of the work of such groups that can qualify for assistance, as was the case with this group in 1998.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance. It is also available to certain people with disabilities and people under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. From April 1999, the scheme will be available to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides free travel on a range of services provided by the CIE group of companies as well as on the services provided by 73 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. At the end of December 1998, over 530,000 free travel passes had been issued at an annual cost of over £32.6 million. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included.

      <P>The estimated cost to the Exchequer of child benefit in 1998 was £418.7 million and the cost for 1999 is estimated at £447.5 million. An increase in child benefit to £20 per week for each child would cost approximately £661 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget provides for increases in child benefit of £3 per month for the first two children and £4 per month for the third and subsequent children, which will bring the rates payable from September 1999 up to £34.50 per month and £46 per month respectively. Some 520,000 families with a total of 1.2 million children will benefit from these increases.</P>
      <P>This substantial investment in child benefit, involving a full-year cost of over £40 million, was influenced primarily by the fact that the Government considers child benefit to be one of the more effective mechanisms available for the provision of child income support. It is effective in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to the main carers of children and is of particular importance to families on low incomes. As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc. it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>In addition, the income thresholds for eligibility to family income supplement were increased by £8 per week in the last budget. This will benefit up to 14,000 low income families with children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed in its action programme to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed. Specifically, the Government is committed to overhauling the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities and to implementing the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, CSPD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> In this regard, the CSPD recommended in relation to income support that the rates of payment as advocated by the Commission on Social Welfare, CSW, be achieved as a matter of priority. As a result of the improvements which have been provided by this Government, all payments to people with disabilities are now above the rates recommended by the CSW. Following implementation of the recent budget increases in June, payments for people with disabilities will range between 102 per cent and 124 per cent of the CSW's target rate.</P>
    <P>The CSPD also identified a number of shortcomings in the system of income support for people with disabilities and recommended the establishment of two types of payment: a non-means tested disability pension to be administered by my Department to cover loss of income due to an incapacity for full-time work, or to work to full potential; and a graduated costs of disability payment to be administered by the Department of Health and Children to cover additional costs associated with a disability. Underpinning the introduction of this payment would be the establishment of an assessment of needs procedure which would identify the full spectrum of services required by the person concerned from a range of agencies. These recommendations are currently being examined by the interdepartmental task force, which is preparing the Government's plan of action in response to the report.</P>
    <P>A number of the commission's principal criticisms related to the operation of the former disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme, now disability allowance, which in turn led it to recommend the establishment of a unified disability pension scheme. However, many of these criticisms have been addressed since the takeover of that scheme by my Department in October 1996. For instance, the commission found that the health boards differed widely in their application of eligibility and means testing criteria, while there was no appeals system. These problems have been addressed since the takeover of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Another area where the CSPD expressed concern was in relation to the perceived low level of take up. The improved administration, together with a number of improvements which have been introduced in the scheme since its takeover, have led to a significant increase in the numbers entitled to payment, up 37 per cent from 34,500 in October 1996 to 47,243 in January 1999.</P>
    <P>Other concerns expressed by the commission related to the disincentives to participate in education, training or work because of the lack of flexibility of the income support system and the withdrawal of allowances when people spend time in hospital or go into residential care.</P>
    <P>A significant amount of progress has been made by my Department in recent years in <Col N="1157" /> relation to the employment and educational supports which are provided for people with disabilities. For instance, the back-to-work allowance and back to education programme have been extended to people with disabilities. In addition, the amount a person can earn from rehabilitative employment without affecting their entitlement to disability allowance and blind person's pension has been increased to £50 per week.</P>
    <P>In relation to hospitalisation and residential care, a number of improvements have been introduced in recent years in this area which allow disability allowance to continue to be paid for up to 13 weeks where the recipient goes into hospital and for the payment of disability allowance at half rate for those in part-time residential care. In addition, the 1999 budget provides that, with effect from August 1999, existing recipients of disability allowance will be able to retain the allowance where they go into hospital or residential care.</P>
    <P>While many improvements have been introduced for people with disabilities in recent years, it is nevertheless recognised that much more needs to be done. In this regard, the potential for further enhancements to the system will continue to be examined in the light of the commitments in the Action Programme for the Millennium and the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and having regard to the available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>To date 19 checkpoints have been carried out under the programme of multi-agency operations, involving the Garda, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Environment and Local Government, the Revenue Commissioners and my Department. Their purpose is to facilitate checking of compliance with requirements set down in various Acts of the Oireachtas. Many instances of road traffic offences, vehicle defects, uses of illegal fuels, smuggling, tachograph offences, overloading and social welfare offences have been identified in the course of checking over 1,800 vehicles to date. In the case of social welfare compliance 118 fraudulent claims, mainly involving working and claiming unemployment payments, were discovered. In addition, a significant number of cases were noted for subsequent inspection or review. Some cases involving people who reside in Northern Ireland are being followed up through normal liaison arrangements with the Social Security Agency there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> My Department, early in 1998 accepted an invitation from the Garda to participate in these multi-agency checkpoints. The powers of social welfare inspectors are set out in the Social Welfare Acts and they include wideranging powers in relation to inquiries into social welfare claims. In the context of other necessary amendments to these powers proposed in the Social Welfare Bill, 1999, the opportunity is being taken to replace long-standing, more general existing powers with more specific powers appropriate to the ongoing operation of these checkpoints.</P>
    <P>The checkpoints have been a success over the past year and, my Department will continue to participate as long as they remain effective in addressing social welfare abuse. I assure the Deputy that the staff involved operate in a sensible, responsible and courteous manner, which minimises delays and fully respects people's rights.</P>

      <P>In line with its pro-family approach to the development of policy and services as set out in the Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government established the family affairs unit in my Department. The functions of the unit are: to co-ordinate family policy; to pursue the findings in the report of the Commission on the Family, published in July 1998 following its consideration by the Government; to undertake research, and to promote awareness about family issues.</P>
      <P>The unit has responsibility for support for the marriage counselling services and the family mediation service as well as a number of other family services including a pilot programme to provide improved service to families from local offices of the Department through the one-stop-shop model, and the introduction of an information programme on parenting issues. The family affairs unit comprises eight staff. It is headed by a principal officer. The unit has been fully operational since September 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate priorities on the establishment of the unit in 1998 were: the extension of the family mediation service; the implementation of a radically improved programme of support for marriage counselling services in line with the Government's &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach to the development of policies and services; publication of the report of the Commission on the Family, <Col N="1160" /> and follow up action to promote awareness of family issues.</P>
    <P>The nationwide expansion of the family mediation service is a key priority in the programme for Government. In addition to services in Dublin and Limerick, six new services commenced in 1998. The service is now available from regional centres in the south &ndash; Cork &ndash; south-west &ndash; Tralee &ndash; south-east &ndash; Wexford &ndash; midlands &ndash; Athlone &ndash; north-east &ndash; Dundalk &ndash; and the west &ndash; Galway. New services are planned for west Dublin and the north-west of the country by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This year the Government provided £2.1 million for voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services, child counselling in relation to parental separation and bereavement counselling and support services. In 1998, over 150 groups providing marriage and child counselling services received grants totalling £1.27 million. I extended the scheme to include the provision of marriage preparation courses and bereavement counselling and support services on the death of a family member. Some £230,000 was made available to organisations providing these services.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Family was published in July 1998 and widely circulated. At my instigation a series of family services information fora throughout the country has been organised by the family affairs unit. To date, fora have been held in four regions to coincide with the opening of the family mediation services. The fora provide voluntary and community groups who work with families at a local level with an opportunity to explore the findings of the Commission on the Family, to hear about the new family services in the Department and to discuss the issues they encounter in their work to support families. Further fora are planned over the next few months in Galway, Cork and Dublin.</P>
    <P>The family affairs unit undertook arrangements for the hosting by the Government of an important United Nations workshop on families and technology. Some 40 expert participants from around the world and from Ireland participated in the workshop. The report of the workshop will contribute to the preparations for the UN World Summit on Social Development to be held in 2000.</P>
    <P>Policy objectives in relation to a greater focus on family issues are also being promoted through the family affairs unit's participation at official level in EU and Council of Europe fora. Other family programmes and services at an advanced stage of development for introduction in 1999 include: a pilot programme building on the one-stop-shop concept with the aim of providing improved services to families locally through the local offices of my Department; a programme to promote awareness about parenting issues. This is being developed in consultation with the <Col N="1161" /> Department of Health and Children, and a programme to initiate and support research to inform the future development of family policy and services.</P>
    <P>The family affairs unit in pursuing its function to co-ordinate family policy and to pursue the findings in the report of the Commission on the Family is working closely with other Departments and agencies which share responsibility for the Government's programme in relation to policy development for families and children.</P>

      <P>Under the current statutory provisions governing the award of credited social insurance contributions credits, recipients of the carer's allowance may be awarded credits if they switched to that payment from another credit-bearing payment, e.g., unemployment assistance. In addition, administrative arrangements are in place for the award of credits to people who move directly from insurable employment to the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>As part of a wider package of measures for carers contained in the 1999 budget package, I announced that I would be introducing regulations to formalise these administrative arrangements so as to provide for the award of credits to claimants of the carer's allowance who have left insurable employment to engage in caring duties.</P>
      <P>I further announced that the two year rule, which decrees that where a person has no paid or credited contributions for a period of two years, he or she cannot be awarded further credits until a minimum of 26 contributions have been paid, will be waived in cases where claimants of the carer's allowance were in receipt of homemakers disregards immediately prior to claiming the allowance.</P>
      <P>The effect of this measure will be to protect the position of people who may, for instance, have left insurable employment in order to rear children and thus qualified for homemakers disregards, and who subsequently become carers after a two-year period has expired.</P>
      <P>Regulations will be introduced to provide for this measure, which will come into effect in April 1999.</P>

      <P>The increases in the thresholds which determine entitlement to family income supplement, FIS, have always been introduced in tandem with the general increases in social welfare rates, and in particular with the increases in the rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the purpose of FIS is to provide an incentive to low-paid employees with families to take up or remain in full-time employment. The increases in the FIS thresholds are therefore intended to ensure that, at a minimum, the incentive to take up or remain in low-paid employment is maintained, and where resources permit, enhanced. In that context, it is reasonable that these increases should be introduced in tandem with the increases in the rates of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The question of bringing forward the increases in the FIS thresholds to bring them into line with the tax year would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context. On a general level, however, I am of the view that the existing arrangements are reasonable and appropriate.</P>
      <P>I should mention, finally, that the 1999 budget provides for an increase of £8 in the income thresholds at each point, which will ensure that virtually all those receiving FIS payments will gain by some £5 per week.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 34 of 29 April 1998, Question No. 182 of 4 June 1998 and Question No. 745 of 27 January 1999 I have established a steering group, drawn from a range of relevant agencies and Departments and from the voluntary sector, with the following terms of reference: (1) advise on the consultation process with the voluntary and community sector, and with relevant statutory agencies in relation to the White Paper; (2) participate in same, that is, provide speakers as appropriate; and (3) mediate and comment on feedback and advise on issues and directions for the White Paper. The group has met on eight occasions to date and is planning further sub-group meetings to pursue issues in more depth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation process with the voluntary and community sector provided for a three phased approach. The first phase provided for information seminars and invited submissions from interested parties. The second phase <Col N="1163" /> involved a series of joint regional workshops for the voluntary and community groups and the statutory agencies. The final phase will provide for a national seminar to which people, who have been involved in the initial phases, will be invited to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in their discussion papers.</P>
    <P>The first and second phases of the consultation process have now been completed. In this context, 72 submissions were received by my Department and 53 regional seminars have taken place in different locations around the country. The final phase is now being planned. The steering group is currently developing a number of discussion papers reflecting the issues which have been raised in the first two phases of the consultation process. The national seminar which will be held shortly, will provide the opportunity for people who have been involved in the initial phases to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in their papers. Following completion of the consultation process with the voluntary and community sector, it is envisaged that the White Paper will be published before the end of the summer 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The back-to-work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as an integral part of my Department's employment support services designed to encourage long-term unemployed people to return to the active labour force.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides a weekly allowance of 75 per cent of the normal weekly unemployment payment for the first year, 50 per cent for the second year and 25 per cent for the third year and is available to those going into paid employment as well as self-employment. In addition, participants retain entitlement to certain secondary benefits subject to a household weekly income limit of £250.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the extension of the area enterprise allowance to non-partnership areas, introduced in 1998, effectively provides for a four-year cycle of support to those starting a business, with a weekly allowance of 100 per cent of the normal weekly unemployment payment available in the first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise also that, as well as the weekly allowance provided under the scheme, a range of additional supports are also available <Col N="1164" /> to participants on the scheme, and notably to those engaged in self-employment.</P>
    <P>For instance, an allocation of £1.2 million has been provided for the training and technical assistance fund this year which will be used to provide supports to self-employed scheme participants in such areas as book-keeping and marketing and to help finance the purchase of items of essential equipment</P>
    <P>Arrangements have also been put in place, in co-operation with the first step organisation, to provide access to interest free loans coupled with ongoing advice from qualified investors. Separate arrangements have been made with the credit unions to guarantee loans to scheme participants.</P>
    <P>My Department is in the process of commissioning independent analysis of a number of aspects of the back-to-work allowance scheme, including in particular, the sustainability of the self-employment enterprises created under the scheme. The question of providing for a special income support measure along the lines suggested by the Deputy will be assessed in the light of the outcome of this analysis. This assessment would also have to take account of the position of those engaged in self-employment generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to a strong social welfare pension based on social insurance, including the achievement of an old age pension rate of £100 per week by 2002.</P>
      <P>An important step towards achieving this objective was taken in Budget 1999 which delivered increases of £6 in personal pension rates &ndash; well above the average inflation rate and, when taken together with the improvements in budget 1998, represent an increase of £11 per week since this Government came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From June the weekly rate of the old age &ndash; contributory &ndash; or retirement pension will represent 124 per cent of the main rate recom<Col N="1165" /> mended by the Commission on Social Welfare, while the weekly rate of the widower's &ndash; contributory &ndash; pension will be 114 per cent. The maximum rate of both the old age and widower's &ndash; non-contributory &ndash; pension will be 109 per cent of the commission's recommended rate.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board, in its report entitled Securing Retirement Income, recommended that social welfare pensions should be increased in line with prices at a minimum and that it would be desirable to aim, over a five to ten year period, to increase social welfare pensions, to 34 per cent of average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>The Government has noted the recommendations of the board and considers that the question of increases in the rates of social welfare pensions and the PRSI financing implications of these will be examined in the context of the overall budgetary situation and economic climate.</P>

No. 303 of 1988).</P>
      <P>The 1979 regulations laid down national licensing requirements for retail and private petroleum stores. These regulations were developed to address the dangers which exist in relation to the operation of such stores. The sole purpose of the regulations was and is the effective control of the licensing of retail petroleum stores in order to prevent the risk of injury to persons or property conveying, loading, unloading and dispensing operations carried on in connection with such stores.</P>
      <P>Due to the fact that a considerable number of petrol retailing stations did not meet the necessary safety standards in respect of space, storage of petroleum and access for vehicles, the 1988 regulations provided an exemption until 1 December 1999, from a number of the 1979 regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority in conjunction with my Department has recently carried out a review of the above regulations. As a result of this review, I now intend to repeal the existing regulations and replace them with a new set of regulations. The new regulations will provide a framework of general principles and will be sup<Col N="1166" /> ported by codes of practice produced by the Health and Safety Authority. The approach will be based on a risk assessment of each premises which will ensure that necessary safety measures are in place. The new regulations will also impose general duties on petrol station operators to store and dispense petrol in a safe manner.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the new regulations and the codes of practice to support them are well advanced. However, further examination and consultation has still to be carried out. It is my intention to have the regulations finalised well in advance of the deadline of 31 December 1999.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the statutory body responsible for the promotion of occupational safety and health and for the day to day administration and enforcement of relevant statutory provisions in this area.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the authority that it does not have specific figures on the number of buildings containing asbestos material. One of the areas prioritised by the authority in 1997 and 1998 was asbestos, and they carried out over 100 asbestos related inspections in both years. These included hospitals, schools and other public buildings. In some cases, the authority served improvement notices requiring corrective action to be taken within a specified period, and in some instances prohibition notices were served banning worker access to potentially contaminated areas. During 1998 the authority also met with all known asbestos removal contractors and outlined the legal requirements regarding the removal of asbestos. A guideline on worker exposure to asbestos was also produced.</P>
      <P>I understand that this year, the HSA is again focusing on asbestos and plans to carry out a minimum of 100 related inspections. This will include inspections of buildings for asbestos installations, inspections of asbestos removal activities and of demolition/refurbishment sites. The authority has also planned three full-day asbestos related seminars with the objective of educating key persons and bodies and plans to produce a further publication on the issue for the information of workers who may encounter asbestos materials in the course of their work.</P>
      <P>There is no requirement to obtain a licence to import asbestos. The authority does not have precise figures on the quantities of asbestos imported in the past five years and I suggest the Deputy contact either the Central Statistics Office or the customs and excise division of the Revenue Commissioners for this information. I should point out, however, that the marketing and use of all types of asbestos with the exception of chrysotile, white asbestos, have been banned in this country since the mid 1980s. A proposal to ban white asbestos is currently being examined at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the authority has a preventive role in occu<Col N="1168" /> pational health and safety matters it does not process civil claims for workers who have contracted asbestos-related diseases. However, I understand that 19 asbestos related diseases were reported to the authority in 1995, four cases in 1996 and seven cases in 1997.</P>

      <P>Members of the Permanent Defence Force serve with a number of different missions abroad and different arrangements exist between missions in relation to the allowances payable.</P>
      <P>In general, personnel serving with peace-keeping, peace-enforcing or military observer missions overseas receive a daily &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; allowance in addition to pay, payable by the Department, in respect of service with such missions. Where personnel serving with peace-keeping, peace-enforcing or observer missions overseas are required to pay for accommodation and meals and bear other associated costs for the duration of the tour of duty, a mission subsistence allowance &ndash;<i>per diem</i> allowance &ndash; is also payable. In certain other missions where personnel incur all costs associated with service abroad, a cost of living/foreign service allowance, accommodation/ rent allowance, detention allowance, disturbance allowance and children's allowance may be payable.</P>
      <P>The current (1.7.1998) rates of the overseas allowance paid by the Department are:&ndash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, matters relating to pay and allowances, including allowances payable to members serving overseas, come within the scope of representation of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence <Col N="1169" /> Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA. It is open to the associations at any time to present a claim for a review of allowances which may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations. I would like to add, however, that the rates of daily overseas allowance payable to personnel serving with peace-keeping, peace-enforcing or military observer missions overseas attract increases in line with general round increases in pay and allowances. In this regard the overseas allowance has attracted increases under the terms of the PCW and Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>(a) The current strength of the Permanent Defence Force is 11,267, comprised of 1,305 officers, 97 cadets, 4,083 non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and 5,782 privates.</P>
      <P>(b) There are 1,136 retired officers and 5,235 retired NCOs and privates currently in receipt of service pensions; the numbers in receipt of disability pensions from my Department are 122 retired officers and 649 retired NCOs and privates.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 94 of 22 April 1998, there are closed down empty wards in addition to the 64 bed spaces in St Bricin's Hospital; the maximum number of beds the hospital can cater for; the progress, if any, made with the suggested pilot scheme to take civilian patients from another hospital; when this will commence; the reason for the delay; and, if, in view of shortage of bed places in other hospitals, all available spaces will be put into use without further delay.</Quest>

      <P>Thirty four bed spaces are currently available in St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin.  Another 30 bed spaces are currently unavailable pending completion of contracting work which has necessitated the temporary closure of two wards &ndash; this work will be completed in about eight weeks time. An additional 20 bed spaces will become available in the next few months, following the completion of refurbishment work to ward no. 1. When these works are completed, St. Bricin's Hospital will have 84 bed spaces available.</P>
      <P>The hospital also has an additional 30 potential bed spaces in ward no. 5. However, this ward is in need of very substantial refurbishment, including repairs to its roof. As sufficient beds are available for the admission of military patients, it is not proposed to carry out this refurbishment work at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I advised the House recently, a number of meetings have taken place between my Department and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, with a view to using St. Bricin's Military Hospital as a step down medical facility into which certain categories of civilian patients could be transferred. Agreement in principle was reached on the introduction of a pilot scheme under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods ranging from seven to ten days. If the pilot scheme is successful it is intended that a long-term arrangement involving up to 20 civilian patients at a time will be put in place. It was recognised by all of the parties involved that a range of issues would have to be addressed before the pilot scheme could commence and some preparatory work has <Col N="1171" /> already been carried out in St. Bricin's in this regard.</P>
    <P>Overall responsibility for the health and well-being of civilian patients in this country rests with the Department of Health and Children and it is essential that, in order to discharge its duties and responsibilities, that Department fully satisfies itself concerning all of the arrangements pertaining to the transfer, accommodation and treatment of civilian patients while in St. Bricin's Hospital. The Department of Health and Children has advised the Mater Hospital of its requirements in this regard, and it is understood that the matter is currently being pursued by the hospital authorities. A number of legal and insurance issues must also be resolved.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Health and Children has satisfied itself fully with regard to the above requirements, it will formally approach my Department to request that St. Bricin's Hospital provide the facilities described above. In the meantime, I remain committed to the successful implementation of the pilot scheme and the matter will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>

I sought and was successful in getting £200,000 in EU funding under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry towards the development of farriery training in Ireland over the period 1994-99.</P>
      <P>The first and most favoured option for the use of these funds is to allocate the moneys available to an organisation or organisations to assist them in establishing a formal farriery training course which would be independently certified, lead to recognised qualifications and command the general support of the industry.</P>
      <P>The current position is that two organisations, namely, the Racing Apprentice Centre of Education, RACE, and the Irish Masters Farriers Association, IMFA, have reached a working agreement on a project which includes the establishment of a farriery school at the grounds of RACE and the setting up of a register of farriers. This project will exhaust all available funds.</P>
      <P>Plans have been completed and RACE is in the process of seeking planning permission for the building. When functional, most likely in September 1999, the operation will be run by a new farriery authority which will be made up of representatives of the industry including RACE and the IMFA.</P>
      <P>With regard to the day to day running costs of the school, various bodies in the industry have already given commitments of financial support.</P>

The age declared on both the application form and card were inconsistent with the age registered by the applicant on the Bandon database. The person concerned was advised in writing of the discrepancy and since the animal was born in his herd he was obliged to have the appropriate form ER108 completed in his local livestock office and forwarded to Bandon to have the date of birth amended to coincide with his card. No response was received confirming that the date of birth had been amended. However, we have now made arrangements <i>via </i>the local livestock office to have the Bandon database suitably amended and a manual payment in respect of this animal will issue in the next three weeks.</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to Question No. 209 on 2 March 1999, a review of the scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to determining what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme. The existing medical criteria for qualification may be among the items examined by the group. While the review has not yet been completed, I should caution against raising expectations that any person who suffers from some form of disability will be admitted to the scheme following the completion of this examination. As was pointed out in the reply to the adjournment debate held on 2 March 1999, which sought extension to one particular category, large groups or categories have sought to be included in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have carried out a wide ranging technical review of the operation of the scheme and their report is awaited. However, this review is much narrower in scope in that it addressees problems with the present scheme and makes recommendations on how to make it operate in a more effective and cost-efficient manner for its present target group.</P>

      <P>The underlying principle in relation to the care of older people is to maintain them in their own home for as long as possible. I am conscious of the fact that one of the most effective tools in this area is the home help service.</P>
      <P>I am committed to developing the home help service as a key service in supporting dependent people in their own homes. Additional funding has been provided in the current year to bring the minimum rate of payment for all home helps up to £3 per hour from 1 April 1999. I see this as part of a phased improvement in the rate of pay for home helps. A sum of £1.5 million has been provided to extend the coverage of the home help service by providing more hours, as well as training courses for home helps.</P>
      <P>Following consultations with the chief executive officers of the health boards, my Department commissioned an examination of the future organisation of the home help service by the Policy Research Centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.

Under the terms of the scheme, the chief executive officer has the discretion to extend the scheme where special circumstances apply and the officer concerned has had two extensions, on this basis, which brought her sick leave up to the 8 November 1998. The Eastern Health Board has indicated that no further application for extension has been received.</P>
      <P>In relation to pension arrangements for the officer concerned, temporary officers may be entitled to a once off lump sum under the Gratuity to Non-pensionable Persons Regulations, 1984. Under these regulations, if a temporary officer has to resign due to permanent incapacity, they must have worked an aggregate of five years service, working ten or more hours a week, to qualify for a gratuity. In this case, the Eastern Health Board considers that the officer would qualify for a gratuity under these regulations. However, I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the officer has now returned to work with the board.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to allay any fears of parents of paediatric haematology patients undergoing treatment at the National Childrens Hospital at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I recently accepted a recommendation by the National Cancer Forum that all childhood cases of leukaemia should be referred for initial assessment to the specialist paediatric oncology unit at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. This was taken on the basis of best international practice. It arose from a recommendation to me from the forum, an expert body which advises me on the implementation of the national cancer strategy and related matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must emphasise that the only change to current practice will be that newly diagnosed cases will be referred for initial assessment and treatment planning in Crumlin. This does not mean that all cases would necessarily have to be treated <Col N="1183" /> in Crumlin. After the initial assessment, subsequent treatment, including chemotherapy, may then be delivered in the child's most appropriate local hospital, on a clearly defined and agreed share care basis, subject to proper supervision.</P>
    <P>I recently met with representatives from Children's Hospital in Leukaemia Drive and I reassured them that there would be no transfer of resources, whether equipment or staff, from the new unit at Tallaght. The decision made regarding cancer treatment will also not affect current services being provided for children at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>My Department has written to the Chairman of the National Children's Hospital setting out my desire for a structured collaboration between the three Dublin children's hospitals. In this context, I feel that it should now be possible to develop a positive agenda for improvement of paediatric services to which each hospital can subscribe.</P>
    <P>I would again emphasise that primacy must be given to the best interests of our sick children, including those requiring oncology and haematology services.</P>

    <P>The policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999, outline revised and updated procedures in relation to: improving the liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospitals and general prac<Col N="1184" /> titioners; ensuring a more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level through the appointment of an implementation group and a patient co-ordinator-bed manager in each hospital; improved management of out-patient waiting lists; and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Department of Defence and I have been advised that 34 bed spaces are currently available in St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin. Another 30 bed spaces are currently unavailable pending completion of contracting work which has necessitated the temporary closure of two wards. However, this work will be completed in about eight weeks time. An additional 20 bed spaces will become available in the next few months, following the completion of refurbishment work to ward No. 1. When these works are completed, St. Bricin's Hospital will have 84 bed spaces available.</P>
      <P>I understand that the hospital also has an additional 30 potential bed spaces in ward No. 5. However this ward is in need of very substantial refurbishment, including repairs to its roof. As sufficient beds are available for the admission of military patients, it is not proposed to carry out this refurbishment work at this time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of meetings have taken place between the Department of Defence and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, with a view to using St. Bricin's Military Hospital as a step down medical facility into which certain categories of civilian patients could be transferred. Both agencies agreed in principle to the introduction of a pilot scheme under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods ranging from seven to ten days. If the pilot scheme is successful it is intended that a long-term arrangement involving up to 20 civilian patients at a time will be put in place.</P>
      <P>It was recognised by all of the parties involved that a range of issues will have to be addressed before the pilot scheme can commence and some preparatory work has already been carried out in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has indicated its broad support for this proposal. However, there are a number of factors which must be taken into consideration. Principal among these is the need to ensure that patient interest is best served at all times. With <Col N="1186" /> this in mind, a number of legal and insurance issues must be resolved and clear protocols for the selection, transfer and management of patients must be established.</P>
    <P>I asked the Mater Misericordiae Hospital to prepare a detailed submission, setting out the arrangements for the use of this facility and I have received their proposals within the last two days. When these proposals have been fully considered within my Department, I will then be in a position to make a decision on the matter.</P>

      <P>The death grant was introduced in October 1970 to help families meet the costs of funeral expenses. The contribution <Col N="1188" /> conditions for entitlement to a grant were based on social insurance contributions paid after the date of introduction.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a death grant a person must have been insured since 1 October 1970.

      <P>I have recently announced changes in the death grant, which is being redesigned and upgraded by increasing the amount payable fivefold from £100 to £500; improving the coverage by easing the qualifying contribution conditions and extending the scheme to other PRSI contributors; and renaming the scheme to bereavement grant.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements will apply in respect of deaths on or after 2 February 1999.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment to carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. At the end of December 1998 there were 11,416 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance at an annual cost of over £45 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance report, which was published in October 1998, a range of measures were introduced in the 1999 budget to improve and develop the position of carers. Over 11,500 existing carers will benefit from the measures I have introduced while an additional 3,300 new carers will now qualify for a carer's allowance. This budget package, costing over £18 million, represents a 40 per cent increase on existing expendi<Col N="1189" /> ture and is a very considerable addition to the £45 million spent on carers in 1998.</P>
    <P>The review estimated that there are approximately 49,000 people in need of full-time care and attention. Of this number, almost 11,500 are in receipt of carer's allowance and this number is expected to increase to almost 15,000 following the package of measures introduced for carers in the budget. In addition, it should be noted that there are other carers in receipt of another social welfare payment from my Department which is of greater benefit to them than a carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by the Deputy are for the Department of Health and Children and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. However, the review of the carer's allowance carried out by my Department did note that there is an imbalance between the amount of expenditure on institutional care compared with the amount spent on community care. The evidence put forward in the review suggests that community care can be as costly, if not more costly, than institutional care where a proper and adequate range of services are provided. This is because the medical professionals involved are mainly dealing with people on a one-to-one basis, and it is also the case that many people who are being cared for at home, also spend a certain amount of time in hospitals.</P>
    <P>However, from the point of view of the carers, it is acknowledged that they do not view this in the same way, and they regard themselves as providing a service which the State should be providing.</P>
    <P>Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the State cannot, and would not wish to replace the personal support and care provided within the family and the community. Its primary role is to provide adequate support to carers and to those for whom they are caring, to enable them to remain in their own communities for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>The measures I have introduced in the budget clearly indicate my personal commitment and that of the Government to carers, who enable people in need of care to be looked after in their own homes and communities, and the appreciation we must all have for this valuable role in our society. In addition, I should also say that my colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Environment and Local Government have also brought forward proposals of assistance to carers. The Government is conscious that such a cross-cutting approach is required.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, grants are available for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door   chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems &ndash; such as the pendant or panic button alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the wrist or neck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this government came into office in June 1997, the multi-annual budgets for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 for this scheme had been set by <Col N="1191" /> the previous rainbow Government at £2 million in each year. In 1997, I requested the Government to increase this £2 million for that year by £3 million to £5 million and that was agreed. Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme last year I sought and obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.</P>
    <P>Since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1998 some 56,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. This means that since I came into office, this Government has spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. An independent review of the scheme has been commissioned by my Department in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>The final report from the consultants will be available at the end of March 1999. The future plans for the operation of the scheme in 1999 will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

    <P>Any development of the SWA rent and mortgage interest supplement scheme will be considered in the context of this report and the recent value for money study carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.

      <P>From September of this year, the higher monthly rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children will have increased from £39 in 1997 to £46 while the lower rate, payable in respect of the first and second child, will have increased from £30 in 1997 to £34.50. This represents an increase of 15 per cent in the lower rate and 18 per cent <Col N="1193" /> in the higher rate over the two years, and involves full-year costs of over £64 million in total.</P>
      <P>In addition, a new 150 per cent rate of payment in respect of twins was introduced at a further cost of over £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, priority has being given to utilising family income supplement (FIS) as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children. Accordingly, FIS has been reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as was the case previously. This measure significantly increases the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the various family benefits will continue to be developed in line with the Government's commitment to provide real supports for families with children.</P>

      <P>The 1999 budget provides for an increase of £3 per week (5.3 per cent to 7.3 per cent) in qualified adult allowances in the case of old age, retirement and invalidity pensioners and in the case of blind pensioners, where the qualified adult is aged 66 or over, and for an increase of £2 per week (4.9 per cent) in qualified adult allowances for other recipients. These increases, which will take effect from the beginning of June, 1999, represent real increases of between 2.8 per cent and 5.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments, including the level of increases for qualified adults, is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will consider more substantial increases in child dependent allowance with particular reference to payments of widows' and widowers' pensions where young families are involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the policy direction followed by successive Governments in recent years has been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit, rather than increasing child dependant allowances, thus ensuring that the sup<Col N="1194" /> ports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parent(s).</P>
      <P>Substantial additional resources have been invested in the child benefit scheme since this Government came into office. The full-year costs of the increases provided for in the 1998 budget amounted to some £28.4 million, while the 1999 budget includes a full-year provision of over £40 million.</P>
      <P>I would point out that, in general, the child dependant allowances paid to widows/widowers are higher than those which apply to the majority of other social welfare recipients: the CDA paid with contributory widows pension is £17.00, while widows in receipt of the non-contributory one parent family payment receive £15.20 per child per week. This compares to £13.20 per child paid with the majority of payments.</P>
      <P>It is important, too, to take account of the total payment to a family and not just the separate elements of it. For example, the increases which I announced in last December's budget will increase the total weekly payment (including child benefit) to a widow on contributory pension with two children by £4.38 per week (an increase of 3.6 per cent); the increase for a widow with four children will be £6.24 per week, an increase of 3.5 per cent. These increases represent a real improvement in the incomes of these families.</P>

      <P>Jurisdiction in wards of court matters is vested in the High Court. As the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, it is not open to me to intervene or comment on the conduct of any individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there are in excess of 180 applications for dismissal from wardship in respect of deceased wards waiting to be processed in the Office of Wards of Court. The time taken to deal with any given case depends on the issues involved, the nature of the assets and liabilities of the deceased and whether the affairs of the deceased were in order at the date of death. In the current circumstances, it is not possible to provide a detailed estimate of the average waiting time for the processing of dismissal applications. The Office of Wards of Court acknowledges <Col N="1195" /> however, that current waiting time for completion of some applications could be up to two years.</P>
    <P>In view of the current arrears problem in the office which arose because of historical staff shortages significant additional staff resources have been sanctioned at my request to eliminate delays in this area. Following the necessary consultations with the unions concerned appointments are in the process of being made. It is planned that this new staff when appointed will be assigned to address the arrears problem immediately on completion of the requisite training. While it is not possible at this stage to indicate a timescale for the elimination of arrears, I am satisfied that progress can be made within the next few months. In any event I have asked that a full review should be undertaken within 18 months. The target waiting time following the elimination of arrears is that there would be no delay in processing Applications in the Office of Wards of Court.</P>
    <P>While the prompt payment of accounts Act is not relevant to the situation in the Office of Wards of Court, I should point out that despite the fact that there are delays in processing substantive dismissal applications, payments are made as quickly as possible in respect of wards' debts such as maintenance and funeral accounts, probate tax etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two substance misuse prevention education programmes which have been introduced by my Department to schools, one at primary level and the other at postprimary level.</P>
      <P>The primary school programme, introduction of which commenced earlier this year, is called Walk Tall. The programme is supported by the provision to schools of detailed educational resource materials for each class level in primary schools and also by in-career development for teachers, which is provided in one-day school staff seminars. Other longer courses are being provided for teachers in education centres as the programme is introduced. Issues concerning the use and misuse of various substances are dealt with in the context of the general themes of self-esteem, feelings, influences, decision-making and drug awareness. These themes are developed in a systematic and structured way at each class level. Content is introduced in ways which are age appropriate and active learning approaches are advocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At postprimary level the substance misuse prevention education programme is called On My Own Two Feet and, like the programme at pri<Col N="1202" /> mary level, is supported by detailed educational resource materials and associated in-career development courses for teachers. The overall aim of the programme is to enable students to take charge of their own health and to make conscious and informed decision about drugs &ndash; legal and illegal &ndash; in their lives. The content is concerned with the broad themes of identity and self-esteem, understanding influences, assertive communication, feelings and decision-making. Information on drugs and their effects are integrated in these broad themes as are discussion of notions such as legal and illegal drugs, addiction and alcoholism, social effects of misuse of drugs and so on. Active teaching methods are advocated including role play, discussion, games, artwork, projects so that students may participate fully in the learning process. The programme has been taken up by 70 per cent of all post-primary schools since it was first introduced in early 1995. Substantial in-career development training for teachers has accompanied the introduction and this provision continues.</P>
    <P>An external, independent, evaluation of the development of these two programmes was carried out by Dr. Mark Morgan, St. Patricks College of Education and dealt with a comparison of how such programmes were developed in other European countries in the context of suitability of content and methodology, appropriateness of inservice support and immediate impact. The dissemination of the programmes include guidance for schools on within-school evaluation and review. These programmes will be subsumed in the broader programmes of Social, Personal and Health Education, SPHE, which will be introduced as part of the revised curriculum for primary schools and the SPHE programme for the junior cycle of postprimary schools when finally approved. The programmes will then be subject to the whole school evaluation process, which it is intended to extend gradually to schools generally after its pilot phase. The impact of the introduction of such programmes on general attitudes and behaviour will be matters which will only become clear in the longer term.</P>
    <P>One further initiative which will have an impact on the general curricula of schools is the dissemination of the outcomes and experiences of the Irish network of health promoting schools. This particular network has consisted of 40 schools, 20 at primary and 20 at postprimary levels. It has been concerned with promoting the health and welfare of all in the school community, with particular reference to developing a supportive school climate for health promotion, the introduction of SPHE to curricula and an active involvement of parents and agencies in the community. The network initiative has been evaluated independently by the Department of Health and Children promotion, NUI Galway, with positive outcomes in respect of these dimensions. The <Col N="1203" /> dissemination commenced recently, following a national conference held in February, and it is intended to continue the process of dissemination to schools at regional levels in co-operation with health board personnel. The dissemination will also be linked to the phased introduction of SPHE and will assist in preparing the ground for its introduction.</P>
    <P>Civic social and political education aims to provide a framework for the development of the pupils' personal and social confidence, to contribute to their moral development and prepare them for the responsibilities of citizenship. The CSPE syllabus aims to develop a concept of citizenship which extends beyond our national territorial boundary and includes the pupils' roles and duties as citizens of the EU and as members of the broader global community. There are four sequential and developmental units of study: the individual and citizenship, the community, the State, Ireland, and Ireland and the world.</P>
    <P>Some 300 schools will present students for examination in 1999 and the remaining schools will be involved at examination level in 2000. It is not intended to evaluate CSPE until at least one whole cohort of students have taken the course to examination level in the junior certificate in 2000, therefore, no evaluation criteria have been developed as yet. CSPE will then be evaluated as part of whole school evaluation, which it is intended to extend gradually to schools generally after its pilot phase.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive curriculum for relationships and sexuality education, RSE, has been developed for primary and post-primary schools by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment as a module within a broader context of social, personal and health education. RSE aims to promote the overall development of the person and the integration of sexuality into personal life. The RSE curriculum at primary level is divided into two main areas: Myself and Myself and Others. The study of Myself aims to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes concerning issues such as children's self-esteem and self-confidence, their physical, emotional and sexual development, their understanding and expression of emotions and feelings, and their ability to make decisions and to keep themselves safe and healthy. Myself and Others is concerned with the major relationships in children's lives: those within the family, within friendships and within groups. This area seeks to enhance the child's understanding of these relationships as they develop and to provide for the acquisition of important personal and social skills. The portrayal of male and female roles, the exploration of relationships and sexuality in society and the influence of the media are also included.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level, three main themes are covered: (1) human growth and development, (2) <Col N="1204" /> human sexuality and (3) human relationships. Theme 1 aims to cultivate understanding of the biology and psychology of the human life cycle from conception through birth and growth to death. This is accompanied by a rational for responsible behaviour in relationships and sexual activity. It also includes insights into physical well-being, infection and disease, including AIDS and sexually transmitted infections, STIs. Theme 2 deals with sexuality as an integral part of the human personality with biological, psychological, cultural, social and spiritual dimensions. Opportunities are provided in this theme to develop a holistic understanding of sexuality as contributing to the development of personal well-being, enhancing personal and family relationships and ultimately contributing to the well-being of society. Theme 3 focuses on the importance of relationships for health and well-being and stresses the importance of self-esteem as a basis for worthwhile friendships and relationships. It addresses issues such as communication, influence, intimacy, sexual attraction and sexual expression in relationships consistent with personal and moral integrity.</P>
    <P>Progress with the implementation of RSE is currently being monitored by my Department. As a first step, a questionnaire issued to all schools in November 1998. The final results of this work will be available shortly. In addition, an independent, external evaluation of the views of teachers, both primary and post-primary, and of parents in relation to RSE is being carried out by Dr. Mark Morgan, St. Patrick's College of Education. The evaluation report is expected in July 1999. The criteria against which the operation of RSE will be judged will mirror the overall aims and objectives of the programme. In addition, the views of children and young people with regard to the contribution of the school to their development in personal and social areas will be relevant in measuring the success of such programmes.</P>
    <P>In special schools, the curriculum covered in the various personal development programmes is based on that for mainstream schools. However, it is adapted by the schools to meet pupils' needs and levels of development. There are curriculum guidelines in the areas of social and personal development for schools for pupils with a moderate mental handicap. At present, the NCCA is in the process of devising curriculum guidelines for the different types of special schools. The work is concentrating initially on the development of guidelines for special schools catering for the different levels of mental handicap. Evaluation of these programmes is carried out by the inspectorate on their visits to schools. Criteria used are suitability of content and appropriateness to pupils' needs and abilities.</P>

      <P>Substitute teachers in primary schools are remunerated at two distinct rates of pay. The applicable rates are £70.04 per day in the case of qualified substitutes and £46.16 per day in the case of unqualified substitutes.</P>
      <P>Prior to my assuming office, the category of qualified substitutes referred only to fully recognised primary school teachers and all other substitute teachers were remunerated at the unqualified rate. However, with effect from September 1998, I introduced new provisions in this area whereby all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education have been recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service and are remunerated at the qualified rate.</P>
      <P>The reasoning for the introduction of the scheme outlined above was that it was considered that qualified secondary teachers should not be treated as unqualified for the purpose of substitution service at primary level. A person with the qualifications referred to by the Deputy would not be recognised as a qualified secondary teacher under the Registration Council requirements and would not come within the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>It has been the practice for a limited number of education centres to avail of the services of a relatively small number of private sector tutors to provide inservice training to teachers under the Teaching Skills Initiative, TSI, of the Schools IT2000 project. Payments to this group of tutors was approximately £20,000 in 1998.</P>

      <P>One of my key priorities as Minister is the establishment of a national educational psychological service, to be available to all schools at both levels. On Thursday, 11 February, I announced Government approval for the establishment of a national Educational psychological service. Financial provision has now been made for the first two years of a five-year implementation phase. At the end of the five-year period, it is envisaged that every school in the country will have access to a schools psychological service.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. It is intended that the psychological service will be an integrated service for the primary and second level sectors and, from now on, newly recruited psychologists will be expected to work in both sectors. My Department is currently carrying out a detailed analysis of the needs and resources available in all parts of the country, in order to set priorities for the expansion of the national educational psychological service.</P>

      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill, 1999, was published yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 29 sets out provisions relating to the delegation of authority from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council to recognised institutions to make higher education and training awards. Recognised institutions include <Col N="1207" /> the institutions established by or under section 3 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, which includes Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>Section 29(6) sets out that a review which has been, or is being, conducted on the direction of the Minister in relation to the delegation of authority to an institution established by or under section 3 of the Act of 1992 to make higher education and training awards, which following the commencement of the Bill becomes a recognised institution, shall be a review for the purposes of this section where the Minister so determines and the Minister shall inform the council, by notice in writing, of any such determination and may give such directions to the council and the authority, as he or she considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that, after the commencement of the Bill, I would direct the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the National Qualifications Authority to implement the recommendations of the report of the interim review group, chaired by Dervilla Donnelly. Thus, subject to the other provisions of the Bill and subject to the provisions of the Regional Technical Colleges Acts, I would envisage that Waterford Institute of Technology would have authority delegated from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council to make awards in relation to existing and new programmes at the level of certificate and diploma currently awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>

      <P>Support services are established for limited periods to provide inservice training for teachers involved in areas of substantial curriculum change. Following a pilot phase of inservice, a support service for CSPE teachers was set up at the beginning of the 1996-7 school year for a period of three years, finishing at the end of the current school year. To date, the support service has provided an extensive programme of high quality inservice and other support in a variety of ways for the teachers concerned, involving the application of substantial personnel and financial resources.</P>
      <P>The question of support for CSPE teachers following the end of the current school year, apart from the usual ongoing inservice which is provided on the basis of particular proposals from course organisers, is being considered at present in the context of the demands of the overall in-career development programme.</P>

As a result I am not aware of any lack of interest shown in the current syllabus by some students.</P>
      <P>Some 300 schools will present candidates for the CSPE examination in 1999 with the remaining schools participating in 2000. It was discovered that one school was not offering CSPE but this has been rectified. A support service of one national co-ordinator and six regional officers is provided by my Department to assist schools in this initial phase of CSPE.

The Holy Child Boys school had the services of a full-time caretaker under the 1979 scheme until his retirement on 27 October 1998. Unfortunately, as this school does not have the required number of teachers, i.e. 16 teachers, it is not possible to sanction the appointment of a full-time caretaker to the school.
