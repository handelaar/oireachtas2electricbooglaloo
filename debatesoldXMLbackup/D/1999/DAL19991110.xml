      <P>On Question Time yesterday the Taoiseach indicated that he would supply me with a list of his travelling companions on his visit to New York. I have not yet received the list and I wonder if the Tánaiste is in possession of it?</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children yesterday approved the Shatter report on tobacco and smoking. Does the Government have plans to extend the powers of the Joint Oireachtas Committee to compel representatives of the tobacco companies to appear before it? Given the success of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is appropriate that the Joint Committee on Health and Children be granted such powers. Will the Tánaiste indicate the position regarding the other legislation promised in respect of that committee, given that cross-party agreement has been reached?</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Owen's comments about the Joint Committee on Health and Children, there is a statutory sub-committee which considers the compellability of witnesses and makes recommendations to committees if it feels that such action is desirable.

      <P>Is the Tánaiste in a position to extract a definite date for the introduction of the immigration Bill? I ask this question because, despite assurances given on television yesterday by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, at 10.30 a.m. this morning the office in Lower Mount Street remained closed and there was a huge queue of asylum seekers outside. It seems that something is seriously wrong and, despite ministerial assurances, a large queue of people is spilling out on to the footpath, the office is closed and a service is not being provided. That is a reflection of the absence of a policy in this area. Will the Tánaiste use her influence to extract a date for the introduction of the legislation to the House in order that we can identify the nature of Government policy? Will she also comment on this morning's events in Lower Mount Street?</P>

      <P>The debate on the human rights motion has been adjourned for most of the year. I have tabled an amendment to that motion asking for the appointment of a Minister to co-ordinate immigrant issues. Will the Tánaiste consult the Whips and make arrangements to conclude that debate by the end of the year if time could be found for it, particularly given the recurrent problems faced by immigrants?</P>

        <b>:</b> Last night I emphasised the wonderful return we get from local radio and I welcome the removal of that levy by this Bill and that local radio stations will receive a share of £500,000 to help finance their organisations. It will be a major help to local radio stations, which have done a great deal in rural Ireland to keep the flag flying and make local news items available to everybody. I sympathise with many producers in RTE who receive a certain amount of stick because their listenership has decreased. RTE had a monopoly for a long time and had all the listeners it wanted but increased competition from local radio stations meant it could not maintain the same listenership. Everybody listened to its morning programmes in the past but RTE now competes with similar programmes on local stations and very often lesser politicians make wonderful contributions to these live discussions. I hope the RTE Authority will take note of that. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill. Broadcasting legislation in Ireland needs to be updated as the most recent broadcasting legislation to be enacted was the Radio and Television Act, 1988. The 1990s has brought fundamental change in the nature of broadcasting within Ireland and Europe. It is fundamentally about securing a balance between deregulating the television sector while, at the same time, ensuring that all viewers are entitled to watch television programmes of economic, social and cultural importance.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stressed already that the importance of public broadcasting is paramount as preparations are made to introduce digital television in Ireland. As she stated, it is vital that all citizens are given some basic guarantees, namely that the State must ensure, as far as possible, that all people have a guarantee of access to broadcasting services that have a distinctly Irish quality, reflect Irish values and are relevant, regardless of their economic circumstances. Such services must be provided on a universal basis or as near to that concept as is feasible.</P>
      <P>The Government believes the best way of providing that guarantee is through the maintenance of a strong public service ethos in broadcasting. There is a stronger argument than ever for broadcasting services, operating with a strong public service remit, providing programme schedules of quality and diversity and catering for minorities as well as mainstream tastes. It must be recalled that the Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty recognises that the system of public broadcasting in member states is directly related to the democratic, social and cultural needs of each society and to the need to preserve media pluralism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public service remit is currently defined only in a general way in the Broadcasting Auth<Col N="801" /> ority (Amendment) Act, 1976. There have been significant changes in the broadcasting scene in Ireland and across Europe. There will be a significant increase in broadcasting capacity, which will be brought about by the introduction of digital terrestrial television and the Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the system of public broadcasting in EU members states. It is, therefore, only correct and proper that greater clarity is provided as to what is expected of RTE in the fulfilment of its public service broadcasting remit and to similarly define the remit appropriate to the ethos and mandate of TG4.</P>
    <P>We must try and ensure real diversity and choice between broadcasting services. One of the objectives of the Bill is to put in place a regulatory structure that allows private sector broadcasting and public broadcasters to co-exist satisfactorily. Both sectors have much to bring to viewers and each sector can learn and challenge the other. While they have different objectives, both have an important part to play in the range of broadcasting services which can be offered to viewers.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly to the advent of digital television on our screens. The application of digital techniques is set to revolutionise broadcasting. The promoters of digital broadcasting radio and television have become the most powerful mass media ever devised. They have profound cultural and social effects at local, national and international level and are powerful tools for the dissemination of information and the education of public opinion. Broadcasting in its totality, therefore, is very much more than a commercial activity where the object of the exercise is simply to deliver the biggest audience at the lowest price.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to provide a structure for the introduction and regulation of digital television services from a broadcasting perspective. It deals with a number of these broader issues. It is intended to facilitate the introduction of digital terrestrial television &ndash; DTT &ndash; in Ireland. The Government will designate a company which will be licensed by the Director of the Office of Telecommunications to construct and operate the DTT infrastructure which shall comprise six transmission systems known as &ldquo;multiplexes&rdquo;. RTE will be a minority partner with a shareholding of 40 per cent. That entity will be mandated to build and operate the DTT infrastructure and promote the development of multimedia services and the information society. RTE's existing transmission function will be separated from RTE as a going concern and its equity contribution to the new entity will be met to the extent required by the value of these assets. Certain obligations will be laid on the designated company through the Bill and the licences, which the director will issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the name of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to be changed to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. It provides for this body to be given expanded powers and functions in regard to the regulation of digital broadcasting on all platforms &ndash; terrestrial broadcasting, cable and MMDS sys<Col N="802" /> tems and satellite &ndash; when entering into contracts with providers of broadcast content and drawing up codes and rules relating to the broadcast programme material, broadcast advertising and a range of other related matters.</P>
    <P>Section 10 enables the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to enter into digital content contracts with broadcasters for the production of programme material to be transmitted by digital terrestrial means. Section 11 provides that a designated company shall, if requested, enter into arrangements to transmit the analogue and digital free to air television services of RTE, TG4 and the television programme service contractor, TV3 and the sound radio services of RTE and independent radio stations, some of which are currently transmitted by RTE on a contractual basis.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the preparation by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland of the codes and rules to be complied with by broadcasters with respect to programme material. The commission, shall, following consultation with RTE, prepare codes in relation to programme material and other forms of commercial promotion. It shall also make the rules in order to promote the enjoyment of broadcast services by persons who are deaf or hard of hearing as well as those who are blind or partially sighted.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 3 for the abolition of the levy payable to the Independent Radio and Television Commission by independent broadcasters by virtue of paragraph 4 of section 14 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, will require that the commission must be funded from the Exchequer through the Vote of the Office of the Minister for the Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Accordingly, £2 million is provided in the Vote in 1999 for the running costs of the commission. The expanded functions of the commission will also give rise to an increase in staff numbers. However, the number of extra staff required has not yet been determined.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall also draw up a scheme for the disbursement by it of a fund of £500,000 provided from the Exchequer in respect of capital expenditure on transmission infrastructure incurred by local and community radio. This provision is only right and proper in light of the fact that local and community radio has been proven in recent years to be a total and real success. Local radio gives its respective licensing audience an opportunity to hear about developments in their locality as well as to contribute to various debates which are taking place on general local radio discussion shows. In this regard I welcome the repeal of paragraph<i> (b)</i> of subsection (4) of section 14 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, which enabled the Independent Radio and Television Commission to impose annual levies on the income of independent broadcasters. Now that this provision is being included in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, it will help ensure that more moneys will be made available for the operation <Col N="803" /> of local radio stations in Ireland. We all know the great success that local radio has been since its inception in 1988. We all know of the high listening audiences that local radio stations have built up throughout the country and this process must continue.</P>
    <P>I am confident the decision of the Government not to permit the Independent Radio and Television Commission to impose annual financial levies on the local radio stations in Ireland will assist in freeing up more financial resources and help ensure local radio stations prosper and continue into the future.</P>
    <P>In terms of promoting diversity in broadcasting I wish to refer to the changes which are taking place with this legislation concerning moneys which will be made available for independent television producers. One of the original provisions included in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, related to the fact that independent television producers had to be financially supported via the TV network administered and run by RTE. Section 4 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, continued this process. These were very innovative proposals and they have been proven to have operated in a very successful manner. They have ensured that RTE television produced programmes have been complemented by a wide range of independently produced programmes.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, recognises that this process must continue and, accordingly, an amendment to section 4 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, has been included in the legislation under discussion.</P>
    <P>In the financial year 1999 RTE shall make the sum of £16 million available for independent productions and in subsequent years this amount will be adjusted in line with the changes in the consumer price index. Under the 1993 Act the amount of moneys available for television productions was only £12.5 million. There will also be a Committee Stage amendment which will link the annual increase in the amount available to the increase in the RTE spend on television programme production.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 to 23 provide for matters relating to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. Section 18 provides for the appointment, remuneration, resignation and removal of the chairman and members of the commission and provides for a gender balance among its members. Section 19 provides for the supply by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of its staff, services, accommodation and facilities for the performance of its functions and for the payment of the expenses of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the grounds which exist for complaints to be made to the Broadcasting Commission in addition to the cases of breaches of codes regarding the taste and decency of programme material. This section also provides the <Col N="804" /> procedures for making complaints and the procedures to be followed by the commission in investigating a complaint.</P>
    <P>Sections 36 to 42 govern future legislative requirements for Teilifís na Gaeilge. Sections 36, 37 and 38 provide for the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a statutory corporate body on the day which the Minister shall appoint. Section 39 provides that the function of Teilifís na Gaeilge shall be to provide a national television broadcasting service catering for the expectations of those whose preferred spoken language is Irish or who otherwise have an interest in Irish. The service shall have a public service character similar to that provided for in the case of RTE by means of section 24 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Collins, for sharing time. I welcome the Bill and recognise that today young and old alike have daily access to information technology from bank machines to videos and from the Internet and e-mail.</P>
      <P>The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, sets out the legislative framework for the biggest evolution in broadcasting services, the invention of television itself, digital broadcasting. As the Minister pointed out in her speech, digital broadcasting will significantly improve the quality of television reception but, more importantly, will increase the capacity, flexibility, sophistication and types of service. More does not always mean better. The Bill attempts to ensure that digital TV is not simply about delivering the biggest audience at the lowest price.</P>
      <P>I welcome the basic guarantees in the Bill. All households have access to broadcasting services that have a distinctive Irish quality and reflect Irish values. We must protect the public service remit in broadcasting, otherwise we are in danger of creating TV that is no better than thrashy magazines. While commercial broadcasters have in the past provided a service, recent developments have not always been encouraging in terms of quality and range of programmes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill ensures the diet of cheap imported programmes will not constitute a good television station. Many countries in Europe and elsewhere have seen the service offered to them by purely commercial forces as a poor offering. The Bill ensures that real diversity, along with a capacity to cater for minority and mainstream tastes, will be maintained and put on a statutory footing. In light of this I welcome section 24 which will bring additional clarity to the public service in both radio and television. In this day of more we must ensure that some of that means better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision of £500,000 for local transmission infrastructure. We are all aware of the evolution brought out by the advent of local <Col N="805" /> radio. The service and diversity provided by local radio stations can be seen from their popularity in the ratings. Local radio has given local people a facility to tell their story, share their concerns and celebrate achievements together. These stations operate on a commercial basis, and as successful enterprises, paying their own way. The cost of providing for television would be greater. If there is a need to make more moneys available to local services that issue should be addressed. This would allow for national access, for which the Bill endeavours to provide. The funding should be linked to those who will best provide for local needs in terms of news, arts, culture and sport.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is welcome and in particular the provision which allows it enter into contracts with persons for the supply of programme materials for local interest channels being transmitted on cable and MMDS. This could be a very exciting development. At a time when localisation of trends is welcome, this new technology can make it possible for local communities to make their own programmes and broadcast their own sporting events on occasion. These choices will make the global choice capable of being more local and relevant. The world will come to the village and the village to the world.</P>
    <P>The £16 million reserved for independent productions and its subsequent link to the consumer price index is welcome. I urge the Minister to ensure this money is used to make programmes of a public ethos nature. It would be regrettable if independents were only encouraged to make programmes that were imitations of shows from other networks. While imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, we should try to ensure that programmes made from these funds will encourage excellence in drama, sports, features and documentaries. RTE, while providing a range of programmes, could do better when, as Brian Friel once said, we are talking to ourselves. RTE has been given a strong position in the Bill and I welcome this with a caution. Its track record in catering for minority interests and a variety of tastes is variable. Next week cross channel will see four comedy programmes with a large Irish input from people such as Ardal O'Hanlon, Dylan Moran, Tommy Tiernan, Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews. While these people's achievements are laudable, it is disappointing that they did not have a suitable platform for their talents through the Irish broadcasting service. The late lamented Dermot Morgan eventually had to turn to Britain to have his work produced for television. This is an indictment of RTE's record in fostering and promoting Irish talent. This is but one example of why we need to ensure the modest £16 million is used wisely and well, not cheaply and cheerfully.</P>
    <P>The reservation of a multiplex for broadcasting services in the North leads me to urge the Minister to encourage a reciprocal arrangement as a matter of priority. It is an important way of bringing together the many traditions on the island. <Col N="806" /> Television is a powerful medium which affects every home. It can be used to break down barriers, celebrate diversity and encourage understanding and pride in our achievements as a people.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge as a statutory corporate body. This is an important provision. Against some expectations, the station has made an important impact on Irish life. Its sports coverage, commitment to Irish music and drama as well as coverage of the recent DIRT hearings show how a creative approach can make a difference for a range of interests. Ensuring the survival of this important cultural institution is timely and welcome. Increasing to 30 the number of days for which a temporary licence can be granted for the broadcast of specialist programmes is also an important initiative.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on putting together this comprehensive Bill which will introduce huge changes in terms of the number of television and other services available while maintaining quality, integrity and diversity in the important national services. She has shown that we are embracing the possibilities and potential that derive from digital television and have the foresight to ensure the changes are dealt with confidently and assuredly with an understanding of what is important in an Irish context. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is the first major broadcasting Bill to be presented in over a decade. The Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, provided for the establishment of RTE as a statutory corporate body while the Radio and Television Act, 1988, provided for the establishment of independent broadcasting services. One would have thought, therefore, that after such a long period this would be a more substantial and comprehensive Bill but that is not the case. It has been introduced in a time of rapid and great change in technology and competition in broadcasting, especially from digital broadcasting services in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out the terms on which digital terrestrial television services will be provided which will also be available from cable and MMDS operators. The Director of Telecommunications Regulation, Ms Etain Doyle, will have responsibility for the technical aspects of digital television while the Independent Radio and Television Commission, to be known as the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, will have extensive powers to regulate the licensing process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new commercial partnership in which RTE will hold up to 40 per cent of the equity will manage and control the entire terrestrial television network comprised of six multiplex sections, each having five channels, one of which has been allocated to RTE while a second will be shared by TV3 and Teilifís na Gaeilge or TG4. As a result, the Bill focuses to a great extent on the promotion of a single media entity, that is RTE, and fails to encourage the emergence of an indepen<Col N="807" /> dent broadcasting sector or provide for the possibility of a community service.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for open competition. Legislation adopted in 1988 facilitated the introduction of competition in the marketplace by providing for the establishment of independent national television and radio stations. No corresponding regulatory framework was put in place, however, to regulate the existing national broadcasting monopoly enjoyed by RTE which is State funded. Its dominance will continue and as a result distort the marketplace. This is a major failure of the Bill. An ideal opportunity has been lost to level the playing pitch and provide a solid basis for broadcasting into the new millennium.</P>
    <P>The Bill confirms that the State subsidy to RTE, the licence fee, the revenue from which amounts to £70 million per year, is to continue without adequate procedures in place to ensure it is not used to compete unfairly with channels such as TV3 and TG4 which do not receive parallel State funding. This is unfair competition. This must be addressed if fairness is to be assured for the providers of services. A proper, open and transparent definition of &ldquo;public service broadcasting&rdquo; should be included in the Bill. Section 24(2)(a) reads:</P>
    <P>provide a comprehensive range of programmes in the Irish and English languages that reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island of Ireland and include...programmes that entertain, inform and educate, provide coverage of sporting and cultural activities and cater for the expectations of the community generally as well as members of the community with special or minority interests and which, in every case, respect human dignity.</P>
    <P>This seems to be intended to provide a bulwark against the European Commission in its attack on State subsidies rather than support more home produced programmes sought by audiences for which they pay a licence fee of £70. There is nothing in the Bill which will bring about changes in the current broadcasting regime which might lead viewers to expect an improvement in the quality of programming by providing Exchequer support for home produced programmes.</P>
    <P>There must be an external audit of the accounts of RTE, otherwise the <i>status quo </i>will continue. The director general should report to the Oireachtas annually if we are to have confidence in the commission. An RTE management report issued in June 1998 entitled Review of RTE's Structures and Operations &ndash; Report by Project Team concluded that the organisation would be capable of achieving a minimum reduction of 270 personnel and savings of at least £15 million. It appears that its conclusions have not been implemented. The recently published annual report shows an increase, rather than a decrease, in the number of personnel employed in RTE. It is difficult to discern whether any savings have been achieved as a result of greater efficiencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> This illustrates the importance of subjecting RTE to annual independent scrutiny by a third party based on a transparent definition of &ldquo;public service broadcasting&rdquo;. This would mean that the public service broadcaster would use revenues raised by way of the licence fee to fulfil its public service remit while any commercial revenues generated would be used to compete with others in the marketplace. This would ensure public service programming was available to viewers and competition distortions would be minimised.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to reform RTE. Why should it be involved with a holding of up to 40 per cent in the distribution company? Would it not be better if it focused its attention on its public service remit, producing and broadcasting Irish programmes for its viewers? Why should one indigenous broadcaster be favoured over another? Will TG4 or TV3 similarly be allowed to participate? I hope TV3 will make a greater effort to improve the Irish content in its programming. What will be the consequences if they are not allowed to compete on a level playing pitch? While the Minister has established a statutory corporate body for TG4, she has given support to a degree which will inevitably lead to its demise. It will be a long and painful death unless the Minister adequately provides at a later stage for the provision of resources to allow TG4 continue its excellent programmes in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State indicate if the existing Broadcasting Complaints Commission will be established as the new commission? The Bill states that the members of the commission shall be appointed by the Government. Does that mean the Minister, probably for the first time, is relinquishing her right to make the appointments? Who will be the Government, rather than the ministerial, appointees to the commission? What interest groups will be served on the commission? Transparency in the appointments will be important and there should not be any strictly political appointments over people who are committed to public broadcasting and who can make a professional input to the commission.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister retained the services of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission rather than subsuming its function into a new broadcasting commission of Ireland. This is necessary in view of the multiplicity of material which will be available, much of it possibly of a violent and distasteful nature. It would be unacceptable to have the new broadcasting commission act as a standard setter, complaints agency and final arbitrator. The Bill must give assurance of quality to the viewer at a time of invasion of the airwaves from abroad, but it does not give this assurance and it does not support Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record the important role local radio has played in Irish society over the short period of its existence. There is no doubt local radio has given local communities and groupings an important vehicle for expressing their views. It deals with local issues which would never be car<Col N="809" /> ried on the national airwaves or on television. Since its inception, Galway Bay FM has provided an excellent service in catering for all needs in the community. It has improved its professionalism to a standard where it ranks as one of the best radio stations in the country. The input at local level has given many people a greater opportunity to voice their opinions on issues of importance locally that heretofore would have been decided without such an input.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 53 of £500,000 in grant aid to local radio is welcome in one sense, but it must be seen as totally inadequate if local radio stations are to continue to develop on a level playing pitch. Local radio must be given additional resources by the Minister as an acknowledgement of the important role it has played in our society.</P>

      <P>Is Bille fairsing é seo le réimse leathan maidir le beagnach gach gné den gcraolacháin in Éirinn. Is beag díospóireacht a bhí ann faoi sa tír go dtí seo agus is ábhair iontais é sin mar tá sé ag ullmhú an bhealaí don réabhlóid is déanaí sa chraolacháin, an t-athrú is mó i dteicneolaíocht na teilifíse ón uair a fhionnadh í. Tá gá le reachtaíocht mar seo ach caithfidh mé a rá gur chaill an Rialtas deis chun reachtaíocht i bhfad níos fearr a chur ós ár gcomhair.</P>
      <P>This is a wide-ranging Bill that deals with almost every aspect of broadcasting in Ireland. There has been relatively little debate on it, which is surprising given that it is preparing the way for the latest revolution in broadcasting, the biggest change in television since its invention. Legislation is obviously necessary but the Bill is inadequate in many respects and the Government has lost a golden opportunity to bring a much better and more progressive Bill before us.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the debate on the key issues dealt with in the Bill has been so restricted. There is no widespread public understanding of digital terrestrial television. The new technology is not widely understood and less so the implications for what people will actually see on their television screens which, once costs are clarified, is what really matters. Our job as legislators is to inform ourselves on these issues, but we too are at a disadvantage in attempting to keep pace with rapidly changing technology. Most TDs, myself included, are doubly disadvantaged in this area and poorly qualified to legislate because, due to our heavy workloads, we see very little television.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on some aspects of the Bill. Probably its most far-reaching provision is the privatisation of broadcasting transmission. In its paper on digital television, published in March 1998, RTE stated it would not be able to control the national broadcasting transmission business in the future &ldquo;because of issues relating to domestic growth, deregulation and competition laws&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems the diktats of the market, as enshrined in EU and domestic legislation, which actively discriminates against public ownership, ruled out <Col N="810" /> even consideration of the retention of the broadcasting transmission network in public hands. This is yet another opportunity missed. As new technology creates a new world of communication, private companies and individuals are rushing to cash in, yet the State has been precluded from doing so by the actions of successive Governments. None of these companies will become involved if they do not consider a profit can be made, yet the public is denied the right to ownership of a network whose profits, once they come on-stream, instead of benefiting big business, could be ploughed back to provide public service broadcasting of the highest standards. I record my opposition to section 5 of the Bill on that basis.</P>
    <P>One of the buzz words in our increasingly commercialised consumer society is &ldquo;choice&rdquo;. This usually means quantity in place of quality. Does anyone consider that the increased number of TV channels which have come on-stream in Ireland in recent years has led to better quality programming over all? With the exception of Teilfís na Gaeilge, I do not believe new stations have raised standards, but quite the opposite. We have seen a dumbing down of television.</P>
    <P>This is all driven by the rapacious appetite of advertisers, an appetite which could ultimately spell the end of public service broadcasting, despite the provisions of this Bill. What is the effect of broadcasting driven solely by commercial greed? I compare it to a bus carrying an advertisement for designer clothes &ndash; or, God forbid, shirts. One day, the clothes company buys the bus and only allows it to be driven through streets where the advertisement will reach its target audience. The route is changed and the commuters who are not seen as consumers are left standing. That is the fate of much of the community, as far as commercially driven television and radio is concerned. Those outside certain age groups, social classes, cultures and geographic areas are not catered for in programming because the advertisers know that the take-up by such people of their products is minimal. This is, in essence, the &ldquo;Murdochisation&rdquo; of the media.</P>
    <P>Section 24 sets out the type of public service broadcasting that the new Broadcasting Commission is required to provide. It must &ldquo;provide a comprehensive range of programmes in the Irish and English languages&rdquo; which &ldquo;entertain, inform and educate, provide coverage of sporting and cultural activities and cater for the expectations of the community generally as well as members of the community with special or minority interests and which, in every case, respect human dignity&rdquo;. These are very laudable terms of reference, but they must be set against the record of RTE.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh na teanga Gaeilge de, is léir ní hamháin gur theip ar RTE í a chur chun cinn thar na blianta ach gur theip air fiú an t-íosmhéid Gaeilge a chraoladh ar raidió agus teilifís. Mar gheall air sin bhí feachtas fada chun Teilifís na Gaeilge a chur ar bun. Tá sé ann anois agus ba chéim mhór <Col N="811" /> chun tosaigh don Ghaeilge é nuair a bunaíodh an stáisiún. Tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé mar a thosaigh sé; is stáisiún are leith é seo agus ní cóir é a úsáid mar bhealach eile chun cláracha i mBéarla a chraoladh. Tá súil agam go mbeidh TG4 ar fáil ar fud na tíre leis an teicneolaícht nua. Níl sé, is mór an trua é, ar fáil go soiléir faoi láthair i mo cheantar fhéin ar an teorainn. Níl sé ar fáil sna Sé Chontae ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the supply of broadcasts from the Six Counties to this jurisdiction, but there is not any reference to provision of public service broadcasting from this jurisdiction to the north-east. Many people there are denied access to RTE and TG4. This is surely a totally anomalous situation, especially for the Irish language community there.</P>
    <P>One of the most positive developments in the Irish media in recent years has been the blossoming of local radio, especially outside the greater Dublin area. Local radio stations have galvanised the sense of identity in counties and regions and they provide a vital counterbalance to the domination of most of the media by mediocre mid-Atlantic culture. They truly serve the community. In saying that, I know I reflect the views of people in the north midlands and Border regions in relation to our local service, Shannonside/ Northern Sound.</P>
    <P>The whole area of community radio and television is much less well developed. We have about a dozen community radio stations. Local and community television have not yet been developed. The Bill gives legal recognition to community broadcasting, which is welcome. However, there are significant problems in relation to the definition of &ldquo;community&rdquo;. The Bill defines &ldquo;community&rdquo; in a geographical sense. Those working in community broadcasting are concerned that this could prove restrictive. Communities of interest on a broader level &ndash; for example, rural small farmers, environmentalists, the disabled, travellers and refugees &ndash; might wish to broadcast, and this should be recognised. This category of special interest broadcasting would allow, for example, the lifting of restrictions which have prevented United Christian Broadcasters from broadcasting. Community radio and television has tremendous potential to provide real public service broadcasting at grassroots level locally and among the many diverse sectors of our society. Its full potential is not recognised in the Bill, in particular, the need for proper funding.</P>
    <P>The Bill places the Broadcasting Complaints Commission under the auspices of the new Broadcasting Commission. I agree with the National Union of Journalists that this is unsatisfactory and that the complaints commission should be completely independent. This is a significant flaw in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I strongly oppose the retention in the Bill of the powers of the Minister under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act. This is the first <Col N="812" /> opportunity I have had since I was elected to this House to refer to section 31 in this Chamber. This measure gives the Minister the sweeping power to &ldquo;direct the Authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any particular matter or matter of any particular class, and the Authority shall comply with the direction&rdquo;. The orders under that section made by successive Ministers were applied by RTE in the most wide-ranging way, not only against spokespersons of Sinn Féin but against any person or group who expressed republican views. Members of Sinn Féin could not be interviewed on any issue or subject. There are many incredible examples of how this was employed. We were rendered non-persons by this measure. Even songs and poetry, some of which were the works of nationally acclaimed artists, were targeted under the regime of Government political censorship and media self censorship.</P>
    <P>Section 31 was an outright denial of democracy, deployed in the most cynical way by Governments involving all the parties in the House which have been in Government. It contributed to the political vacuum which, I emphasise, fed the conflict for nearly 30 years. It tried to deny the reality of British state injustice in the North of Ireland and it reinforced partition.</P>
    <P>At present, there are no orders under section 31 in force. However, this Bill retains in the hands of the Minister the power to ban anyone and anything from the airwaves at the stroke of a pen. This can be contrasted with section 24(3) of the Bill, which allows the Minister to change the terms of reference of the Broadcasting Commission in relation to public service broadcasting, but only after widespread consultation and the passing of a resolution by the Oireachtas. There are no such conditions attached to section 31. I put the House on notice that I will pursue my opposition to this aspect of the Bill at subsequent Stages and I intend to table an amendment for the repeal of section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960. I request all Members to support that amendment.</P>
    <P>Tá gá le díospóireacht leathan ar an mBille ní hamháin sa Teach seo ach ar fud na tíre agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé sin againn amach anseo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as ucht an reachtaíocht seo a chur os comhair na Dála. Is é atá i gceist leis an reachtaíocht seo ná bunchreatlach a chur in áit le gur féidir forbairt a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí chraolacháin in Éirinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During her contribution on Second Stage, the Minister dealt in detail with the provisions of the Bill, so I will make a few general points. We have to recognise that technology will bring about radical changes, a convergence between telecommunications, computers and broadcasting infrastructures, and will create a global infrastructure for the information society. &ldquo;Globalisation&rdquo; and &ldquo;convergence&rdquo; are buzz words which have <Col N="813" /> become part of our vocabulary. Digital broadcasting will be essential in providing a wide variety of services with a broad range of content. In layman's terms, digitalisation will allow for the provision of a large number of services and information.</P>
    <P>When we consider digitalisation it is important that we recognise the broader aspects involved in this revolution, in addition to its technical and economic elements. Digital terrestrial services have been introduced in a number of countries, including Britain and Sweden. To facilitate the early introduction of DTT in Ireland, the Bill allows for the creation of a new entity to build and operate the DTT infrastructure and to promote the development of multi-media services and the information society. The proposals being adopted by Government and reflected in the legislation are based on RTE's suggestions for the development of DTT in Ireland. Listening to the debate, it strikes me that some Deputies do not recognise that RTE is a State service and, therefore, it is right that the Government gives recognition to its proposals.</P>
    <P>A fundamental objective is the concept of universal service and it is important that DTT is made available to all. Access to the Internet and other interactive services are important public policy objectives as DTT has the potential to be an important delivery medium for information society services, particulary in rural areas. One of the opportunities provided by the new digital era, which is of particular interest to me, is that it will offer programme makers the opportunity to produce material using multi-lingual soundtracks. This is of great interest to those interested in moving away from a unilingual society.</P>
    <P>The new technology also creates other opportunities and it is important that it is used to benefit those who are physically disadvantaged. To this end the legislation proposes that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall make rules requiring broadcasters to take specific steps to promote understanding of broadcasting services by people with aural or visual impairments. The legislation envisages a quota regime which would see an increasing amount of programming being accessible to those with hearing and visual impairments. This is important as we need to take positive discriminatory steps to ensure that those who suffer such impairments are not excluded from programming or access to television services.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not solely concerned with the introduction of DTT, although we have to recognise that this will be one of the greatest revolutions in terms of the amount of services available. Another vital provision concerns public service broadcasting. I was disappointed today to hear an attack on public service broadcasting. There is a great emphasis on the private sector at present. I have nothing against that sector if it is willing to do those things we expect public service broadcasting to do. Deputy Ó Caoláin noted that experience elsewhere has shown that an absol<Col N="814" /> utely free market, with no element of public service broadcasting, results in a market servicing the maximum number of people in terms of advertising revenue and the lowest common denominator. I am a strong supporter of public service broadcasting as it is vital for the health of broadcasting in general.</P>
    <P>The protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty recognised that the system of public broadcasting in the member states is directly related to the democratic, social and cultural needs of each society and to the need to preserve media pluralism. In light of the significant changes in broadcasting in Ireland and across Europe, it is appropriate and necessary to provide greater clarity as to what is expected in fulfilment of the public service broadcasting remit which applies to RTE, and to similarly define a public service remit appropriate to the ethos and mandate of TG4.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá mar an tAire Stáit a bhfuil freagracht orm ó thaobh cúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta go speisialta, go bhfuil fíor-áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire tar éis a dhéanamh cinnte de sa Bhille seo go mbeidh deis ann anois Teilifís na Gaeilge a chur ar bhonn reachtúil. Sa chaoi seo tá comhlíonadh á dhéanamh ar ghealltanais a tugadh i gclár an rialtais. Mar a dúirt an tAire, sula dtiocfaidh seo i gceist, glacfar comhairle le RTÉ agus le comhairle agus le bainistíocht Teilifís na Gaeilge faoin am is oiriúnaí chun an chumhacht sin a fheidhmiú. Is é ainm an chomhlachta ná Teilifís na Gaeilge agus is féidir ainm ar bith a chur ar an tseirbhís nó ar an mbealach teilifíse. Mar a thuigimid uilig i láthair na huaire tá TG4 á thabhairt ar an tseirbhís sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go soiléir go bhfuil soláthar sonrach á dhéanamh do Theilifís na Gaeilge atá luaite sa Bhille seo, gurb é an t-ainm atá air ná Teilifís na Gaeilge, ag déanamh cinnte go mbeidh soláthar ceart trí Ghaeilge ar fáil do phobal na tíre seo ó thaobh na seirbhíse de. Ná bíodh eagla ar dhaoine faoi sin. Tá sé soiléir gur chuige sin atá sé ann. Tá sé fíor freisin go mbíonn cláracha á gcraoladh ag Teilifís na Gaeilge i mBéarla ach mura ndéanfaí é sin ní fhéadfaí ar na hachmhainní atá ar fáil na huaireannta sin a úsáid chun críocha cláracha trí Ghaeilge. Agus is maith an rud é go bhfuil an t-am saor á úsáid le scoth cláracha trí Bhéarla a chur ar fáil, mar shampla le seirbhís nach beag a chur ar fáil ó thaobh chraoladh an Tí seo. Ach is é an príomhrud agus an fáth go dtugtar airgead an Stáit chuige ná seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil. Tá sé ráite liom ag Teilifís na Gaeilge féin, aon rud a chuireann siad amach i mBéarla íocann sé as féin agus go bhfuil airgead iomlán an Stáit atá á chaitheamh ar Theilifís na Gaeilge á chaitheamh ar theilifís trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P> Tá airgead nach beag á chur ar fáil. Chuir an Rialtas deiridh é ar fáil agus tá sé méadaithe go mór ag an Rialtas seo. Chomh maith leis sin tá soláthar sa reachtaíocht go mbeidh ar RTÉ leanúint leo ag cur cláracha trí Ghaeilge ar fáil do Theilifís na Gaeilge. Tá dualgas faoi na hAchtanna craolacháin ar RTÉ a bheith ag cur amach clára<Col N="815" /> cha trí Ghaeilge idir raidió agus teilifís. Tá sin ann i gcomhnaí; is coinníol reachtúil é sin. B'fhéidir go raibh amannta ann gur cheap mise agus daoine eile nach raibh siad ag comlíonadh an dualgais sin ach ní shin le rá nach bhfuil sé ann. Tá mé cinnte go dtuigfidh daoine go bhfuil sé fíor-thábhachtach nuair atáimid ag caint ar sheirbhísí domhanda go bhfuil deis ann anois ó thaobh na féiniúlachta de déanamh cinnte go gcuirfear breis seirbhísí ar fáil atá dírithe ar mhargadh na hÉireann agus ar phobal na hÉireann agus i bhfad níos mó craolaidh áitiúla agus náisiúnta a dhéanamh.  Ag an am céanna beidh fáil ar sheirbhísí ar scála i bhfad níos leithne ar bhonn domhanda. Mar sin beidh an rogha i bhfad níos leithne. Tá sé de thuairim agam gur cheann de na rudaí a thiocfaidh amach anseo go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó aird ar rudaí áitiúla agus náisiúnta ná ar rudaí domhanda. Ainneoin gur féidir le daoine ar ghléasanna craolacháin raidió go leor stáisiún náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta a fháil is mó atá daoine ag díriú ar na stáisiúin náisiúnta. Tarlóidh an rud céanna, dar liomsa, maidir le lucht féachana teilifíse.</P>
    <P>Ach caithfimid a bheith cúramach. Go leor de na seirbhísí atá á bhunú ag lucht an bhrabaigh tá siad bunaithe ar an margadh agus ar airgead a dhéanamh. Mar sin, tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go gcoinneoimid súil air go mbeidh sé de bhuncheart ag an phobal teacht ar na bunsheirbhísí go náisiúnta agus go mbeidh siad in aisce.  Ba bhocht an scéal é dá mbeadh siad ar fáil ag daoine saibhre agus gan iad a bheith ar fáil ag gnáth-phobal na tíre. Mar sin, tá sé fíor-thábhachtach sa Bhille Craolacháin nua go leanfar ag tabhairt tacaíochta do sheirbhís phoiblí pobail.</P>
    <P>The new technology increases the need for broadcasting services to be organised according to a public service remit. I accept the argument that commercial broadcasting on its own would fail to produce a form of broadcasting which individuals or the public in general require and that while rules and regulations have the capacity to stop the undesirable, they cannot promote the desirable. The only way to counteract the deficiencies of a purely commercial system is through the existence of broadcasters &ndash; despite what was said earlier, TG4 is one of the public service broadcasters &ndash; which have the ethos of public service broadcasting as their driving force rather than purely commercial considerations.</P>
    <P>Turning to radio, I particularly welcome the provisions in the Bill which will assist that sector. The £500,000 which will assist independent and community radio services was mentioned. No mention was made of the removal of the requirement of the independent radio sector to pay a levy to the Independent Radio and Television Commission to meet its operating costs, which I welcome. The commercial local radio stations have taken on a public service remit and, particularly in rural areas as was mentioned by previous speakers, have certainly served the community well and provide a broad remit in terms of local current affairs, politics, matters of general <Col N="816" /> interest to the community and sport. In general they have provided a very good locally based service. It is interesting that those who have been the best in doing this have also attracted the biggest listenerships. While some broadcasters seem to think it is necessary to go to the bottom of the market to get an audience, local radio has proved that there is an insatiable appetite in the public for top class broadcasting and for current affairs and matters of public interest. I congratulate the local and community radio sectors in this regard. We are very fortunate in Connemara to have Raidio na Gaeltachta, an excellent service, and Connemara Community Radio serving north-west Connemara. Local and community radio have served the country well and have found a particular niche close to the hearts of the people in less urbanised areas.</P>
    <P>Ar deireadh ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire. Tá job mór le déanamh, nach bhfuil éasca. Tá cúrsaí craolacháin ag éirí an-chasta. ach is dóigh liom sa mBille seo go bhfuil obair an-mhaith déanta aici agus tá mé cinnte nuair a bheidh sé rite go mbeimid réidh le tabhairt faoi ré nua iomlán craolacháin sa tír agus go mbeimid in ann cothromaíocht a dhéanamh idir na riachtanais phoiblí, riachtanais seirbhís poiblí, agus an deis a mbeidh ag an airnéal príobháideach fáil níos gafa le cúrsaí craolacháin. Tá sé deacair scaití teacht ar bhealach cothrom le seo a dhéanamh. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil seo déanta sa mBille.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, tá fíor-áthas orm go bhfuil soláthar sa mBille seo le daingnú a dhéanamh ar bhunús TG4, go mbeidh sé ann go reachtúil agus creidim féin go rachaidh sé ó neart go neart agus go bhfuil seirbhís an mhaith á chur ar fáil ag TG4. Tá piantaí fáis ann ar ndóigh, ach tá sé ag dul i gcionn ar an bpobal agus creidim go mb'fhéidir gurb é seo an deis is fearr atá againn le tír fíor-dhátheangach a dhéanamh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few remarks on what is a very important Bill. By and large, no matter how much carping we do from time to time, relatively speaking the Irish television broadcasting audience over the past 30 years has received a quality service. There may be a view that perhaps certain essential public service commitments delivered by RTE nowadays are somewhat more tired than in the past, but by and large the national broadcaster has had a profound impact on the development of Irish society. For most of those 30 years we have had the opportunity to engage in high class electronic piracy and avail of the best available on the neighbouring island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that whereas digital television will offer more choice, the expectation on all sides of the House seems to be that more will be better. I am not sure this will necessarily prove to be the case. My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, when making his remarks on the Bill commented that providing an increased number of channels was not the only choice open to digital television. <Col N="817" /> Theoretically, going this route will offer greater choice, an opportunity to cater for minority tastes, programme specialisation and so on, however, quality of programming ought to remain paramount and could also be a casualty in this new era.</P>
    <P>I have not heard from the Minister an explanation as to why the Government chose DTT over cable and satellite. As I understand it, there is considerable evidence from other countries of a very low uptake of digital terrestrial television. I do not know what research was engaged in by the Government in coming down in favour of this preference. Was research carried out on countries of similar size and cultural background?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy O'Shea, set out some important principles which ought to remain paramount in any discussion of broadcasting. These included universality of availability, universality of appeal, provision for minorities, service to the public sphere and a commitment to the education of the public or, as Deputy Michael Higgins put it succinctly, the paternalistic, nonetheless sound, Reith principles of &ldquo;to inform, to educate and to entertain&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not persuaded that, in practice, these principles will be guaranteed in the new structures. The Bill attempts to strengthen the position of public service broadcasting and I welcome that. At the same time, however, the legislation is fundamentally weak in respect of State funding of this critical area of public policy. Take the example of TG4. Is the Minister satisfied that TG4 will be able to afford the commercial fees that will be levied by the designated company?</P>
    <P>This is a long awaited Bill. Essentially, it sets about facilitating the establishment of digital terrestrial television as, in effect, the only option for free to air delivery of television programme material. This will be achieved through the establishment of the designated company which will have wide ranging powers and functions under the Bill. Although the legislation sets out broad objectives for the company, it will be the same as any other company established under the Companies Acts. It will subsume the RTE transmission system as RTE is obliged to transfer its existing transmission infrastructure to the designated company in exchange for a shareholding in that company.</P>
    <P>The major shareholding will be held by a private sector investor, in all probability an investor with no involvement and, perhaps, no commitment to television production or programming. This is, effectively, privatisation. It is difficult to divine from the Bill how lucrative the new enterprise is likely to be. However, since the structure suggests that the designated company will, in effect, be an monopoly and that the licence system will stay in place, it is likely to be lucrative. Both TG4 and TV3 will be expected to pay carriage fees to the designated company. Is the Minister satisfied that TG4 will be able to pay <Col N="818" /> the commercial fees for transmission the new company is likely to charge?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give the House an outline of the type of fees anticipated as well as the estimates of the cost of DTT? What is the likely cost of the network upgrade? What is the value of the existing RTE network and is it fixed that the RTE shareholding in the designated company is to be equated to this value? What is the ballpark figure and can the Minister give us such a figure for the annual income to the company? Is there a ballpark figure for the new company's operating costs?</P>
    <P>The reference by the Minister to the possibilities provided for indigenous broadcasting puzzles me. Her office appears to be saying that we should speed this Bill through the House so RTE can be enabled to pay independent programme makers their £16 million before the end of the year. The Minister should clarify that. Under the legislation introduced by the previous Minister, Deputy Higgins, up to 20 per cent of revenue may go to independent producers. If my figures are correct, that 20 per cent this year is likely to be the equivalent of £19 million. I am not sure why it is being said that the speedy enactment of this legislation is a prerequisite to the payment of programme makers or why there is a £16 million ceiling.</P>
    <P>The reason I ask the Minister to give these figures is that we need to be able to make a rough stab at the profitability of the new enterprise. If we are correct in assuming that the new company's capital cost is roughly to be equated with the amount of funding to be raised by the new company, we should be told as much. RTE's stake will, I understand, be equivalent to the value of its existing network and there appears to be a nod in the direction of centralised billing. What does that portend for the future? What is the Minister's intention concerning future responsibility for collecting licence fees? All of this points in the inevitable direction of what we have seen across the water, high private sector salaries for executives and, down the road in a thriving commercially privatised entity, millionaire status, share options and the like. The Minister has made no comment on that.</P>
    <P>Is it logical or fair to assume the current commercial analog carriage fees can be used as a precedent in the new company's revenue estimates? What return does the public get for selling off the transmission network? Why is it not possible to reserve frequencies to meet the policy objectives of Government and other publicly funded initiatives? This policy would secure a platform for the delivery of free to air public service programme material at no additional cost to the public. My colleague, Deputy Higgins, referred to research carried out in New Zealand. It should be noted that New Zealand has adopted the approach I suggested. I instance here not just the case of TG4 but, for example, an Oireachtas channel offering the type of service envisaged in a paper I prepared last year for the Oireachtas broadcast<Col N="819" /> ing committee. It would be similar to the C-SPAN service in the United States.</P>
    <P>There is insufficient clarity of commitment in the Bill to the principle of universality and free to air. This should be elaborated in Part II. I welcome the attempt to strengthen the position of public service broadcasting but where is the funding commitment in this critical area? Despite the long time we have waited for the Bill, its definitions are old fashioned and traditional. They do not take into account the realities of modern broadcasting or future trends. One must look to the reports prepared for Government on the information society, for example, the report chaired by Ms Vivienne Jupp. The significance of Government as a player in the development of the information society is one of the themes running through those documents.</P>
    <P>I am not sure why the Bill seems to ignore the key role that converged broadcasting can play across so many social, industrial, educational and cultural policy areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, made a number of remarks about TG4, and I agree with many of them. It has been a breath of fresh air in many ways. I referred earlier to some tiredness on the part of the national broadcaster, but Teilifís na Gaelige, as it was called then, demonstrated a capacity for&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a good example of the innovation by TG4 to which I was going to refer. In respect of approbatory words expressed inside and outside this House on the DIRT hearings, the Committee of Public Accounts could be in Kildare House until this time next year and nobody would have paid a blind bit of notice to the proceedings were it not for TG4 taking the innovatory step to enable the viewing public to judge the process of examining why allegations of serious tax evasion were made, to see the people responsible &ndash; whether in the major financial institutions or major institutions of State &ndash; being questioned and to see their demeanour and hear their replies. The dynamic of television made the difference. TG4 led the way in that, as it did in the broadcasting of Question Time from this House, but there are other areas in which it has demonstrated a vitality of programming and novel approaches that has recommended it to a great many viewers, not all of whom are proficient in the first national language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the first national language, TG4 is probably the most significant development in the past 40 years. I am not sure what the Bill portends for its future. It provides that it may be estab<Col N="820" /> lished on an independent and statutory basis. It would be of great assistance if the Minister could be more specific and indicate a date as to when that will happen, but that, almost by definition, would involve certain funding impediments.  I am not clear there is a clarity of commitment that is necessary for TG4 to thrive. It requires a funding formula that will enable it to plan ahead and that is not provided in the Bill, as drafted. We cannot be certain of the future attitude of Digico in terms of the position of primacy it will have in the structures that are being set up under this legislation. Independence is the appropriate status for TG4 and in so far as there is a promise of statutory independence for TG4 in the Bill, I welcome it, but it can only grow and develop if it is master of its own destiny. My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, has drafted a large number of amendments for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will put a further question to the Minister that relates to the remarks I made earlier about the effects of privatisation, which is what we are engaged in here. Will the Minister consider, even at this late stage, retaining some spectrum space for public policy uses? More is not necessarily better. I do not know what programmes these 30 channels will broadcast, but based on the experience of the United States, many of them for much of the time will broadcast rubbish, trash that we would be far better off not receiving. We ought to retain the freedom to address that question in the light of experience and in the light of the evolution of broadcasting when the Bill is enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadcasting policy and the nature of broadcasting here tells us a good deal about our people. When we travel abroad and view the programmes presented in other countries, we get a feel for the life of the people of those countries. In some countries, one can only view what the Government wants to broadcast. One would see dour, dreary presenters poorly presenting dark news in countries like Iran. Such presentations do not give a sense of the culture or of the lives of the people of these countries. Local news in some countries is what happens on the local street and national news is what happens in the State, but they have no perspective on real national or international news and the peoples of those countries are deprived of that. I noticed that was the case in a country as advanced and as democratic as Canada.</P>
      <P>In other countries television channels seem to concentrate on games shows. That demonstrates a very frivolous people who are not able to find the balance between living in the never-never land and living in the real world. Other channels seem to concentrate solely on chat shows, which run from morning until evening, particularly in the United States. That demonstrates a people who are so concerned with navel gazing and sharing their embarrassing experiences that they are not really interested in problem solving. That is the danger of opening up our system to multichannels from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> If we, like other countries, depend on imports &ndash; I have visited countries where these type of systems exist &ndash; it would indicate they have no culture of their own, but we have been very fortunate in that we have had a very professional system. From the outset we learned from an excellent system, the BBC. We have managed to provide a cultural mix and, above all, the broadcasting service that has been offered here has allowed our people to develop from an insular, inward-looking people into an outward-looking people with not only an international knowledge but an international concern. That is recognised worldwide and much of the credit for that must go to our broadcasting service and system.  We have managed over the years to provide a balance between enjoyment and the serious and to provide a public service. In recent years, the system that traditionally was offered by RTE alone has been expanded to include other national radio and television stations, particularly local and community stations, and those which serve sectional and minority interests.</P>
    <P> As time and technology change and as the information age creeps upon us, it is timely that we should examine all our legislation on broadcasting so that we can respond to this change and rise to the challenge. I welcome this Bill which not only deals with commercial and technological interests but provides a challenge for us and for the people to balance our social, cultural, democratic, technological and economic interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the delivery of services of a distinct Irish quality in an age where there are hundreds of channels. These channels will undoubtedly be a threat to standards. I welcome the fact that Part III of the Bill deals with standards in broadcasting. We will soon open our doors to a multitude of channels where quantity does not mean quality and where it tends to balance out at the lowest rather than the highest common denominator in some countries. For that reason, the standards imposed in this Bill must be met.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the new Broadcasting Commission must establish a code specifying standards to be complied with and rules and practices to be observed in respect of the taste and decency of programme material. Taste and decency are words which sum up what is needed by the people in our new service. It will allow for the continuation of a sound broadcasting service, particularly in respect of the portrayal of violence and sexual conduct in such material.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the level of violence portrayed on our screens at all times of the day. Violence is glorified and gratuitous in many programmes. Violence and death are included in children's programmes and are seen as entertainment. It is not right that almost every programme on television should carry a &ldquo;V&rdquo; sign for violence. I am not sure if a definitive study has been carried out on the effects of such violence on children in their formative years. Surely we should question what purpose it has in such programmes. Must <Col N="822" /> everything be exterminated for a commercial reason and, if so, should we pursue that policy?</P>
    <P>The code will also deal with sexual conduct. Over the past couple of days I had the misfortune to change my television to a recognised British channel at approximately 9.30 p.m. or 10 p.m., which is determined as adult viewing but is not late viewing, and I saw a programme which offended my sensibilities. It was entitled &ldquo;Eurotrash&rdquo; and it outlines the worst of what is happening in each European country. This programme, which commemorated the fall of the Berlin Wall, did not tell us about the best aspects of East Germany but about its worst aspects in a most offensive manner. I do not want to see such broadcasting on State or recognised and easily available channels. We need to show our people the best of what is happening in the world. I do not know if there is a similar programme called &ldquo;Eurobest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The same can be said about advertising and a section in this Bill on standards in broadcasting deals with that issue. I welcome the fact the amount of time spent on advertising in any one day and the maximum period per hour can be controlled. It is timely and opportune that we should look at the amount of money and time spent from October until December advertising expensive Christmas toys on children's television. The focus during children's programmes early on Saturday mornings is on pressurising children to put pressure on parents to buy expensive toys. I spoke earlier this week about the early advent of Santa and Christmas, but such broadcasting and advertising needs to be questioned. We lower our standards to crass commercialism when we use advertising to put pressure on children.</P>
    <P>I have also noticed in advertisements over the past few weeks a tendency to play on unacceptable language. I refer specifically to washing powder advertisements where it is hilarious if a child has a stutter, a stammer or a lisp which means they are unable to pronounce some words which would not be acceptable in normal language but which are suddenly acceptable in an advertisement. I hope the advertising standards set down in this Bill will ensure that language, sexual conduct and violence are looked at seriously. One of the ways this will be done is through the membership of the commission. I welcome the fact that three men and three women will be appointed to it. This will allow a balance of gender and, I hope, of age on the commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill will ensure that steps are taken to promote the understanding and enjoyment of persons who are deaf or hard of hearing. We are not properly serving those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Some pre-recorded programmes provide subtitles, but many people, who are hard of hearing, are interested in current affairs and the news. However, our national broadcasting service does not provide subtitles for the news any day of the week. This should be done in the interests of these people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> The Bill specifically mentions the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament in relation to the RTE authority. However, I wonder about the quality of the current affairs programmes presented on our national airwaves in recent years, which have been reduced to shrill shouting shops. I am not just talking about politicians. The prejudice of the presenters is now coming across clearly. A five or ten minute film strip, which shows us the views of the presenter, is often followed by a person from the Government or Opposition trying to explain their position in two minutes. Few programmes allow for a proper discussion or for any politician to be able to present their views to the people. This happens from early morning on the radio to prime time viewing at night.</P>
    <P>The style of interviewing now being adopted was abandoned in England in the mid 1960s as being too aggressive and non-productive. One of the few programmes which allows a full discussion and issues to be teased out is &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo;. However, that is the exception rather than the rule. By being too aggressive and by demeaning politicians &ndash; sometimes we add to that ourselves &ndash; a proper public service is not being provided and then we wonder why the people are apathetic about us.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill states that the duty of programmers and of the authority shall be to provide programmes which entertain, inform and educate, provide coverage of sporting and cultural activities and cater for the expectations of the community generally, as well as members of the community with special or minority interests, and which in every case respect human dignity. The human dignity of all people is not always respected at different levels of broadcasting. The minority and special interests are well catered for on local radio.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that all these groups are now being brought under this legislation and I welcome the new technology and licences which are available to them. The criteria should remain quite strict.</P>
    <P>Dublin does not have the same service as counties served by stations such as Louth-Meath Radio, Tipp FM or Kerry Radio. Dublin radio stations tend to be pop-orientated and while they give very good snappy news bulletins, they carry no real local stories or programmes. I question their commitment to the Irish language and to current affairs. I do not suggest that there should be specific stations in the Dublin area dealing solely with matters of local interest but that the balance should be more evident throughout the stations.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to teleshopping which is new to this country although we have seen it on other channels in other countries. In this area the standard which is adopted at the outset is the one which will continue. I know of people who have been sucked into buying goods about which false or exaggerated statements were made on shop<Col N="824" /> ping channels. From the outset we must establish what can be sold, who the seller will be and how it shall be promoted.</P>
    <P>Bhí an-áthas orm a fheiscint ins an mBille go bhfuil TG4 chun a neamhspleáchas a fháil. Gan aon amhras, ag díriú ar a fógra féin, tá TG4 tar éis súil eile a chaitheamh ar an saol agus ar shaol na hÉireann, ar an nGaeilge agus ar mhuintir na tíre. Molaim TG4 as an méid atá bainte amach aici, go háirithe i dtaobh spóirt agus ó thaobh seirbhís spórt áitiúil a chur ar fáil gach Domhnach. Molaim an stáisiúin as imeachtaí an Choiste um Chuntais Phoiblí a chraoladh agus a thaispeáint to dhaoine. Tá mé ag súil go mbeidh TG4 ag díriú ar aon díospóireacht a bheidh ar síul maidir le leasaithe i dtoghcháin don Oireachtas. If the committee on the Constitution decides to have oral hearings on the review of electoral law and reform of the Oireachtas, I hope TG4 will rise to the challenge of presenting those activities and open up the debate to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Má tá TG4 le bheith neamhspleách agus dualgas uirthi seirbhís phoiblí a thabhairt do dhaoine, an mbeidh dóthain airgid aici? An mbeidh TG4 in ann airgead a fháil ó chomhluchtaí nó an mbeidh sí ag fáil airgid on gceadúnas? Will the licence fee continue to go solely to RTE? RTE will continue to be obliged to give one hour of free television to TG4, but I hope in facing the challenge, with other stations, to become independent it will also be given the support necessary to allow it to continue the service it provides.</P>
    <P>There has been much interest in the section of the Bill dealing with pay-per-view and free to air programmes. Other legislation dealing with the broadcasting of major events guarantees that items of major interest will be free to air. There is always a danger that when more channels are available the best programmes will become less accessible. I want to ensure that the television set does not become the one-armed bandit in the corner. One should not have to pay to see the best and most interesting programmes. It is important to maintain a balance in this regard and this challenge faces us in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The number of channels and services which will be made available by digitalisation is mind-boggling. We must respect human dignity and maintain high standards. We must ensure that we receive the best in broadcasting and not the trash, that programmes are available free to air and not on a pay-per-view basis and that the service offered by new technology reflects the Irish people and gives us the same quality of service which we have got over the past 30 years and which we deserve to get in the next millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an economic and cultural obligation on every Member of this House to pay particular attention to the passage of the Broadcasting Bill as it will have an impact on every citizen in their respective constituencies. This impact will take many forms as Ireland attempts to confirm its presence in the digital age <Col N="825" /> by creating the correct legislative environment for the introduction of digital terrestrial television. Most critically, the Broadcasting Bill seeks to create a way &ndash; if currently somewhat flawed as outlined in this Bill &ndash; to grant the Irish people an opportunity to maintain some control over its broadcasting integrity and cultural destiny.</P>
      <P>While appreciating that legislating for an industry which is currently experiencing such revolutionary change is an almost impossible task, we must ensure that this Bill represents the best option for the Irish people in terms of profiting from the full benefits of the digital age while not compromising our broadcasting culture and traditions. However, the Bill fails in this regard. This Bill must deal with the issue of offering choice to the Irish people with regard to what television platform they prefer to have their television delivered on, the interactive services they will use and how they will embrace and become comfortable with the digital age.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that one of the critical aspects of the success of digital television is an early announcement of when the Government intends to shut off the analogue frequencies. The Minister, in framing and introducing the Bill, has failed in her primary responsibility to create the correct environment for the arrival of the digital age by failing to give an indication of when this date may be and what criteria the Government will use in deciding this important milestone. Once a date has been announced the public will be encouraged to buy into the digital age earlier, thereby consolidating Ireland's position as one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. It must also be considered that once these frequencies have been shut off they will have a strong commercial value, particularly among telecommunications companies, and will undoubtedly yield sizeable revenues for the Exchequer and, I hope, benefit RTE. The Minister is a person who listens and takes notice of what is said in the House and she may be interested to know that the UK, where digital terrestrial television was launched exactly one year ago, has provisionally set the date 2007 for full analogue shut-off. I suggest the Minister should give the House some indication of when an announcement will be made regarding analogue shut-off. Does she agree that an early shut-off date would be a key driver in the take-up of digital terrestrial television?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further confusion surrounds the critical matter of the licence issue. It would appear that the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has different views on the number of licences to be issued as a result of the Broadcasting Bill. In a recent consultative document published by the office of the DTR, Document 99/57, the director clearly states in section 115 that she &ldquo;proposes to provide for two separate licences under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, that is, a programme services multiplex licence which allows a multiplex provider to combine broadcasters' digital signals into a programme service multiplex and <Col N="826" /> secondly a transmission licence, which allows DDT transmission service providers to modulate the programme service complex and to transmit it in the television broadcasting bands&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While accepting that the ODTR is the guardian of the spectrum, could the Minister please confirm that a two license scenario has her seal of approval? If so, should provision be made for this in the Bill? Is it her understanding that to make the introduction of the DTT financially attractive to a commercial partner in Digico, both licences must be awarded to the same entity? These are important questions and I want the Minister to refer to them in her response.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me to forego this opportunity of speaking on the Broadcasting Bill without referring to public service broadcasting. The Minister when introducing the Bill said that that one of the primary objectives of this legislation is: &ldquo;To put in place a regulatory structure that allows private sector broadcasters and public broadcasters to co-exist.&rdquo;  This is a highly contentious issue for some interested parties. Permitting RTE to participate in the proposed entity that is Digico, will allow RTE to become both a private and public broadcaster and, therefore, to sit on both sides of the fence. As well as giving the impression to some of being anti-competitive, it is a cause of major concern to independent television companies who have invested a great deal of money and expertise in giving Ireland an independent option to the State broadcaster. I received a briefing document from one such source who recently invested heavily in the Irish television industry and who believes RTE's participation in the new entity is wholly inappropriate considering its potential conflict with its primary role of public service broadcaster, a role RTE has fulfilled admirably. I want the Minister to allay some of the fears of those people. I am not an expert in this area, but the Minister must clarify certain matters if we are to create the vibrant public private broadcasting sector which we all want.</P>
    <P>It is a valid argument that digital terrestrial television's establishment and operation and it's associated risks are best assumed by private companies geared towards and experienced in risk management and digital television. Such an approach would reduce the potential discriminatory practices which may result in a content-distributor vertically integrated structure and would release revenues available for investment in local programming. Accordingly, I call on the Minister to state her view regarding the position of RTE within the new proposed structure and whether it can exist fairly when it has an interest in both public and private broadcasting in the State. When replying, will she comment on the current situation which allows RTE to receive 100 per cent of the licence fee and whether she intends altering this, considering RTE will have interests in both public and private broadcast sectors as a result of the Broadcasting Bill.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the question of RTE's funding <Col N="827" /> later. Recently I spoke to people in RTE and, as the Minister will be aware, they are concerned about their funding, the capacity of the funding to allow them to deliver on their remit and their responsibility to the public.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the matter of public service broadcasting, it must be remembered that RTE receives 100 per cent of the television licence revenues. The Minister has also alluded to the necessity to provide the public with the option of several different digital television delivery platforms where feasible, namely digital satellite, digital cable and digital wards, and the platform referred to in the Bill, namely digital terrestrial. As digital satellite is currently available and the upgrade to digital cable, as a result of the Government's sale of Cablelink, is well under way, it is generally accepted, both from a technical and commercial standpoint, that the Government's date for the launch of DTT, September 2000, is unattainable now, primarily as a result of the delay in the introduction of the Second Stage debate in this House. The process can be exploited. There are a number of speakers offering. I do not know if Second Stage will finish this week. In addition, there are a large number of amendments being tabled to the Bill. I heard Deputy Rabbitte referring to the number of amendments which have been tabled by his colleague, Deputy O'Shea, and Deputy Kenny indicated to me before he left that he will table a number of amendments. As I expect this debate will not be guillotined, I can see it continuing for some time if we, as legislators, are to fulfil our responsibility to the people. This Bill is important to the ordinary people and they probably do not realise that is the case because it is a technical Bill. Many Deputies would have little knowledge of the Bill and of what is happening in the House today. It is important that we address the issues I raise and those raised by other Deputies before this Bill becomes law because we are unlikely to get another opportunity in the foreseeable future judging by the way legislation is processed. We must get it right. It is up to us to help the Minister in every way possible to get it right.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that the statement re the delay and the September 2000 launch date is correct, and if so, allowing for the inordinate delay we are experiencing on the legislation front, what is a realistic date for the launch of DTT? Will this delay affect the financial viability of DTT, allowing for the ambitious roll-out agenda which is an integral part of the cable companies' licences? It is important that the Minister clarify whether a September launch date is realisable and realistic.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that a number of international consortiums have expressed an initial interest in becoming the commercial partner of RTE in the new digital entity. However, interested parties have become both concerned and frustrated at the lack of accurate information emanating from both the Minister's office and <Col N="828" /> AIB Corporate Finance, which the Minister commissioned to oversee and administer the entire process of network transfer to Digico. Considering the fiasco we experienced in the appointment of the third mobile network licensee, it is in the State's best interest and that of prospective commercial parties to Digico that the Minister outlines what will be the relevant criteria used in the selection of the commercial partner in Digico, what timeframe is now accurate for the selection of this partner considering that it is 10 November and the Bill is only being introduced, what format will this selection process follow, will it be an auction or will a formal request for proposals be issued and administered accordingly? When will the, by now, infamous information memorandum, which I asked the Minister about in the Dáil a few weeks ago, be issued and what is the delay? This is very important to the interested parties. It was promised some weeks ago and there is now a question mark over why it has not been issued. When the Minister replies, I want her to refer to that also.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday the Minister stated on Second Stage that, despite the convergence of relevant technologies associated with the delivery of broadcasting services and telecommunications, she did not feel it would be appropriate that one office be responsible for its regulations. I acknowledge that, while the Minister has accepted that there is an argument for a single regulator, it is not a view she shares. She stated that the EU also believes that one omnipotent regulator scenario is not currently valid. I wonder, in accepting the EU view, has the Minister made allowance for the size of Ireland in comparison, for example, to the population of France and Germany, whose Governments heavily influenced current EU policy in this area and who, in the past, manifested an inability to regulate their own marketplaces?</P>
    <P>The absence of a single regulator deprives Ireland of its ability to control its destiny in terms of creating a fully competitive environment and removing the protectionist barriers that have for so long stifled growth and deterred private investment in this sector. In the absence of a single regulator, distortions of competition must be reduced through the introduction of proper accountability on the part of public service broadcasters to an adequately equipped executive regulatory authority. RTE and TG4 should come under the auspices of the new broadcasting commission, while the network's regulatory infrastructure should fall under the jurisdiction of the ODTR.</P>
    <P>I wish to revisit the at times controversial subject of public service broadcasting. It would benefit all interested parties &ndash; I refer here to RTE, independent television companies and prospective Digico partners &ndash; if the Minister gave a clear, adequate and unambiguous definition of the public service remit, which would involve specific references to the type of public service programmes to be provided and set specific, <Col N="829" /> objectively verifiable targets in relation to those types of programmes, for example, their number and timing. I refer here to programmes of national and cultural interest, Irish co-productions, and non-Irish programmes of specific interest to the Irish viewers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin made a number of interesting comments and, as a result, I will refer briefly to RTE and its remit. RTE will continue to play an important role in Irish broadcasting. The station has provided a tremendous service to the country. I worked with an independent production company at the studios of RTE where I received great co-operation and had access to a wealth of expertise in helping to produce a number of documentaries on Kerry writers. If it were not for RTE, the valuable information contained in those documentaries on people, such as Micheál Ó Hehir, who are no longer living and the footage of interviews given by individuals such as Bryan McMahon would no longer be available.</P>
    <P>It is important that a balance is struck in terms of competition in any future arrangement. At the same time, however, the important public service broadcasting role RTE has honourably provided in the past should be protected as far as possible. To do that, the station requires money. This year, regardless of the need to restructure its operations, it will lose approximately £6 million. Private sector operators are anxious about how the money from licence fees is spent, while the authorities at RTE are concerned about the percentage of funding they can obtain from licence fees. I am sure they do not mind sharing what is a big pot but the current licence fee is inadequate. The previous Administration addressed this issue by making a commitment to introduce an index-linked increase in respect of licence fees. The Minister must now take further action in that regard.</P>
    <P>The passage of the Bill will change forever the concept that television will continue to be a passive medium in Ireland, reserved strictly for entertainment. Instead it will become an interactive terminal that people will be able to use to assist them with daily activities such as shopping, sending e-mails and banking, in addition to availing of more traditional services such as entertainment and news gathering. However, we must not, as elected representatives, shirk our responsibility to ensure this choice of service is available to the entire population, therefore, guaranteeing that we prevent the creation of an information rich and an information poor society. That is a very important principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Deenihan on his excellent contribution. The broadcasting industry in this country is 71 years old. The Radio and Television Act, 1988, established the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the main task of which was the development of broadcasting at national and, particularly, local level. It is now intended to transfer the activities of the Independent Radio and Television Com<Col N="830" /> mission to the proposed new commission. Revenue from advertising in 1995 was estimated at £100 million. At present, the Independent Radio and Television Commission contributes a levy of 3 per cent to the commercial income of local radio stations but the Bill proposes that the Minister can, by order, allow the commission to vary this.</P>
      <P>The 1988 Act was the most important development in the area of broadcasting during the past 30 years. No other major changes, with the exception of the establishment of local radio stations, took place during that period. In my opinion, the bulk of the £100 million raised through advertising in 1995 went to RTE. Since then, however, a sizeable amount of revenue has been generated by local radio stations. With the revenue from television licence fees estimated at £70 million, RTE has a considerable income and has been the biggest player in the field until now. Major changes are taking place in broadcasting and we are entering a new era of massive competition.</P>
      <P>Local radio stations have been very successful since 1988. The Minister should take into consideration the investment these stations make in respect of training their staff. In certain instances, these operations are profit-driven and they are run on a shoestring. Deputy Deenihan referred to the archival material retained by RTE during a difficult period and the new commission should consider what has been achieved by local radio stations in the past ten years. It would be very easy to maintain the <i>status quo </i>but a number of major changes are required in this area. Courses should be offered to teach people the skills required to record archival material that relates to their communities. The Minister should make funding available at county level to allow people to make radio programmes and empower them to create their own images and project the positive aspects of life within the communities in which they live.</P>
      <P>Local radio stations have little or no resources to enable them to produce cultural programmes. I have the highest regard for these stations &ndash; they were a fantastic development &ndash; but they are run on a shoestring and their total revenue comes from advertising. In today's competitive world, the presenter of a major chat show might also read the news and death notices.</P>
      <P>We have entered a period of major change where improvements in training are required. We need to offer training courses in presentation skills, interview techniques, digital editing for radio, research, sound desk operation, writing for radio, personal development and language and computer skills. Using the 1.5 per cent of revenue which it receives, the commission should establish a fund for the development of those skills. There would be many benefits &ndash; the participants would have a medium to project their own image and would learn practical skills which could be put to commercial use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish broadcasting is at the threshold of a revol<Col N="831" /> ution which will create a demand in all areas for people with radio skills. Many people who started out in local radio now appear on national television. Any training programme should invest in the necessary recording facilities. The future development of community radio requires funding at local level. The bulk of the revenue goes to the main players, such as RTE, while local radio picks up the local advertiser. It is an area the Minister should examine.</P>
    <P>The recent sale of Cablelink for £535 million provides some idea of the value of television and information services. The decision by the Government to invest heavily in digital technology and to restructure the operations of RTE and TG4 in the process is particularly significant.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by cases, such as Bere Island local radio, where the local station ceases broadcasting on a Friday evening and does not return to the airwaves until Monday morning solely because of costs. The quality of programming on local stations is excellent and all polls have indicated that they have a huge listenership. The Minister talked about the independence of our national airwaves &ndash; where local radio stations are listened to by 55 per cent of the population there should be a massive improvement. The Minister should not overlook this in these reforms. Regardless of the number of television channels available, most people in rural areas still listen to local radio stations.</P>
    <P>It is essential to retain the services of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission rather than have its functions subsumed into the new Broadcasting Commission. It would be inappropriate for a single body to act as a standard setter, complaints agency and arbitrator.</P>
    <P>This is the most far-reaching legislation in this area since 1988. It will introduce digital television providing 35 channels to Ireland. RTE will remain a major player, owning up to 40 per cent in a deal, but the remainder will be owned by commercial interests. This is multi-million pound business and there are very few players in the field who will be able to afford to be part of it. Will a monopoly similar to that in the print media be allowed? In certain cases a number of consortia might become involved. The 40 per cent shareholding represents a good deal for RTE, although it depends what sum is represented by that 40 per cent. RTE has done a great job since its foundation and we are indebted to it. It is wonderful that so many great people in history have been recorded, but the future role of broadcasting is to safeguard the history of tomorrow for future generations.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the Bill is a definition of public service broadcasting. The number of television channels available via cable, satellite or MMDS will put public television under huge pressure. Unless a strong commitment to public service broadcasting is written into legislation, the licence fee could be called into question as viewers turn to the alternatives to RTE. That will happen. <Col N="832" /> There will be 30 new channels representing a huge threat to RTE. Already there is competition with Sky and other providers and with niche channels aiming for a particular market.</P>
    <P>The concept of pay per view television must be examined in the context of the information rich and the information poor. Often it is people on lower incomes and social welfare who have more time to hire videos. Even in a supermarket, at the confectionery end of the business the biggest customers are the people on lower incomes. They are not the most prudent shoppers and the same situation will exist in this market. There will be pressure on people to have pay per view television in their homes.</P>
    <P>It is a new phenomenon to have so many channels. The quality of programming is important. There should be programmes dealing with current affairs and politics. Under the Bill RTE becomes a public service programme provider. Its transmission system will be privatised and RTE will pay to be involved in partnership with a new commercial transmission company. Establishing that company will be a major responsibility because once the 60 per cent not owned by RTE is sold, it will be outside Government control. Will the Minister allow a monopoly in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>The entertainment and media sectors face significant issues arising from globalisation, digitalisation and the Internet. Against this background the Broadcasting Bill is a significant development in the history of Irish broadcasting. It seeks to put into place a foundation for the development of Irish broadcasting services into the next century, ensuring that the State stays abreast of change.</P>
    <P>How will these new channels be filled? Will providers from other countries be allowed into the market? Where will the content come from? What will the level of original content be? Is the Irish audience of sufficient scale? Will there be an adequate level of demand for services? Will there be sufficient demand for advertising? With increased competition in the industry, RTE's revenue will be affected because of the number of channels that will be available. There will be a huge choice for advertisers and it will be difficult for RTE to retain its customers, but competition is good. RTE had projected advertising revenue of £100 million in 1995, but will that be maintained with increased competition? The major players in advertising are well known in the market and many of them will be selective. A number have diversified into local radio which will affect RTE's revenue. Will the licence fee be index-linked or will the Minister set the fee?</P>
    <P>The Bill expands the role of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and renames it as the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. It provides for it to be funded by the Exchequer rather than through an income levy on broadcasters. It is strange that the BCI will play an important role in the regulation of digital broadcasting in all platforms and the development of <Col N="833" /> codes, rules, guidelines and standards with respect to programme materials, broadcasting advertising or other forms of commercial promotion. This will involve BCI entering into contracts with providers of broadcasting content. BCI will be given powerful legislative responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I am delighted RTE will be required to provide an annual report on how television licensing revenue has expanded. Undoubtedly, many accounting issues will be addressed in providing expenditure for services under the public service remit, leaving aside the debate on the definition of &ldquo;public service&rdquo;. The Bill provides for the establishment of TG4 as a separate statutory co-operative body and many issues noted in regard to RTE will apply equally to TG4. RTE has a great deal more resources than TG4 or any new station which intends to set up.</P>
    <P>I am also delighted the Minister has promised to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to relax the prohibition on religious advertising. This was introduced during Private Members' Business previously and it is important that the amendment is made. Given the multitude of non-Irish services available, there is an unanswerable case for strong public service broadcasting that caters for the specific needs and culture of Irish viewers, especially on issues of public concern. As the broadcasting industry expands with the advent of increased competition through the issue of more licences, does the Minister intend to appoint an independent assessor to monitor RTE's remit as a public broadcaster? How will he or she be assured RTE fulfils its role? Will he or she have to depend on the annual report of the RTE Authority?</P>
    <P>It is important to monitor the quality of programming and the content of home based production. There are opportunities for film producers to make programmes in Ireland and to take advantage of tax benefits. A separate company could be set up to deal with this area. It is equally important that such programming should be available on other channels in America and the UK. A number of people in the UK cannot receive RTE and that is a major loss.</P>

      <P>Some Members opposite might be jealous of my youth. All of us can picture a group of people sitting around a table listening to a wireless and recall the advent of black and white televisions with rabbits ears. One often had to bang the top of the television or move the rabbits ears to improve reception. Many people can relate to that.</P>
      <P>Over the years radio and television broadcasting have been a powerful means of mass communication. There has been tremendous change in broadcasting systems, communications networks and televisions, video recorders, radios, and so on. Broadcasting has considerable influence on our understanding of different issues. The way it is presented often influences the way we think. Since the era of black and white television, we have witnessed the introduction of colour television, different sound systems and televisions of various shapes, sizes and quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common for many of us to sit on our sofas and change television channels without getting up, and one might even need three or four remote controls to use the various networks and facilities. It is possible to buy a remote control which will operate all the available technology and receive all the networks one wishes to have. There has been tremendous change in broadcasting. I acknowledge, as the Minister has done, that broadcasters in the public service have always provided universal access to a certain level of information, education and entertainment and have contributed greatly to a shared sense of community and interests regardless of where we live and who we are. I congratulate all involved. In particular I pay tribute to Radio Teilifís Éireann for which I have a high regard. I congratulate some of the lead presenters on the manner in which they present their programmes: Marian Finucane, Joe Duffy, Gerry Ryan, Marty Whelan, Pat Kenny, Vincent Browne, Eamon Dunphy. Going through the list we can appreciate the diversity of their presentations and how they relay the required information to the public. I acknowledge the team spirit of the researchers in the backroom and all that goes with it. Given the range of current affairs programmes and other programmes on radio and TV, Lyric FM, Radio 1, 98FM and FM104, a tremendous array of programmes are presented in a professional manner. <Col N="835" /> This has developed in recent years and stretches back to the beginning of RTE in 1961.</P>
    <P>I do not give plaudits all the time, I am prepared to criticise on occasion. I was amused when watching the first half of a programme by RTE recently where a particular national issue was presented. In the opening remarks there was a criticism that the Minister with responsibility did not participate in the programme. Initially I was concerned because I felt that, perhaps, the Minister should have been present. Having seen the audience that had been invited to participate in the programme I support whoever took the decision that the Minister should not participate. On that occasion there was a biased audience that would not have been in the best interests of fairness and professionalism which we normally see from RTE.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Broadcasting Bill. This is the first broadcasting legislation in the past decade. In that period there have been significant changes and major developments in the arena of broadcasting. The onset of digital technology provides further tremendous opportunity for the provision of a vast additional range of information society services. We must ensure that those services can compete with regulation in the marketplace. Digital terrestrial television, DTT, is the way forward in broadcasting communication as we turn the century into the new millennium. I welcome the focus to put in place an appropriate infrastructure to promote and develop digital services and the clear policy objective of a universal service.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to one of the previous speakers who questioned the Minister on the reason for going down the route of DTT. The Minister has adequately explained in her opening contribution and on other occasions the reason DTT has been chosen. I concur with and support the Minister in her decision. In going down this road we must ensure specific standards are complied with in respect of what has been referred to as the taste and decency of programme material. The Minister is proactive in ensuring the legislative proposals will confer additional powers and functions on the new Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. Will the Minister clarify what level of consumer consultation will take place to enable the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland draw up its codes and rules in relation to programme standards? This is one of the major concerns of the public in relation to DTT. While I welcome the fact the Minister has been proactive in this regard, will she specify what role the consumer will have and what type of reporting structure will be in place and so on?</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the promotion of the beneficial aspects of the digital era for people with a sensory disability and especially those with a hearing impediment. I know a number of people with deafness problems and the new digital developments in television broadcasting opens a new accommodation which is welcome. The Minister is convinced that DTT offers the best opportunity <Col N="836" /> of providing an acceptable level of free air digital broadcasting services which will be available to all our citizens. Her clear statement that the role of broadcasting services in ensuring access by all our citizens to a level of participation in the information society guarantees the maintenance of our democracy is an important underlying principle.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for programme contracts, relating to the relay of local and community programmes in the digital era, referred to in three forms &ndash; the local interest service which can be provided on cable and MMDS systems, the second commercial cable and MMDS system and local community and service providers. I have a high regard for the benefits that accrue from local and community programmes and I ask the Minister to review the support and encouragement of such programmes for the Dublin area. Will the Minister indicate the level of support for local and community programmes, the take-up of such support and, more importantly, the issues that have been brought to her Department's attention by service providers or intended providers on difficulties in the marketplace? I would appreciate if the Minister would refer to urban areas as well as the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the service providers in my own area on the service currently provided but I understand they have a number of difficulties and that there are obstacles in the way. If issues have been brought to the Minister's attention, given that we are reviewing the legislative proposals for broadcasting, I would like to see the response to those issues with a view to encouraging further development of community programmes in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Minister confirmed that there is a need for a national service which will cater for the needs for all citizens in the new era of broadcasting. She made the unambiguous statement that there is an unanswerable case for a strong public broadcasting service to cater for the specific needs and culture of Irish viewers by contextualising issues of concern to them to ensure the maintenance of democracy.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the cost of houses is excluded from the consumer price index; the examples, if any, within the EU where this situation arises; the plans, if any, he has to include house prices as part of the CPI; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer price index covers the mortgage interest cost of purchasing a dwelling. This reflects the increasing cost of houses and also takes into account the impact of changes in interest rates. Most dwellings are purchased with a mortgage paid over time and the interest cost involved forms the bulk of most purchasers' outlay, especially in the early years.</P>
      <P>The outright purchase of a dwelling, which is a relatively rare occurrence, is not covered in the index as it is taken to be a form of capital investment rather than a consumption expenditure. Down payment in the case of mortgage arrangements and the capital element of mortgage repayments are excluded for the same reason.</P>
      <P>The treatment of owner occupied housing varies in the consumer price indices of other EU member states. Eight countries &ndash; Austria, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Belgium and Spain &ndash; omit owner occupied housing costs; three countries &ndash; Denmark, Germany and The Netherlands &ndash; follow the national account's imputed rent approach based on the estimated notional rent that an owner occupier as a landlord would charge himself or herself as a tenant; and the three remaining countries &ndash; the United Kingdom, Sweden and Finland &ndash; like Ireland take account of mortgage interest payments.</P>
      <P>Owner occupied housing costs are currently excluded from the harmonised index of consumer prices, the HICP, compiled for EU purposes. The possibility of agreeing an acceptable harmonised methodology continues to be examined at EU level. The CSO will reconsider its existing approach if an agreed methodology emerges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that most members of the public find it difficult to understand that, while house price inflation, particularly in the Dublin area, has exceeded 80 per cent and 90 per cent in the past three years, it has had no effect in terms of the consumer price index? Given that many couples are spending almost a third of their monthly income on their mortgages, will the Minister of State accept that it does not reflect the additional expenditure in the economy as a result of the massive increase in house prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was on the opposite side of the House I asked the same questions because I believed, and still do, that the CPI does not take into account the outgoings of real people. That is because, traditionally, the purchase of one's home or property was seen by the CSO and successive Governments as a capital rather than a consumption item. To some extent <Col N="839" /> one could argue, as does the CSO, that it is taken into account somewhat because the interest repayments are factored into the calculation. Obviously, as house prices increase, people's borrowing goes up and therefore the interest paid increases. Even though the rate may decrease, the total amount of interest paid increases and that figure is used in calculating the CPI. It is inaccurate to say that the increased price of houses is not taken into the CPI. It is taken into account to the extent that additional interest is paid on higher prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>First, will the Minister of State confirm that appreciation is not given of the cost of renting in the private rented sector? I understand the CSO use the average figure as given through local authority rents but consideration is not given to the average cost in terms of renting in the private rented sector. Given the massive increase in rents in the private rented sector in recent years, does the Minister agree that a more appropriate mechanism needs to be put in place to reflect that in the consumption figure because it is a consumption figure if people are paying rents on a monthly basis? Second, will the Minister accept that while the affordability level in terms of paying a mortgage has not changed substantially in recent times, there is a difficulty in getting 10 per cent of the total cost of a loan before one can get a mortgage? Many couples now have to borrow from their families, friends and other sources but that is not adequately reflected in the CSO figures. Will the Minister of State address that issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing accounts for approximately 8 per cent of the overall CPI basket. Within that housing account, mortgage interest accounts for 3.6 per cent, rents make up 1.75 per cent, local authority charges make up 0.3 per cent, house insurance is 0.7 per cent and repairs and decorations make up 1.63 per cent. The items the Deputy mentioned are factored into the CPI through the housing accounts element. I acknowledge the Deputy's second point about the cost of housing. Discussions are taking place at EU level on how we can better harmonise the way we account for housing costs in the CPI. Only four countries &ndash; the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden and Ireland &ndash; take mortgage interest into account but eight countries omit housing costs, so perhaps we are more advanced than most countries on this one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 June last I announced a list of public-private partnership projects which had been agreed by the Government to pilot the public-private partnership approach in Ireland. The pilot projects are concentrated in the economic infrastructure sector, including transport and environmental services. The projects selected, subject to statutory procedures and negotiations where appropriate, include a new western river crossing in Limerick on the N7; the Waterford by-pass, including a new bridge over the River Suir, on the N25; the second west link bridge on the M50; and key elements of the Dublin light rail, Luas, project.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is intended to actively explore the potential for a PPP to develop the Kilkock-Kinnegad section of the N4. The Government also agreed to include projects in education, the solid waste management area and water supply in the pilot programme. The specific projects were to be named following further consultations.</P>
      <P>Since then, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, has announced a pilot education project, namely, the Cork School of Music. Details of the other pilot projects will be made public as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that my Department is taking a constructive and positive approach to identifying the role that PPPs can play in facilitating the development of infrastructure and finding effective means of putting them in place as quickly as possible. It is my intention to ensure that, where appropriate, the use of the PPP process should be maximised with a view to achieving long-term value for money for the public sector.</P>
      <P>Public-private partnerships will also be an important element in the National Development Plan, 2000-06, in helping to address infrastructural investment needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Departments directly responsible for the programme areas, in co-operation with the Department of Finance, have already started to develop the selected projects in detail and will continue to do so over the coming months, with particular reference to the potential for private sector finance. The aim is to seek tenders or other proposals from the private sector as quickly as <Col N="842" /> possible. All the projects will, in any case, have to go through the appropriate public procurement procedures, in accordance with domestic and EU law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread concern among private contractors who have expressed an interest in public-private partnerships and who have submitted proposals to the Department of Finance, that the Minister and his Department are not really sincere about the concept of public-private partnerships, that no progress has been made on the bulk of the applications and that there is a widespread belief, based on comments by senior public servants, that the Government and Departments believe they could carry out the work more cheaply themselves, as they could borrow money at a cheaper rate on the open market? Will he categorically state that the Government is sincere about this and will proceed with it? Will he examine the progress of submissions made to date because nothing is happening, regardless of what his briefing note says?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that nothing could be further from the truth, in terms of what is happening in the Department of Finance. It is not true that the private sector has given indications of the type he said. On the contrary, IBEC, including the CIF, recently stated publicly, and privately in meetings with officials, that it is very satisfied with the progress being made on the development of public-private partnerships.</P>
      <P>Since I was appointed Minister for Finance I have spent a great deal of time trying to ensure that the Department of Finance is not blamed for holding up any of these projects. A clear indication has gone out from my Department to the line Departments that every possible project that can be dealt with on a PPP basis should be assessed on those lines. The line Departments assess these projects in the first instance. The Department of Finance's job is to liaise and drive PPP projects in the line Departments. I have ensured that my officials have driven the process of PPP and encouraged line Departments in this regard. The private sector organisations have publicly expressed their satisfaction with what we are doing.</P>
      <P>I accept there is possibly a reluctance in some line Departments to go further down the road of PPP. However, I refute categorically the imputations that appeared in some media organs over the past year that the Department of Finance is holding up projects. Whatever happened in the Department of Finance previous to my tenure is no longer the case. We have gone out of our way to ensure the line Departments do everything in their power to encourage the PPP process. I take this opportunity to emphasise that it is a key part of my policy to ensure that the PPP process goes ahead in every possible area as quickly as possible.</P>

I put it to him also that although the hold-ups are not in his Department, he has primary responsibility for ensuring that Government policy in this area is implemented. What formal procedures does he have in place to ensure that proposals are actively dealt with in line Departments, so that the private sector investment which the economy so needs is not frustrated by persons who take it upon themselves to operate a policy other than the one stated by the Government?</P>

I accept there may be officials in some line Departments who have not yet fully bought into the idea of public-private partnerships. My Department is driving this process. We have an overall co-ordinating role and have set up PPP units in the relevant line Departments. Meetings are held quite regularly with the line Departments. There is an advisory group involving the public and private sectors. Everything humanly possible has been done by the officials of the Department of Finance to drive this process.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that on 20 October 1998 the Government agreed in principle to the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector at the earliest date possible and agreed to the immediate establishment of an implementation advisory group to progress the necessary work. The group's report was finalised on 19 May 1999 and submitted to the Tánaiste and me the following day. The report, which contains a consider<Col N="844" /> able number of recommendations, was published on 23 June 1999 at which time I asked interested parties to make their views known so that as much public debate as possible can take place. Decisions have not yet been taken on any aspect of the group's proposals. The Tánaiste and I hope to be in a position to bring joint proposals to Government in the near future in relation to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised by the Minister's response. However, it is a little strange that he is looking for further proposals as he set up the group in the first place to advise on the implementation of a decision which he rightly points out was taken a year ago. Does the Minister agree with the Tánaiste's comments when answering questions in the House last week when she said that she was concerned about whether the culture of the Central Bank could change in order to &ldquo;do the job required&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Tánaiste's comments last week in the Dáil and on previous occasions. However, the position is as I have just outlined. At some point in the near future we will bring a joint memorandum to Government on foot of the McDowell implementation advisory group proposals. The nine eminent people on the group came up with three separate proposals. Since the group reported, I have received at least another 100 proposals from a wide variety of sources as to the possible location of a single regulatory authority. I welcome the Fine Gael proposals I received from Deputy Noonan and I would like to receive the Labour Party's proposals. I will take these views into account when considering this issue.</P>

      <P>As is known, the officials of the Department on the implementation group together with the Central Bank official came up with one recommendation. The majority of the group came up with the recommendation supported by the Deputy. A minority report by the representative of the Department of the Taoiseach put forward a kind of twin pillar idea. There were different opinions in the nine person group. I have Deputy Noonan's suggestion which is different to that of Deputy McDowell. I am the most open person who could hold office in the Department of Finance and I will take all of these opinions into account in coming forward with the joint memorandum for Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Following a joint submission from the boards of ACC and TSB, the Government agreed in principle on 16 February 1999 to the merger and flotation of ACC and TSB. On 1 April 1999, I announced the establishment of a non-statutory board for the new bank under the chairmanship of Mr. Matthew Barrett to assist me in planning the merger-flotation process. On 27 July 1999, Mr. Padraic O'Connor was appointed chairman of the non-statutory board following Mr. Matthew Barrett's appointment as chief executive officer of Barclays Bank.</P>
      <P>On 27 May 1999, following a competitive tender process, I appointed IBI Corporate Finance Ltd. and Davy Stockbrokers in association with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette International as my financial advisers and lead brokers, and Arthur Cox, solicitors, as my legal advisers for the process. My officials have been working with ACC, TSB, NewBank and my advisers on the development of plans for the merger and flotation. Among the matters to be considered in the run up to a flotation would be the proportion of shares to be allocated to institutional investors and to the general public as well as to long-standing customers. I have already indicated that I am prepared to reserve a specific number of shares for long-standing customers of ACC and TSB at the offer price, subject to confirmation that there are no problems in relation to domestic or EU legal requirements. Work is also on-going in the preparation of legislation to effect the merger and I intend to submit the heads of a Bill for Government approval early next year. I intend to present the Bill to the Oireachtas for enactment early next year.</P>
      <P>Following a number of meetings between the parties during September and October, partnership arrangements between management and unions under the auspices of an independent facilitator are currently being put in place. I understand that management also intends to open discussions with the unions in the near future in relation to their plans for the merger of the two banks, which could be implemented early next year. In that context, discussions will be held with staff in relation to an ESOP. As I have previously advised the House, I envisage that up to 5 per cent of the shares of the merged bank will be available for allocation to employees in return for significant, quantifiable and verifiable productivity enhancement and flexibility. A further 9.9 per cent of the shares will be made available for purchase by employees.</P>
      <P>The merger and transfer to the private sector of ACC Bank and TSB Bank is in the best interests of the staff and customers of both banks. Recent developments in the banking sector only serve to re-emphasise the need to push ahead with this and I will be keeping the position under close review in conjunction with the board of NewBank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his informative reply from which a number of questions arise. Can the Minister assure the House that the industrial relations difficulties which looked like putting the merger-flotation off the rails have been overcome, or do I understand from his answer that he is simply putting a process in place to overcome these difficulties? Is it the intention that 100 per cent of the merged company will be floated by way of public offer or will it be a partial flotation? Is the Minister open to the purchase of the merged entity by one financial institution or is it his view that there should be a full, open offer where a multiplicity of private and institutional shareholders would participate in the purchase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the industrial relations difficulties, despite the fact that I do not think it appropriate for the Minister to intervene in these problems, I have spent much time in recent months trying to resolve some of the peripheral industrial relations problems. In that context, I mean industrial relations in the broadest sense and not specific problems. These efforts were designed to get over the problems of getting the staff on both sides into a process. In recent times both sides agreed to the appointment of a facilitator, Mr. Phil Flynn, who has been working over recent weeks as a result of meetings I had with both sides to develop the process.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second question, the decision of the Government relates to merging and floating 100 per cent of the new entity. Therefore, the Deputy's third question does not necessarily arise.</P>
      <P>Since making the decision to merge and float we have not made as much progress as I would have liked due to industrial relations difficulties. It is, however, still my intention to merge and float 100 per cent of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that behind some of the difficulties which have arisen in the past three months is a fundamental flaw, namely, the decision to merge and float at the same time? Is it not also true that TSB management is taking over ACC in advance of the formal merger, and that that is causing inevitable tensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to recap on some of the history in this regard. The idea of a merger-flotation of ACC and TSB did not come from the Government. When the idea first came from the ACC group of unions, nobody was more surprised than myself while my officials had to be carried out of the office when this suggestion was made as we did not think it would be put forward. After some considerable time a response came from the trustees of the TSB who said the way forward was to merge and float. This idea came from the staff. I remember that after a wide consultation process there was a 97 per cent acceptance in the ACC of going this route. I wish to <Col N="848" /> place on record that it was the staff who decided on the merger and flotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should clarify the question as I do not dispute anything the Minister has said. I was suggesting that the flaw was the decision to merge and float simultaneously rather than first merging the two entities and floating at a later stage. That is the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some further discussions with my colleagues in Government and having assessed everything we decided to go with this merger and flotation proposal. This is still the position.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second question relates to a perception which may have caused some of the difficulties referred to earlier. Although this idea originated among the ACC staff, in recent months the perception may have been that this was a take-over by the TSB of the ACC. That is why I have had to spend some time in recent months liaising with staff representatives. A facilitator has been appointed in order that any extant difficulties and perceptions can be dealt with as speedily and effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I repeat what I have said many times to the unions and their representatives, namely, that this is a merger of equals. The <i>raison d'être</i> of the proposal was a merger of equals, that the newly combined bank of ACC and TSB, referred to as &ldquo;New Bank&rdquo;, would be a stronger and better financial entity, and that is what we have bought into. I repudiate the notion of a take-over by one side or the other. The process will not work unless everybody agrees it is a merger of equals. Mr. Flynn has taken the job of facilitator and I hope he will be able to resolve any problems that arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <P>I put it to the Minister that the atmosphere for a public flotation of ACC-TSB is not as good as it would have been a couple of months ago. I also put it to him that he took too robust a view in his discussions with the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, on the appropriate offer price for Eircom, and the fact that Eircom is today trading 13 points below the offer price and 500,000 citizens are showing a loss on their investment is reducing the enthusiasm for any flotation proposed by the Minister since quite clearly he got the offer price of the last flotation wrong and many people got their fingers burned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly accept that the climate of flotation in terms of financial institutions has changed considerably in recent months. The perception of Irish financial institutions and their valuation has changed remarkably in recent months due to the convergence of a wide variety of things. One has only to look at the price at which one can now buy major banking stocks in comparison to the price last February or March. I agree with the Deputy that the <Col N="849" /> climate has changed in terms of appetite for the flotation of a financial institution. However, one must remember that the idea behind the merger and flotation of ACC and TSB, which the staff representatives suggested, was to ensure the new entity was far better than the two individual entities. On a number of occasions I have repeated that I do not see a role for two small financial institutions, something with which most people agree. The events of the past couple of months in terms of the financial stocks of other financial institutions bears this out. Therefore, the reasoning behind having a better and stronger joint operation still stands.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second question related to Eircom. The price of Eircom shares was set by the Cabinet sub-committee and I am very pleased with the price at which the stock has been trading in recent times. About 500,000 people applied for Eircom shares and there are about 10,000 employees. Therefore, according to my calculation that left about 3.1 million people who did not have the financial muscle to buy Telecom Éireann stocks from savings or to raise money from their local financial institution. The job of the Minister for Finance is to speak up for those people. I would look a right idiot today if the stock was trading very high and the Deputy was rightly saying I set a price which was too low. I did a great deal on behalf of the plain people of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

At this stage I have made no principled decision on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the independent working group, which I established to examine the issue of the taxation of credit union savings, was presented to me in October of last year. Earlier this year I made the report publicly available. The group, which comprised officials from the <Col N="850" /> Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and an independent chairman, failed to agree on a set of findings. However, the chairman recommended that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed. I have received written representations from the Irish League of Credit Unions and its members, in support of the recommendations made by the chairman of the working group.</P>
      <P>When considering how best to proceed with the demands for tax free savings, including DIRT, for credit union members, one must be sensitive to the EU dimension. The EU Commission decided not to regard the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions as a State aid. A key consideration which influenced their decision is that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the Commission to the corporation tax exemption could change if dividends were exempted from income tax up to a certain limit as recommended by the chairman of the working group. This is a point which complicates the issue and should not be overlooked by those now seeking an exemption of credit union dividends from income tax.</P>
      <P>I am fully conversant with the views of the league as they were contained in the report of the working group. Consequently, at this stage I have no plans to meet with the Irish League of Credit Unions. The differing views within the working group reflect the complexity of this issue. I am giving the matter ongoing consideration and as yet have no proposals to amend the law in this regard.</P>

There is no other group in the country with whose views I am more conversant and I have the stabs in the back to prove it. There is no need, therefore, to meet the league again. I know its views and I have met its representatives previously. Its views were given to the working group and were reported on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister has a vendetta against the Irish League of Credit Unions. The Minister mentioned the working <Col N="851" /> group. Will he accept that six of the nine members of that group agreed with the recommendations of the report? That should be sufficient to warrant the implementation of the recommendations. Does the Minister intend to implement any of them at this stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the report and I am aware of the complexities of this issue. They are not all one sided. There is now another dimension which must be taken into account but which did not exist when the working group reported. The EU dimension was not a matter of consideration for the working group because the decision of the Commission was made after the group's deliberations.</P>
      <P>There was a complaint to the EU Commission about the benign tax regime relating to credit unions in Ireland. The Commission examined that and gave its decision. That was after the working group reported to me. The decision of the Commission to take a benign attitude to the corporation tax exemption credit unions have under Irish tax law was influenced by the fact that the dividends and interest to members arising from their holding of credit union shares or deposits are liable to income tax. If one were to change that and go along with the recommendations made by the credit union, one would assuredly put at risk the corporation tax exemption which credit unions enjoy. That was taken into account by the Commission. It is not simply a matter of going along with the majority credit union report.</P>
      <P>In light of recent events, Members should be slow to propose that any group of citizens should enjoy a tax exemption at the expense of other persons of the same status. A survey of the membership of credit unions shows members to have more or less the same profile as people who have accounts in other financial institutions. That survey is readily available. One should be particularly careful in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the overview of the NESC report, Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice &ndash; the council's new report on Ireland's economic and social strategy for the three year period 2000 to 2002 &ndash; published last week.</P>
      <P>It is important to be clear on what precisely the NESC report states on public expenditure. A key statement in it reads:</P>
      <P>The Council believes that, over the three years to 2002, the real increase in public expenditure should, at a maximum, correspond to the real growth rate of GNP. Allowing current public spending to grow by a rate no greater than the increase in GNP implies a significant slowdown on the trend increase in spending during the 1990s if, as expected, the economy grows more slowly in the period ahead. If the previous increases were to continue against a background of slower growth, the health of the public finances would be seriously weakened.</P>
      <P>The report did not recommend that the increase in expenditure should be 5 per cent per annum over the next five years. Real growth in spending means the rate of increase above inflation which, for the purposes of its report, the NESC has assumed to be 2 per cent per annum. The NESC outlined two scenarios, which showed the impact on the budget surplus of given real increases in current expenditure based on an assumed real GNP growth of 5 per cent and an assumed real GNP growth of 2.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under the first scenario, the report shows that if real current spending growth is 4 per cent per annum, that is, less than the assumed 5 per cent real rate of economic growth, the budget surplus would gradually increase over the period to 2005. If the real increase in current spending is 6 per cent per annum, the budget surplus would stabilise at about 1 per cent, which is less than the present surplus.</P>
      <P>Under the second scenario, with an assumed real rate of economic growth of 2.5 per cent, the NESC report shows that real current expenditure growth of 4 per cent would result in the elimination of the present surplus and progression to a balanced budget position by 2005, while real current expenditure growth of 6 per cent would produce a large deficit by 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" />
      <i>Additional Information</i>The NESC report emphasises that the assumption, which it uses about a 5 per cent rate of economic growth, is not in any sense a forecast but a &ldquo;reasonable conjecture about future economic performance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The NESC's view of the possible maximum rate of growth in public current expenditure in the context of an assumed 5 per cent economic growth rate is clearly well above the Government's commitment to limit the growth in net current expenditure to 4 per cent per annum on average. The 4 per cent is a nominal figure, that is, it includes inflation and is equivalent to a real increase of about 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The NESC report concluded that the evolution of the fiscal balance hinges on the relationship between the real rate of increase in current public expenditure and the real growth rate of GNP. This is true after taking into account other budgetary variables, notably the levels of capital expenditure and taxation. The Government's ceiling of 4 per cent on the growth of current expenditure was not, however, linked to the growth rate of GNP.</P>
    <P>A change in the Government's 4 per cent annual average limit on net current expenditure growth is not envisaged. The recently published review of the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, restates its commitment to the 4 per cent ceiling on the average annual growth in net current expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconcile the manner in which the NESC calculates increases in expenditure with his commitment on behalf of the Government to contain public expenditure increases to 4 per cent in nominal terms? Is he speaking in two languages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty regarding definitions. As far back as the publication of the Fianna Fáil manifesto, I said what the 4 per cent referred to. The manifesto states net current spending, that is, net voted current spending plus the central fund. That was carried over in the Fianna Fáil-PD programme for Government and it was not until Deputy Garret FitzGerald, in a series of articles in <i>The Irish Times,</i> pointed out this matter that people realised it did not mean a 4 per cent increase in spending. In recent years the net voted current expenditure has been much more than 4 per cent, but the commitment is to an average of 4 per cent of net voted spending plus the central fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems with definitions in this regard. NESC is referring to current spending, voted spending and what the overall growth rate should be <i>vis-à-vis </i>the real rate of economic <Col N="857" /> growth. The real rate is the rate of GNP growth less inflation. There are differences in the definitions. Even the NESC report switches between current and real spending and that is confusing. We are speaking in two languages, so to speak, but I have read, with increasing interest, that even eminent commentators refer to a 4 per cent increase in spending whereas the net voted spending in each year I have been in office has been much higher than 4 per cent. The intention, however, is to keep the average increase in net current spending at the level as defined, at an average of 4 per cent of net current spending plus the central fund, over the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that in the Book of Estimates for the two budgets introduced by the Minister the increases in real expenditure &ndash; as a normal person would understand it &ndash; have been between 6 per cent and 7 per cent and that the Book of Estimates he will publish tomorrow will continue that trend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the increase in current spending, net voted current spending, in each of the published Books of Estimates since I took up office has been greater than even 6 per cent. The Deputy referred to &ldquo;real expenditure&rdquo; in his question. If one allows for inflation, the increases probably have been 6 per cent. We will have to wait until tomorrow to see what is in the Book of Estimates for this year. I am very clear about this because I spent a good deal of time in Opposition thinking up how I could control expenditure in Government and rather than referring to real, net and gross figures, or no figures at all, I came up with this definition. I am clear about what I promised in Opposition and in Government, although others may not be.</P>

      <P>In March of this year the Berlin Council &ldquo;in recognition of the special efforts for the peace process in Northern Ireland&rdquo; decided that &ldquo;the Peace Programme will be continued for five years with an amount of 500 million euro of which 100 million euro will be allocated to the border counties&rdquo; over the period 2000 to 2004. These funds represent the EU element of the programme and will account for 75 per cent of the total funding to be made available. The Exchequer, local authorities and other bodies will provide the remaining matching funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new programme will build on the work, which has started under the current programme, taking into account equality, equity and non-discrimination and develop initiatives for business, public bodies and voluntary and community sec<Col N="858" /> tor co-operation. My Department has already engaged in a wide-ranging consultation process with interested parties in the Border counties and Northern Ireland and will work closely with the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland to develop the detail of the new programme over the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his positive reply and I compliment him on his successful efforts to secure this funding at the Berlin Council. Will the Department of Finance directly involve Oireachtas Members from the Border counties when deciding on the next programme? As the Minister knows, the Oireachtas Members represent a wide range of interests and it would be useful if they were directly involved in consultations with his Department's officials in drafting the programme.</P>

      <P>A widely based representation forum was established to liaise with the monitoring committee on the implementation of the programme on both sides of the Border. The Deputy must note this is a joint programme between ourselves and the UK authorities. Some 80 per cent of the total fund will be spent on the UK side of the Border, that is, 400 million euro, and 100 million euro will be spent on this side of it. That 500 million euro represents 75 per cent of the total amount of money which will be spent. I know public representatives would like to have a greater involvement, but it is a matter which must be debated with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. I have no objection in principle to the suggestion.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his positive response. Were it not for the efforts and input of the Oireachtas Members, in consultation with the then Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, when the previous programme was being drafted, it would not have been as successful and the expenditure would not have been targeted as effectively as it has been in recent years. It is necessary to target the expenditure at capital projects, such as the provision of facilities, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and to continue with assistance for community projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any truth in the reports that there have been difficulties with the Northern Ireland authorities in agreeing on projects which might benefit from funding under the programme? Is there a difficulty, particularly in Northern Ireland, in relation to matching funds? I know the national development plan, which the Minister is due to announce next Monday, suggests a budget which will be spent on the peace programme but which does not find matching funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be careful because we are talking about two separate matters. This fund <Col N="859" /> has been in existence for some time, but a detailed operational programme has yet to be written. I take on board what Deputy Brendan Smith said because I am aware of people's frustration on the Southern side of the Border about how it operates on both sides of the Border. I will bear in mind the Deputy's suggestions, but it must be done jointly.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised a separate question about a joint chapter in the national development plan. The national development plan will be launched next Monday, but I do not want to anticipate what will be in it. It is difficult to put together a joint chapter because the UK national plan is different from our plan. It is limited, whereas our plan is broader in comparison to plans we had before which were Brussels related with co-financing. Recognising that we will get only 3 billion euro from Europe, the national plan is more broadly based and will be considerably in excess of that.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's question is separate to the question on the peace programme. Deputy Brendan Smith wants greater consultation in the peace programme and I will ask my officials to bear that in mind in the negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer price index for September showed a headline inflation rate of 1.5 per cent compared with 1.4 per cent for the previous month. The year on year increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices was 2.6 per cent in September compared with 2.4 per cent in August. The most significant price changes in the year to September were increases in services and related expenditure, plus 5.2 per cent, transport, plus 4.7 per cent, fuel and light, plus 4.1 per cent, alcoholic drinks, plus 3.7 per cent, tobacco, plus 3.2 per cent and food, plus 2.7 per cent, and decreases in housing, minus 14.1 per cent and clothing and footwear, minus 7.3 per cent.</P>
      <P>The inflation outlook will be influenced by a number of factors. On the negative side, inflation in the services sector is now running at more than 5 per cent on a year to year basis. Given the strength of the economy, a significant reduction in services inflation seems unlikely in the short run. International commodity prices are also now increasing. These have added to the CPI since March with further increases likely in the months ahead. The headline CPI will rise over the next few months as the large falls in mortgage rates at the end of 1998 begin to fall out of the year on year comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent increase in interest rates by the European Central Bank will also add to inflation. The extent of this effect will be determined by <Col N="860" /> competitive developments in the mortgage market which are difficult to gauge at this stage. There are also a number of positive developments affecting the CPI. Food price inflation is falling after the large increases at the end of 1998 resulting from supply related problems. In addition, the recent appreciation of the euro should help to dampen any prospective increases.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned on several occasions, the Government is concerned about underlying price developments and excessive growth in domestic demand. Given the new policy framework in Economic and Monetary Union, budgetary policy has an enhanced role to play in stabilising demand. This calls for a prudent approach to budgetary policy which involves running significant budgetary surpluses in buoyant economic conditions. I intend to continue with this policy in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>Pay developments are also crucial in ensuring low inflation. The Government is committed to working towards a new partnership agreement which would support appropriate pay increases having regard to the overall needs of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the objective of all economic policy to control inflation. Low inflation in recent years has contributed greatly to our economic success. Both the Deputy and I remember the times when inflation was in double digits and we followed it up with double digit wage increases which led to rising unemployment, higher taxes and a decrease in people's take home pay. In the 12 years since, we have had moderate wage increases, tax reductions, low inflation, record employment growth, falling unemployment and the elimination of the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement and we now have surpluses. We have also been able to increase the level of services to everyone. Keeping inflation under control is one of the primary objectives of this Government because we have seen the benefits of doing that and we remember the times when we did not.</P>

      <P>The forecast annual inflation rate for 1999 was originally 1.8 per cent. That figure has been revised downwards to 1.6 per cent. That is our best estimate of inflation for 1999. In my budget speech on 1 December, I will outline the general inflation rate for next year.</P>
      <P>In my reply I have given the breakdown of inflation in the recent past and the areas that contribute to pushing up inflation, which are mainly services. I have also given the factors that are bringing down inflation. The CPI headline figures would be much higher were it not for the relatively large increases in mortgage repayments over the past 12 months. Food price inflation has been relatively low due to international factors. On the other hand, the strength of the Irish economy has pushed up services related expenditure and that is highlighted in the areas to which I referred in my reply.</P>

    <P>I welcome the conclusions and recommendations in the NESC strategy report which was <Col N="862" /> prepared by the council in response to a request from the Taoiseach for a strategy report in relation to a new national programme of social partnership. The report outlines a vision for the development of Irish society over the coming decade together with a comprehensive and imaginative strategy to achieve a wide range of objectives. The report reflects the aspirations of all sectors of society by addressing the challenges faced by Ireland in the new global world economy. The recommendations, including those related to child benefit will be carefully considered by the Government in the context of budgetary preparations, in the discussions on a successor agreement to Partnership 2000 and as an input to other important policy decisions in the years ahead.</P>

Few industries have been brought in from outside and road structures are difficult. Is the Minister aware of the difficulties which exist in those areas? Only 20 per cent of money from funds such as those I have mentioned is spent on the southern side of the Border. Some Members of the House appear to think Border counties are given large amounts of funding, but we do not get as much as is believed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to vehicle registration tax and excise duty on motor fuels. Vehicle registration tax is a valuable source of funding, contributing approximately £463 million to the Exchequer in 1998. It was introduced on 1 January 1993 and replaced the previous motor vehicle excise duty which was abolished under the EU Single Market rules. Vehicle registration tax is payable on the first registration of a vehicle in the State and applies to both new cars purchased in the State and used cars brought in from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I restructured VRT rates on cars in last year's budget. The new structure favours smaller cars. As I said at the time, it is appropriate to seek to recoup revenue in this way from a sector experiencing record sales. I <Col N="863" /> also said that the increases in VRT would yield a contribution from the motoring sector to meet the additional road use and environmental damage arising from the unprecedented growth in private car numbers and usage.</P>
    <P>At that time many people claimed that the restructuring of VRT would be disastrous for the motor industry. However, car sales have continued to rise. Total net registrations for the first three quarters of the year are 20 per cent ahead of the same period last year and almost 10 per cent ahead of last year's full year total. Exchequer receipts from VRT to the end of September 1999 are up to £535.8 million. The increase in market share for cars up to 1,400 cc's &ndash; up from 57 per cent in 1998 to 64 per cent at the end of September 1999 &ndash; would seem to demonstrate that the VRT changes have had the desired effect.</P>
    <P>With regard to excise duty on motor fuels, the rate in Great Britain and Northern Ireland is much higher than that currently obtaining in the State. For example, the pump price of a litre of unleaded petrol for a person resident in the State is around 63p whereas it is around 87p in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worried about the dealer so much as the motorist. Is the Minister aware that of every £10 a motorist spends on petrol £6.50 comes back to the Exchequer in taxes and that the addition of tax to the pre-sale price of an average car is approximately 73 per cent? Taxation on the Irish motorist is now one of the highest in Europe. The motor trade has proposed that VRT be reduced on cars that meet the stringent EU requirements on air pollution and so on. Will the Minister consider reducing VRT on these cars in the Finance Bill, for environmental reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the pre-budget submission from the Irish motoring industry which refers to this matter. As usual, all such submissions will be taken into account in preparing the budget. The Deputy has made this case regarding taxation and the Irish motorist on previous occasions. He made it very forcefully when changes were made in VRT in last year's budget. At that time, despite prognostications from many people in the motor industry that the measure would be disastrous for the industry, I predicted that sales would rise, and so they have.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan refers to the high rate of VRT and the heavy excise duty on petrol. We must remember that money must be collected to run the State. We must provide hospital and other services, pay pensions and pay for policing and all the other requirements of a modern State. It is not possible to reduce taxation levels in all areas.</P>

While up to ten banks expressed an initial interest in acquiring the bank, only three firm indications of interest were received. Subsequently, two of these banks withdrew from the sale process and only one final bid, submitted by Bank of Ireland, was received by the deadline of 19 October 1999. Last week I confirmed Bank of Ireland as the preferred bidder and it is now undertaking final due diligence on ICC Bank following which final negotiations will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this exercise has been completed I intend to bring my proposals on the matter to Government for a decision. In deciding on the future of ICC Bank, I will take into account the <Col N="865" /> long-term interest of all the stakeholders &ndash; the company itself, the staff, the customers and suppliers, and the shareholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that, in circumstances where there is only one bidder, the State receives the full value of the company? When he talks about further negotiations taking place after the due diligence, is that simply negotiations about the transfer or will the price issue arise again?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that an increasingly small number of players seem to be involved in banking in Ireland? If this was a private company being acquired by the Bank of Ireland, no doubt it would be referred to the Tánaiste's office to see if an undue portion of the market was being taken by one big player. Will there be a reference to the Tánaiste's office to examine what portion of the banking market Bank of Ireland will have subsequent to this takeover?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three separate questions. On the question raised regarding whether the full value will be received by the State, this was widely advertised and initially there were expressions from ten bidders. The next process was that they were given some information. After that, there were only three bidders. When it came to the final date, there was only one bidder. That was the process. What was going to happen was set out at the start. I had hoped there would be more than one bidder at this stage, but then the decision was made to give them further information and the last bidder, Bank of Ireland, must undertake further due diligence.</P>
      <P>One of the Deputy's questions related to the small number of players on the Irish financial scene. I am sure the attraction of ICC Bank for a number of the bidders looking at it in the first instance would be its niche in the market in which it works and that will have been taken into account by all the bidders when they looked at this opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's last question referred to the possibility in the final analysis of this being referred to the Competition Authority. When this final part is dealt with by the preferred bidder, Bank of Ireland, I will bring my final proposals to Government and make a decision at that stage on what I will then do, taking into account the interests of all the stakeholders in this operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was reported in the press last week as having said that he felt consolidation within the banking sector was in a sense an appropriate defence mechanism against the possibility of largescale takeover of the retail banking sector by foreign interests and by foreign owned banks. Does that reflect the Minister's view or does he take the view that we need as many players as possible to ensure competition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister committed to selling ICC Bank come what may, or could he envisage circum<Col N="866" /> stances where he would recommend to Government that the sale does not proceed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I was reported correctly last week in referring to aspects of the banking sector, and I referred to this matter when I addressed the institute of bankers on last Thursday night and previously in an interview which I gave to <i>Business and Finance</i>. I said I was undertaking a strategic review of the banking sector here because there are a number of issues which pertain which are unique to the Irish situation. The two main institutions are very large in an Irish context but in a European-wide sphere they are very small. As has happened in other countries, perhaps we will wake up in five or six years and find that the banks, which we refer to as the Irish banks, are no longer under Irish control in the sense that their headquarters and staff are not located here. Someone at that stage might say &ldquo;How did that happen overnight? We should have done some thinking about it.&rdquo;. I said in the interview and I repeated in my address to the institute of bankers that I do not have a fixed view as to how we should progress. I certainly want competition in the banking sector, but one must remember that Ireland is very small in European and world contexts. Those and other issues should be teased out at this stage and some thinking should be done, and that is why I am undertaking the strategic review. That is one aspect of the strategic review which should be faced up to at this stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's second question was: will I sell ICC Bank, come what may? I stated in reply to Deputy Noonan's question that when this process of final due diligence is undertaken by the preferred bidder and in the light of all the information then, I will make a recommendation to the Government, but it is correct to say and I have said so on numerous occasions that I do not see a long-term future for the State involvement in the banking sector, not only with ICC Bank but also with ACC Bank. I stated that previously in this House and outside, and it is still my view.</P>

      <P>We put in train a number of procedures before we started out in this area. I have advisers, who advise me, but the sale price of anything, as the Deputy will be well aware, is what a person is willing to pay. The Deputy might think his house in Limerick is worth so much but he will never know until he puts it up for public auction. In this instance, I have put ICC Bank up for public auction. We initially had indications of ten bidders, it was reduced to three and now it is reduced to one. Therefore, the value of ICC Bank is what the market determines on foot of public tender-auction.</P>

      <Quest>the number of prosecutions taken under section 11 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, in each subsequent year to date; the number of cases sent to the DPP for decisions on prosecutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear which precise offence the Deputy has in mind in relation to prosecution. Section 11 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, deals with penalties for certain types of tax offences committed after the passage of the 1993 legislation. The type of offences covered include, for example, making a false statement in order to obtain an allowance. It is section 9 of the Act which creates offences for breaches of the amnesty itself.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that none of the 16 prosecutions for serious tax evasion taken to date since 1993 have relied specifically on either of these sections.</P>
      <P>I understand from the commissioners that a significant number of cases are currently under investigation for possible prosecution. The commissioners have assured me that when an amnesty case suitable for prosecution is identified and sufficient evidence is available, proceedings will be initiated.</P>
      <P>The 16 cases to which I referred, which relate to a variety of tax offences, were in the following years: one in 1994, one in 1996, four in 1997, five in 1998 and five in 1999 to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the question was essentially to find out whether there is a mechanism which allows the Revenue Commissioners and ultimately the DPP to go behind the certificate which was issued to taxpayers when they made a settlement under the amnesty Act. Can the Minister confirm that there is such a procedure, that it is open to the Revenue to look behind that certificate and, therefore, that it is open to them to make prosecutions under the Act because clearly very few prosecutions have been initiated to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As already stated, the sections that relate to prosecutions have not been used. <Col N="868" /> Section 1078 is more widely used for prosecutions. Previously, section 94 of the Finance Act, 1983, was the main mechanism used for criminal prosecutions. This section covers offences committed in respect of all the main taxes administered by Revenue, including income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax and value added tax. Section 11, to which the Deputy's question refers, deals with penalties for offences that relate to the making of false statements to obtain an allowance. As already stated, however, section 1078 is more commonly used.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's supplementary question, the Revenue Commissioners, under the 1993 Act, have powers to go beyond the terms of the amnesty if they need to do so and if a taxpayer has not complied with the full provisions of the amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My specific question relates to section 11, which is somewhat broader than the Minister indicated because it deals with declarations made for the purpose of obtaining any allowance, reduction, rebate or repayment of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I have no desire to quibble with the Minister in that regard. In what circumstances would the Revenue Commissioners seek to go beyond the certificate? Is the Minister satisfied they have shown due diligence, in so far as is possible, in acting on suspicions they might harbour or information they might have been given which suggests that someone has not made a full declaration of tax due?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the operations of the Revenue Commissioners in terms of the way they prosecute cases. In recent years a separate unit dealing with this matter was established but it is not as easy as people might believe. A number of grounds must be established before a criminal prosecution can be mounted. The Deputy will be aware of that from his experience as a solicitor. The Revenue Commissioners cannot prosecute someone unless there are clear grounds that the case can be won. The Revenue has a very active prosecution policy in train, but certain procedures must be undergone before a prosecution can be mounted.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the progress, if any, made in agreeing a package for harmonising tax and eradicating others which are considered harmful to competition; and his views on whether this harmonisation package would affect the attraction of industry to Ireland.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22183/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1998, the Vienna European Council called for agreement to be reached on a tax package by the Helsinki Euro<Col N="869" /> pean Council in December 1999. This commitment was reaffirmed at the Cologne Summit in June 1999. The three key items of the tax package are: a code of conduct on business taxation; proposals for a directive on the taxation of income from savings; and proposals for a directive on the taxation of interest and royalty payments between companies.</P>
      <P>A key element of the tax package is the code of conduct. The code of conduct is a political agreement designed to curb harmful competition in business taxation. It focuses on national tax measures which have a significant effect on the location of business within the Union and which provide for a significantly lower effective rate than the rate generally applying in the member state in question. Such measures, be they applied by law, regulation or administrative practice, are regarded as potentially harmful under the code. Measures which are found to be actually harmful under the code are to be rolled back over a period of up to five years, though a longer period may be allowed in certain circumstances. There is also a &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; clause whereby member states agree not to introduce any new harmful measures.</P>
      <P>The code of conduct does not define what is harmful as such, but it sets out various criteria by which measures are to be evaluated, including whether the tax benefits are confined to non-residents and ring-fenced from the domestic economy, whether the benefits are granted without substantial economic activity taking place and whether there is a lack of transparency. The code suggests that member states should aim to adopt principles targeted at abolishing harmful tax measures on as broad a geographical basis as possible.</P>
      <P>The code of conduct does not apply to general tax rates such as the 12.5 per cent corporate rate and the transitional provisions being put in place to move from the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the 12.5 per cent rate are fully consistent with the code.</P>
      <P>Discussions are continuing on the code with a view to meeting the deadline for a report to the Helsinki European Council and progress has been made in delineating the main issues to be resolved. Improving tax policy co-ordination in the European Union, which Ireland supports, is not to be confused with harmonisation of tax rates which is not on the EU agenda. This was confirmed at the Vienna European Council, the agreed conclusions of which stated that &ldquo;co-operation in the tax policy area is not aiming at uniform tax rates and is not inconsistent with fair tax competition, but is called for to reduce the continuing distortions in the Single Market, to prevent excessive losses of tax revenue or to get tax structures to develop in a more employment-friendly way&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, which will increase to 12.5 per cent in the near future, has <Col N="870" /> been one of the instruments of policy which has led to the industrialisation of modern Ireland? Does he also agree there is a great deal of confusion regarding the various directives governing the harmonisation of taxation practice which are being discussed in the run-up to the Helsinki meeting? Will the Minister give an assurance to those who invest in Ireland and to the wider Irish business sector that there is nothing on the horizon in Europe which runs counter to our national policy of introducing a corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent and of maintaining it for the foreseeable future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan's assertion that the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax has been one of the key determinants of Irish economic success in recent decades. It has been a major component in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland. Some foreign commentators would like to give the impression that it is the main reason for Irish economic success, but I am sure Deputies on all sides agree this is not the case.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's second question related to tax harmonisation. At the ECOFIN Council meeting on 1 December 1997 we agreed to resolve three matters within three years, namely, to formulate a code of conduct on business taxation, to progress the tax and savings directive and to deal with the interests and royalties directive. These three items were regarded as part of the same package.</P>
      <P>We have had considerable difficulty recently in moving forward on the tax and savings directive. A meeting on this matter took place earlier in the week and no progress was made. We will strive to ensure it is dealt with at the Helsinki Council, but if last Monday's meeting is indicative, we will have considerable difficulty in this regard.</P>
      <P>The code of conduct on business taxation does not refer to harmonisation, it relates to distortion of the marketplace. As stated in the last part of my original reply, the agreed conclusions of the Vienna European Council specifically stated that it does not mean harmonised tax rates.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's final question related to assurances regarding the future. There is nothing on the immediate horizon to place in jeopardy Ireland's move to a 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate for all new operations on 1 January 2003, as agreed by the Commission. When the code of conduct report is published, it will list that rate but since we have agreed this procedure we will face no difficulties. I can give an assurance in that regard to companies that wish to establish operations in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated previously, it is my view that, for a number of years, the entire focus in Europe has concentrated on Ireland and its low 10 per cent rate. Recent budgets introduced by other European Finance Ministers recognise the folly of having high corporation tax rates and they are considering reducing them. More than 18 months ago I stated that Europe would move more towards <Col N="871" /> the Irish position. That said, however, I doubt whether some member states will discontinue the practice of raising the question of tax harmonisation in the future. Despite what I said earlier, some countries, for ideological and other reasons, desire the introduction of harmonised tax rates.</P>
    <P>I do not believe unity will ever be achieved among members of the European Council regarding the harmonisation of taxes. I predict the emphasis will lie in the other direction. There are some countries which will not give up the idea of harmonisation.</P>

      <P>This call, which was made at a recent SIPTU conference on employee financial participation at which I also spoke, was in respect of a major tax package to encourage all forms of employee financial participation &ndash; share ownership, gain sharing, profit related pay etc. &ndash; in both the private and public sectors. However, the call did not contain any specific proposals. In my speech to the conference I explained the Government's ongoing support for employee share ownership schemes which encourage greater partnership at the level of the firm thereby improving the performance of the company, its profits and widening share ownership.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of pre-budget proposals from various organisations and companies concerning employee share schemes and profit sharing and, as is the case with all pre-budget submissions, the matters raised will be borne in mind in the preparation of the forthcoming budget.</P>

I am aware of the criticism made by Dr. Went and others of certain restrictions in this area and those will be borne in mind in the preparation of next year's Finance Bill. Everyone is very much in fav<Col N="872" /> our of gain sharing and profit sharing. This and previous Governments have tried over the years to develop new concepts of achieving that within the taxation code. That being said, it is proving difficult to marry the objectives of encouraging gain sharing through the tax structure and ensuring that reliefs are not abused. Certain reliefs are mainly confined to high income taxpayers and it would be to the detriment of equity in the tax system to introduce more. However, I am willing to listen to all new ideas in the context of the tax code for next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is familiar with share option schemes in a variety of companies. Is he aware that when an employee realises the value of the shares by way of sale, the gain between the option price and the selling price is treated as a benefit-in-kind and taxed at 45 per cent rather than being treated as a capital gain and being taxed at 20 per cent? The Minister will realise that this is a major disincentive. What appears to be an attractive share option scheme on the face of it becomes very unattractive at disposal. Is he aware that it is anomalous that if the same employee had shares in a third party company, he would be taxed at 20 per cent on any capital gains but, because he has shares in his own company, the effective tax rate is 46 per cent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is not any reason in principle why share holding schemes in State companies &ndash; ESOPs &ndash; should not now be extended to all State companies rather than used as an implement to facilitate privatisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle I cannot see any objection to that, but ESOPs were set in train in the light of changed structures in these semi-State companies in the instances so far. That is the way the system developed until now. As I said to the conference to which the question refers, I am not against looking at more innovative ways of extending the concept of gain sharing but I will really believe that gain sharing has come of age in the public service when the civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs are involved in an ESOP scheme. Then we will know that we have come of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all questions together.</P>
      <P>I first extend my sincere sympathy to the family of the deceased. The death of a young member of a family is particularly tragic and the grief can only be heightened by the fact that his death occurred in prison. The family have asked that personal details be not released and that they be allowed to grieve in private and I intend to respect their request.</P>
      <P>In common with the recent death in custody in Wheatfield, the deceased hanged himself in his cell using a bed sheet. He was accommodated in a double cell and his cell mate raised the alarm. Attempts were made to resuscitate him. He was taken by ambulance to hospital where he was pronounced dead. There was no prior indication of the risk of self harm and he was not under special observation. He had been examined by the prison medical officer on the day following his committal and further treatment or appointments were not required.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware this is the third death in custody to have taken place over the past four weeks. Every such death is a tragedy for the family, relatives and friends of the deceased and also for the prison service. As I have explained to the House before, there are procedures in place to prevent suicides in each prison. However, the possibility of suicides in custody cannot be completely prevented without the total denial of personal privacy to prisoners at all times.</P>
      <P>All deaths in custody are investigated by the Garda and are the subject of an inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest. The preventative measures in place to deter suicides are under continuous review. The suicide awareness group in each prison examines closely the circumstances of each death in custody. The purpose of their examinations is to identify, where possible, measures which might be taken in the future to contribute to the prevention of tragic deaths of this nature. This is an important mechanism for absorbing the lessons to be learned in each case.</P>

    <P>Some offenders present a special risk of self-harm and there are procedures in place to identify and monitor them. These offenders are usually placed under special observation when <Col N="874" /> locked in their cells. In spite of our best efforts, we cannot escape the fact that where an offender is determined to take his or her life the scope for prevention is limited. Unfortunately, suicide is not a completely preventable act in a free society or in a prison system which accords any respect to the personal dignity and privacy of prisoners.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the report of the National Steering Group on Deaths in Prisons last May. The group, which was established under the chairmanship of a senior prison governor, comprised representatives of various disciplines involved in the care of prisoners. They had been assigned the task of reviewing and overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the advisory group on prison deaths published in 1991. The group reported that there are sound policies in place and a high level of awareness among prison staff in regard to suicide awareness. It also reported that many deaths are possibly averted by the alertness and vigilance of staff.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of its report, I invited the group to continue to meet on a regular basis to provide a forum for collating the reports of the local suicide awareness groups within the institutions and disseminate significant findings and lessons learned through the prison system. It was also invited to organise an annual forum for the suicide awareness groups in each institution. The first such forum took place recently.</P>
    <P>The occurrence of the three recent tragic deaths in our prisons within a short time is a matter of concern. While the circumstances of each death are being reviewed individually by the prisons concerned, I have asked the director general of the Prison Service to have the circumstances of all three deaths reviewed collectively to determine whether there were any common features which can be identified in the interest of putting in place whatever additional measures may be required to build on the already comprehensive suicide prevention measures being taken at each prison. The director general assures me that, to this end, he will convene an immediate meeting of the National Steering Group on Deaths in Prisons to undertake this task and report as a matter of urgency. He is fully committed to ensuring that all possible measures are in place to prevent deaths in our prisons and has my full support in this most important work.</P>

        <b>:</b> I also offer my sincere sympathy to the family of the deceased young man following their tragic loss. Given that there has been five prison suicides since the beginning of the year &ndash; three occurred in the past month while two occurred in the past week &ndash; does the Minister agree that it is a clear indication that the prison medical, psychological and psychiatric services are simply not up to par? Does he realise that the young man who hanged himself at Wheatfield Prison last week had already attempted suicide on two previous occasions and, according to his mother when she appeared on <Col N="875" /> RTE recently, had not been offered any counselling? Apart from the medical report which essentially deals with the physical well-being of a prisoner when he enters prison, was there any psychiatric assessment of this prisoner? If not, why not?</P>

      <P>Each prisoner presenting himself at a prison is examined by a prison doctor and that procedure was not departed from in this instance. The deceased was examined by a doctor in the prison as per usual. It was not deemed necessary for him to receive psychiatric treatment and, therefore, he did not receive any. There were not any indications from the information available to me that he was disturbed to the extent that he might attempt to take his own life, which, tragically, he subsequently did.</P>

      <P>I convey my sympathy to the family of the young man. He resided in my constituency and came from a good and caring family. It is understood that he was serving a short sentence and I respect the fact that personal details should not be discussed. I accept that prisoners are examined by medical officers when they enter prison. However, are previous records sought relating to prisoners in order to ascertain whether they might be expected to make an attempt on their lives or to ascertain whether they have psychiatric problems or suffer from depression?</P>
      <P>The proposals to redesign cells, particularly in older prisons, were put forward to counteract any suicide attempts. Have those measures been put in place? While I accept that in this case the prisoner was not in a cell on his own &ndash; and that is an important factor in this regard &ndash; proposals were made by the National Steering Group on Deaths in Prisons. Were they implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The prisoner in question was examined by a doctor and the doctor deemed him to be fit and well. On that basis, it was not considered necessary for him to obtain or receive psychiatric treatment. The deceased would have been asked certain questions by the doctor in regard to his medical record and if anything had come to light the doctor would have taken whatever action he deemed necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An elaborate strategy is in place to prevent suicides in prisons but unless there is to be a total denial of personal privacy to all prisoners at all times the possibility of suicide in custody simply cannot be precluded, no more, indeed, than it can be in the wider community and, unfortunately, that is the position. Offenders who are identified as being at risk are given special attention by prison staff with the specific objective of preventing self-injury. The procedures for identifying and providing for offenders at risk are kept under continuous review and all measures which can reasonably be taken to help in a specific case are taken immediately. Where a person is determined <Col N="876" /> to take his or her own life, frequently there is not a prior warning of any such intent and there are limits, unfortunately, to what the prison authorities can reasonably do.</P>
    <P>A special suicide prevention circular has issued to all prisons. It emphasises the importance of suicide prevention policy, sets out clear procedures to be followed in all institutions and identifies the responsibilities of all staff in regard to suicide prevention policy. It deals in a clear and specific manner with immediate on the spot responses to particular types of self-injury, for instance, hanging or cutting of the throat. Special training has been provided for prison staff who are medical orderlies, in the first aid techniques in treating such self-injuries and in resuscitation techniques generally. Particular emphasis is placed on identification of suicide risk cases by the circular on prison management . Prisoners who are identified as a suicide risk, for whatever reason, are put on a special observation list which is notified to, and regularly reviewed by the prison medical officer, who is the GP attached to the prison, the prison governor and the relevant chief officer in the prison.</P>
    <P>Prisoners such as these are checked in their cells every 15 to 20 minutes after they are locked up for the night and a special element of the training package for prison officers deals with special observation issues. As a last resort, where a prisoner is regarded as being in extreme danger of committing suicide he or she is confined to a special cell known colloquially as a &ldquo;padded&rdquo; cell where the scope for self-injury is extremely limited. No inmate would be held longer than overnight in such a cell without the involvement in his or her case of the prison medical officer and it would be highly unusual for a person to spend more than 48 hours in such a cell. The use of special cells is an extreme measure and is only invoked as a last resort but it can and does act as an effective short-term expedient to contain a prisoner who is intent on seriously injuring himself or herself. Deputy O'Sullivan also asked what was the position on the recommendations of the national steering group on deaths in prisons. It found that of the 57 recommendations in the 1991 report, 34 were fully implemented and 15 were partially implemented. The Director of Prison Service, Mr. Aylward, is currently pursuing the remainder as a matter of urgency.</P>

        <b>:</b> How can the Minister credibly tell the House that prisoners who are deemed to be prone to suicide attempts are subject to special measures and special observation when the young man, who was found hanged last week, had attempted suicide &ndash; according to his mother &ndash; on two separate occasions and had not been given any counselling? Will he accept that in suicide cases there are invariably tell-tale signs that should be picked up if the services exist? In this case there would have been some indication, if the necessary psychiatric and psychological services had been in place. This young man came <Col N="877" /> from Limerick and was sentenced to three months in Mountjoy jail. Why was consideration not given to accommodating him in a prison much nearer home, for example, Limerick prison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Every possible step is taken by the prison authorities to try to minimise the risk of suicides. It can be fairly said that the vast majority of suicide attempts in prisons are prevented as a result of the measures in place. This matter is taken seriously by the prison authorities and the medical staff in every grade. Clearly, it is not possible, without denying an individual's total privacy or without denying the individual even a limited amount of freedom, for one to be absolutely certain an individual will not take his or her life. The best that can be done is being done to the best of the ability of the prison authorities; of that I am certain. However, if there are improvements which can be made, those improvements will certainly be made. The Director General of the Prison Service, for example, has instructed the national group to look at the recent three suicides collectively to see if there are some common threads which can be picked out and upon which we can build greater preventive measures. It is a particularly difficult area and Deputy Higgins will appreciate that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the young man who received a short prison sentence the family do not want me to go into details. Clearly the sentencing of the young man concerned was a matter for the courts. They made their decision. On no account should it go out from this House that this is a problem which is swept under the carpet by the prison authorities. Everything that can be done is done to try to ensure people do not take their own lives while in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Young men will often put on, what I might call, a macho front. Despite the fact that they may be examined by a medical officer on arriving at the prison, they may not display suicidal or depressive tendencies whereas that would possibly be indicated in medical records. Medical records should be sought in respect of prisoners immediately they enter prison because they may not display such signs in a medical examination. The report from the group indicated that on average only about a minute is spent by prisoners, in many prisons, with the medical officers. There may not be sufficient time to speak to a prisoner.</P>
      <P>Where there is a suicide, do fellow prisoners receive counselling? Obviously a suicide has a serious effect on other prisoners, particularly the cell mate in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The prisoner is seen within a period of 24 hours of his arrival in prison by the doctor. Obviously an examination takes place. In this instance the doctor deemed the young man to be fit and well. In regard to the records of the young man concerned, my information is that the doctor would have questioned him and if he was <Col N="878" /> concerned about his mental health he would certainly have referred him for help to a psychiatrist and or a psychologist. That did not happen in this case for the reason I have outlined, that is that the doctor deemed the young man fit and well. As it subsequently transpired, unfortunately, the young man took his own life. Clearly that is a matter of considerable regret for me as Minister and for the prison authorities. I have outlined that it is not possible &ndash; everybody, I think, understands this &ndash; to ensure an individual will not take his or her life in custody no more than it can be ensured outside. All one can do is minimise the risk of it happening. In so far as that can be done it is done.</P>

      <P>I too extend my sympathy to the family of the bereaved, the prison staff and the other prisoners in the prison. A suicide is an extremely traumatic event for anybody. What changes have taken place in the past two years given that the national task force on suicide, which reported less than two years ago, expressed extreme concern about the level of organisation of mental health services provided in the prison system? It stated that there is a need to augment significantly the existing provision of what could be considered the caring services in the prison environment, for example, the medical services, which include psychiatric and psychological services. Will the Minister outline what action has been taken in view of that strong recommendation by the national task force, bearing in mind that prisoners are five times more likely to be suicidal than the general population?</P>

      <P>That would include recent years. Eight longer-term recommendations were not fully implemented. The Director General of the Prison Service is pursuing their implementation as a matter of urgency. The steering group identified a number of priority issues, including the establishment of a high support facility in each of the closed institutions for prisoners exhibiting suicidal tendencies and the establishment of an assessment centre, such as that which will exist in the new remand prison in Clover Hill. The group recommended the co-ordination of information from the local suicide awareness groups within each institution and intergovernmental agencies as well as the appointment of a pharmacist to oversee the control and dispensing of drugs in prisons, in addition to employing qualified nurses. In December 1998, I established a group to examine and report on the future needs, structure and organisation of the psychology service, about which I have concerns. Its report is being <Col N="879" /> reviewed. The service is recruiting extra staff. I do not want to pre-empt publication of the report but it is my intention to improve the service. Currently a service is provided for prisoners by professionally qualified staff based in the Department who service the prisons on a call out and regular appointment basis. On taking office it was clear that the future needs, structure and organisation of the service needed to be examined. It was in that context that I sought the report of the group which is being reviewed and will be published in the near future. In the meantime, I will continue to recruit the additional staff required.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister realise the committal sheet to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred is only one page, that it contains a set of basic questions and that no medical report is required? Will he ensure this inadequate admissions procedure is rectified immediately? The man concerned was serving a three month sentence for a relatively minor offence. Does the Minister acknowledge that we have a crazy prison philosophy given that over half of those in prison are serving sentences of three months or less? Rather than send to prison persons who should never be there, the Department's tackling crime document, the Whitaker report, the sociological and criminological profile of Mountjoy Prison &ndash; the document obtained by the criminologist, Paul O'Mahony &ndash; and my alternatives to prison all push in the direction of sensible enlightened penal policies where prisoners would be enabled to repay their debts to society by way of community service orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>When a prisoner is committed to prison he or she is met by prison staff at reception and asked, as Deputy Higgins said, to complete a committal sheet seeking the usual statistical information &ndash; the person's name, address, age and so on. The offender is allowed to telephone his or her next of kin and asked to hand over personal belongings. Every offender admitted to prison is then seen and examined by a doctor who makes a professional judgment to the best of his or her ability. That is what happened in this case. Neither I nor the prison authorities can make this assessment. Each and every prisoner is dealt with in a humane and sensitive way. It is a different argument whether a person should be sentenced to prison, that is the preserve and constitutional obligation of the courts. It is not a matter for me or the prison authorities. That is the way things are. In normal circumstances each individual is seen and assisted in so far as possible by a probation and welfare officer before being admitted to prison. We are trying to improve on the current position. I outlined in reply to Deputy Neville what I am trying to do in the psychology service. I will make whatever other improvements are required. The usual investigations will be conducted in this case by the Garda Síochána, the coroner and the Director <Col N="880" /> General of the Prison Service. The national steering group has been asked to examine the three most recent cases collectively. While everything humanly possible will be and is being done to prevent prisoners taking their lives in custody, it is virtually impossible for any Minister to assure the House that it will not happen again. That is the tragic situation. I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of the young man concerned and the families of the other two persons who died in custody in recent weeks. It a traumatic time for the families concerned. All we can do is our level best to try to ensure the risk of it happening again is minimised to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <P>It is important in this age of change in the art of communication that the broadcasting Acts are amended and updated to ensure the changed opportunities are maximised to their full potential. The technological development of communications systems is continuing at a rapid pace. These changes continue to have a profound effect on the quality of reception and, more importantly, on the quality of receipt due to the ever increasing capacity of systems, particularly digital television, to receive so many channel options. The Minister referred to the capacity of systems perceived previously as broadcasting platforms only to provide services for the information society age. The age of instant communication opens many doors, some of which are of great value while others have potential for negative influences on the progress of people, yet we must fight shy of indulging in the restriction or over-exercise of censorship. Getting the balance right is important. We must ensure that progress made in the technology area is maximised fully to the benefit of all the public. We must ensure equality of access and that the full range of services is available to all. We must not put artificial barriers in place to stop the most exciting adventure opportunity which is opening up to everyone, irrespective of age, but in opening these doors we must be prepared to face challenges and enable people to have a real choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that our national broadcaster reflects the social and cultural values of the people but in doing so, the standard of production and the quality of presentation must be able to compete with that which is available on the multiplicity of other channels these modern broadcasting services provide. It is important that everyone realises the full capacity of television to educate and influence cultural change. The most simple television &ldquo;soaps&rdquo; are powerful shapers of <Col N="882" /> attitudes in society and form the benchmark of standards which apply to everyday life. This powerful tool can have a very positive influence on how our nation develops. It is important that care and skill is encouraged in the production of the programmes provided by the national service.</P>
    <P>Having account of the higher focus on pay per view, which is developing with the increased range of channels, it is important that RTE remains as a free to air channel with a full and diverse programme schedule which has something for everyone. No one must be excluded from reasonable access. The DTT platform must be available to both public and private broadcasters while also providing access to the Internet and other interactive services which may develop. We are dealing with a powerful weapon; the ability to change and influence public attitudes on a global scale while people sit in the comfort of their own homes. The technology revolution is but a simple television set which will now become the source of views, news, shopping, etc. We must not be afraid of the developments but ensure we harness them so that they may contribute to a better and more caring world.</P>
    <P>Section 14 seeks objectivity and impartiality in news broadcasting. A recent trend in news delivery seems to be that the reporter decides to be the news generator, on occasions endeavouring to negotiate between unions and employers, pre-empting the work of the Labour Court and other professional negotiators. If this trend continues, it will lead to a sorry mess. There is a difference in news generation, news delivery and investigative reporting. They require different skills and abilities but, unfortunately, some people do not appear to have them.</P>
    <P>This is a good opportunity to pay tribute to local radio. The people involved are doing an excellent job and they must be congratulated. Local radio allows good interaction with the community. It raises local issues and debates them. NEAR FM, in my constituency of Dublin North East, provides a valuable service to local representatives who use the radio to inform their constituents of what is happening in the community. It also allows them to interact with their constituents and obtain their views. I congratulate the people involved in North East Access Radio for the excellent programmes they air. Recently we had a prize-giving ceremony in Baldoyle for people from the local community who had set up an excellent facility in which people could train in computers, television appearances, etc. The entire ceremony was broadcast live on the local radio and it was greatly appreciated by those who participated in the courses and the public generally. Local radio is essential because matters which affect communities can be debated and it also gives local people an opportunity to air their views and perhaps influence public opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Dublin Deputies complain about not having access to the Dublin media so I am delighted that the local radio is so kind to my <Col N="883" /> colleague, Deputy Cosgrave. I am sure he provides them with an excellent service when he goes on air.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill which seeks to address many issues that have arisen as a result of the rapid changes in broadcasting due to the advent of digital technology. Ultimately, the Bill should ensure that we have a competitive and independent broadcasting sector and that the viewers have greater choice and superior quality to that which they have experienced to date. While I welcome the publication of the Bill, I regret that it has taken so long to reach the floor of the House. It is a Bill which needs much discussion and many amendments will be required on Committee Stage to address its weaknesses.</P>
      <P>RTE has provided an excellent service to the public for almost four decades and it has played a central role in the development of the State. One could argue whether it leads or follows, and the changes in society can be mirrored from Maggie and Benjy and the Morris Minor to Dick Moran and the drinks cabinet. A short time ago, topics now discussed on afternoon programmes on RTE 1, Network 2 or even TG4 would have brought the country to a standstill. They no longer even warrant comment. That is not necessarily a good thing as the screen image, in many cases, has led to a false perception.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly acknowledged that the major problem with legislating in this area is the pace and advance of technological change and development. The application of digital techniques will revolutionise broadcasting and due to these advances it is no longer possible to examine broadcasting in isolation as it is now converging with other forms of telecommunications and information services.</P>
      <P>Radio and television are the most powerful mass media to which we have access, and it is imperative that the needs of economics and technology can be balanced with cultural and social needs to ensure that everyone will benefit from the proposed changes. While the commercial aspect is certainly important if the industry is to survive, it is essential that a positive as opposed to a negative influence is achieved. Quality, not quantity, is the essence. I regret to say I seldom watch television as the life of a politician is not conducive to such pleasures. We only have access to the indigenous channels in our household but on the occasions I have flicked through the channels on someone else's television, I am struck by the blandness of it all as there is only a slight variation in the programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that our viewers can gain access to material of a distinctive Irish character, and the history of RTE has shown that programmes of such nature often attract the biggest audiences. The general public is not very familiar with the way we run our broadcasting services and their only contact is the payment of the licence. I agree with the principle of this payment but we require <Col N="884" /> a more transparent account of the way it is expended. The Bill does not achieve this and I hope this aspect can be addressed later on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of the aims of the Bill is to put in place a regulatory structure that allows private sector broadcasting and public broadcasters to co-exist in harmony. A level playing pitch is required to permit such a development. While I believe the private sector stations do not have a difficulty with the concept of the licence fee, they may on occasion be a little apprehensive as to the manner in which it is used. Perhaps that apprehension is well founded. It should not be used as an economic aid by the public broadcasters when they enter into competition with the private sector. A satisfactory system of accountability needs to be put in place to ensure this is so. State monopolies often do not benefit a service or an industry and the competition is to be welcomed. In the past few months, the growth of TV3's audience has resulted in RTE endeavouring to improve its product. Such changes are always welcome. TV3 has made a submission to the Minister's office, in which it has expressed concern about RTE's participation in the proposed Digico. TV3 claims this is inappropriate and may conflict with RTE's primary role as a public service broadcaster. I hope the Minister can address those concerns.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, TG4 will obtain an independence, with an obligation to provide news and current affairs programmes primarily in the Irish language. I am not sure this was the intention of the people who drove this project initially. However, perhaps economic reality has had a major influence. TG4 is to be congratulated on its broadcasting of the local football and hurling championships. It was a brave step which has been rewarded, as many viewers tune in on Sundays. My very young children show a far more imaginative response to TG4's Irish dance and music programmes than to the popcorn munching &ldquo;Home and Away&rdquo; or Bart Simpson.</P>
    <P>The net result of digital terrestrial broadcasting will be better sound quality and clearer reception, irrespective of distance from the transmitter. I hope that will benefit some of my constituents in some townlands in Wicklow who cannot receive RTE 1 satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The Bill also restates the public service broadcasting remit under which RTE operates. The protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty recognised the need to preserve media pluralism, while at the same time addressing the democratic, social and cultural needs of each society. However, the public service remit in this Bill is, at best, hazy and needs to be more refined and defined.</P>
    <P>The Minister detailed how the newly established Broadcasting Commission of Ireland shall draw up a scheme for the disbursement by it of a fund of £0.5 million, provided from the Exchequer, in respect of capital expenditure on transmission infrastructure incurred by local and community radio stations. In common with many <Col N="885" /> of my colleagues, I will take this opportunity to plug my local radio station. I hope the commission will see fit to allocate some of this funding to East Coast Radio, which has gone to great lengths and expense to overcome transmission difficulties caused by the barrier of the Wicklow mountains.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the repeal of a section of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, which enables the Independent Radio and Television Commission to impose a levy and income on independent broadcasters. Local radio provides a great service to a large number of people.</P>
    <P>I may have missed it, but I was surprised there was no reference in the Minister's speech to the negative impact of over-exposure to television. While we all welcome the various advances in television, a booklet has been published in the US which advises children on how to use to best effect the time they spend in front of television, which contributes to obesity and so on. Attempts are being made in the US to draw up certain guidelines in that regard. I am not saying that will happen in this country, but there is a tendency now for double income families to place their children in front of the television. I ask the Minister to be aware of that. Perhaps she will, in conjunction with the Minister for Health and Children, try to track down that booklet and see if it could help our own practices.</P>
    <P>The spokesman for my party, Deputy Kenny, inquired about Radio 4. We can access that station in my part of the country. I will have a chat with him afterwards about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I have been following the debate and certain reservations have been expressed, many of which will be teased out on Committee Stage. It is interesting that so many politicians have contributed to this debate because we all know that the oxygen of publicity sustains us as politicians. We have a tremendous respect for not only television but local radio stations. Local radio stations have huge listenerships and have transformed the roles of many politicians in their local areas. The developments in that direction over the years must be appreciated, as must much of the good work the Independent Radio and Television Commission has done in its capacity as watchdog for the local radio stations. I am pleased the Bill is giving extra powers and strengths to the Independent Radio and Television Commission and that its function will be renamed.</P>
      <P>Some time ago a deputation from the private radio stations met many politicians in this House. They were concerned that the television licence income was going exclusively to RTE and they stated that some subvention from that licence should go directly to the radio stations. The Minister is probably going some way in that direction in the Bill because she has indicated that the new Broadcasting Commission will not accept fees in the future from the local radio stations. This should help the financial base of those stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> It would be remiss of me not to congratulate a local young journalist who won a national award recently, Joe Nash, who works for a local radio station in Limerick, 95FM. I wish him well in the future. The local radio stations have given a tremendous boost to the profession of journalism. They have created a lot of job opportunities and many people have progressed successfully within the local radio stations, with some of them moving to local newspapers and so on.</P>
    <P>Those of us with MMDS or cable have access to a variety of channels. The current buzzwords are &ldquo;digital&rdquo;, &ldquo;terrestrial&rdquo; and so on. Given the number of channels we will get in the future, extra vigilance will be required. This is a small country and it is understandable for RTE to look to the future and be concerned about its potential commercial revenue, given the competition which is likely to occur. Will the Minister provide alternative finance for stations such as RTE which will have a public mandate, probably similar to that of the BBC in Britain? It is heartening to be able to watch a film in its entirety on BBC without being interrupted by commercials. However, commercials are needed to sustain the livelihoods of those who work in these radio stations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive direction of the Bill. I also welcome the retention of the complaints commission. It will be important to have a degree of vigilance when there is a dramatic expansion in the number of channels available. For example, the accessibility of pornographic channels would be a matter of concern to people in the wider community. We must have a watchdog to monitor the type of programmes received.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous potential profits in this business. Recently Cablelink was sold for £535 million, which is a staggering amount of money. There must be a certain amount of profitability in the long-term in order for investors to become involved.</P>
    <P>RTE has provided a very good service over the years. In recent times, TG4 has come of age, not necessarily in terms of its contribution to the Irish language, which was its important and dominant role, but in taking the responsibility to broadcast the DIRT hearings by the Committee of Public Accounts. A remarkable number of people told me they watched that with great interest. That did a great deal for the body politic, which has been besmirched to a degree by the tribunals going on outside this House. People could see at first hand the good work which politicians can do within the committee system. We must thank TG4 for helping us in that direction.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, one does a great deal of preparation for Question Time, and even more when one is in Opposition. It is disappointing that Question Time is often not reported on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, or only a very small part of it. We must thank TG4, which broadcasts much of Question Time on an ongoing basis. That has also done a great deal for the credibility of politics because people can appreciate what we are doing here. Many people see empty seats in the <Col N="887" /> Chamber when they look at television and do not understand what politicians actually do in the House. It is desirable that television helps in this regard, particularly TG4 and &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we are debating broadcasting and the future role of television. Many people are concerned about developments in this area and the number of channels which will be available. In this regard we must be extra vigilant concerning the types of channels available. People will not accept some channels, particularly pornography channels, and we would all be concerned if matters progressed in that direction. I am pleased that there are mechanisms and protections in the legislation whereby people can lodge complaints with the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. I am glad the Minister did not dismantle this provision as the broadcasting and complaints commissions will complement each other in the long-term interests of television. I welcome this positive Bill which can be further improved by way of amendments.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not forget that RTE championed television and radio for many years and that it is not left behind. There are those who enter the market with mercenary motives and a long-term profit objective, yet we still depend on a service like RTE which has a public role. That role must be measured and finance provided to ensure RTE continues to provide that service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I am not an expert on broadcasting but the publication of the Bill and this debate gives us an opportunity to discuss broadcasting policy in relatively broad terms, to comment on the national television service, make suggestions on how it can be improved and other such matters.</P>
      <P>Digital broadcasting will change television dramatically. In the 1960s and 1970s people had a limited choice of television viewing, apart from those on the east coast and along the Border who enjoyed British channels. There was much excitement when RTE 2 came into being in the late 1970s and when multi-channel services were made available. Most people now have quite a wide choice of channels and digital television will expand those frontiers even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One sees advertisements for television companies which claim that particular sets can carry 40, 50 or 100 channels. In the future every household will have access to hundreds of channels. That is good, but as Deputy Finucane pointed out, in addition to the opportunities offered, there will be difficulties. The Minister, the Department and television companies have a responsibility to ensure that, where possible, the <Col N="888" /> service is reasonable, fair and balanced and does not provide people, particularly children, with access to undesirable channels and viewing.</P>
    <P>Parents also have a responsibility in this area and we have to recognise that, over the past two decades, television has become an unofficial babysitter. It is undesirable that many children have no recreational alternative to television. They go from their schoolbooks to television to bed to school, and the cycle starts again. The Minister's wider remit gives her responsibility for arts and culture and I wonder about the impact of television on those areas. Children have become experts on every television programme and know the producers as well as the stars. I wonder if the broader disciplines of arts and culture are losing out as a result of too much emphasis on and viewing of television by young people. I do not want to be a killjoy and we cannot turn the clock back, but we have to examine the broader impact of television on younger people. Many studies have highlighted the dangers of too much television on younger people. This issue might also be taken on board by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin. We must give children a broader vision of leisure, recreation and after-school activities as opposed to watching television all evening.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this point, extra choice is good in every aspect of life and I have no difficulty with the advent of digital television. This Bill will provide the legislative framework for the services to be introduced. Will the Minister outline the impact which the legislation and digital television will have on legislation governing MMDS and community channels promised as late as yesterday by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke? There was an important debate on community television for many years and we seemed to make a breakthrough in recent months concerning the mechanism which would allow for such television. Will the Minister outline the impact the legislation and digital television will have on the provision and maintenance of community deflector systems?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Finucane's comments on coverage of Oireachtas proceedings. Some months ago a colleague commented colourfully on the fact that &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; was watched by drunks and insomniacs. However, through its coverage of the DIRT tribunal, TG4 showed people that the Oireachtas has a serious role to play in the life of the country and its citizens. Perhaps RTE could learn from this and broadcast &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; and other important debates more regularly.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the proper establishment of TG4. Many Deputies, myself included, expressed doubts about TnaG's long-term future and relevance when it was set up, but we have been proven wrong. The service is doing very well and is providing a real alternative, and I hope it continues to do so. There is a role for TG4 in selling Irish culture in its broadest terms. The Bill stipulates that the service should cater for the expectations of those whose preferred spoken <Col N="889" /> language is Irish. TG4 should concentrate on Irish culture. Deputy Martin should also reflect on this issue when examining the miserable grades achieved on the Irish paper in this year's leaving certificate. Do we consider Irish as too narrow a subject? Irish and Irishness must include the culture of the country and not just the language. TG4 can play a part in selling not just a language but Irish culture as a whole. Perhaps the legislation will give it extra scope in its remit as there is need for the transmission of programmes on Irish culture as opposed to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak briefly on section 24 which provides for the categories of programmes which shall be included in programme schedules. In particular I wish to speak about a hobby-horse of mine, namely, coverage of horse racing on our national channel. Before anybody tells me horse racing is a minority sport, between 70,000 and 80,000 people each weekend pursue some form of equestrian activity. Coverage of horse racing by RTE has gone from bad to worse to dreadful to appalling to disgraceful. There was a time when 14 or 15 race meetings per annum were covered by RTE. However, that is now down to nine or ten. This is very regrettable when compared and contrasted with the way in which sports such as grand prix racing have been promoted and covered by the national broadcaster in recent years. I have no difficulty with giving good coverage to any sport. I note with huge satisfaction RTE's proper and total support and coverage of Gaelic games, particularly hurling, the image of which has been literally transformed over the past ten years. RTE has a duty to do the same for horse racing, one of our oldest national sports. However, the lack of coverage on RTE radio and television of horse racing on a daily basis is absolutely disgraceful. The Minister may not have total responsibility in this regard, but I note section 24 gives the Minister certain powers to provide for mandatory coverage of some events. I ask the Minister to discuss the possibility of using these powers to ensure one of our greatest national sports, which is not just a past-time but an industry employing tens of thousands of people, generating hundreds of millions of pounds for the country each year and giving our country a very proud and strong name abroad, gets its fair share of coverage by RTE.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable and disgraceful that there is no Saturday sports programme on RTE given that we are a sports mad country. As a consequence horse racing is getting no coverage. I am not sure if the Minister is a fan of horse racing, but many of her colleagues are major supporters of racing and last Saturday the biggest race ever in Northern Ireland was held in Down Royal. It was attended by thousands of people from the Republic, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh. Yet it was necessary to watch Channel 4 if one wanted to see coverage of it as our own national broadcaster deemed it unfit to cover. On Monday evening TV3, the independent <Col N="890" /> channel, carried a report and some coverage of the race, but there was absolutely no coverage on RTE which simply gave, almost reluctantly, the bare result as part of the sports news that night. This is insufficient and I appeal to the Minister to speak to the powers that be in the sports department of RTE as they have lost the word racing from their sporting directory. Ping-pong is probably a more popular sport in the RTE sports department than horse racing. I condemn this practice which gives a disgraceful deal to one of our great national sports and industries and I want to see a reversal of that trend.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill which is obviously part of the process of moving forward. Before we enter with an open cheque book into this bold new world of digital TV, I hope the Minister will reflect on what has been said from the Opposition and Government benches about the need for certain monitoring and controls. Choice is good but one can go overboard. I also hope the Minister will initiate some study to examine on a formal basis the impact of TV on younger children. Without condemning television coverage or dwelling too much on the ill effects, we have to try to put in place alternatives to television as a baby sitting service, something it has become in too many households.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and apologise for straying from the broader aspects of the Bill. I again remind the Minister of my comments on the television coverage of horse racing. It is disgraceful and unforgivable for RTE to give such scant coverage to one of our greatest sports. I hope the Minister can impress on the station the need to revisit its policy in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bradford for sharing time with me and for allowing me make a brief contribution to this very important debate. It is 11 years since we have had a serious discussion on these issues in the House &ndash; at that time we discussed the Radio and Television Act, 1988. It has been 40 years since we discussed the report of the television commission of 1959. There have been substantial changes since those times. Television was practically new in most households at that time &ndash; indeed many households had no television &ndash; while radios were few and far between. With the advent of transistors, radio is available 24 hours a day to practically everybody and young people seem to be plugged in all the time to radio, which is a major source of information and influence on all our lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before discussing the principal concern of the legislation, namely, television, it would be remiss not to refer to the great success of local radio which has had a major influence on the development of local communities in terms of important items of information, news and events. In my area I commend Northern Sound, which has been an outstanding success, on doing marvellous work. In its own way it gave people an opportunity to enter radio journalism, some of whom have gone on to great success further afield. Damien <Col N="891" /> O'Reilly, for example, started out with Northern Sound and has now progressed to the national radio station where he is an agricultural commentator worth listening to. Other people who got their opportunity in local radio and who progressed further come to mind. Though in a way it is sad to be losing good people to the national station, one cannot hold people back and if they can further their career we wish them every success.</P>
    <P>Local radio has had a major influence and has been a great success. It was a battle royal to get local radio established as RTE was not very much in favour of it for fear it would impinge on its work. However, it has helped promote and develop broadcasting and competition is always the life of trade.</P>
    <P>In terms of how things progress, I recall céili dancing on radio. When this was discussed people asked how céili dancing could be broadcast on radio. Dinjo &ndash; with a name like that I presume he came from Cork &ndash; became a household name with his show, &ldquo;Céili House&rdquo;. He made stars of owners and promoters of céili bands. A household name in my county was Eugene Leddy's Céili Band, which was very successful and which was listened to on Saturday nights. Other great céili bands came to life through the idea of having dancing on radio. While people asked how it was possible to have dancing on radio, it was possible to hear the steps and it gave great entertainment. However, things have moved considerably from that time and I do not think young people would listen to such broadcasting today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dancing is still available. Many programmes being broadcast are unsuitable and the Minister has a duty to protect our young people. I am far from a killjoy, but occasionally if I am at home I look at soap operas and wonder about the influence they have on teenagers and people in their formative years. Do these young ones on glossy soap operas ever have to work? How do they earn their livelihood? It seems that they are always either at the seaside or in a bar having a long drink.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not how life is, but young people can be influenced by it. The attitudes of young people are formed by constantly watching such programmes.</P>
      <P>Of course I am in favour of sport and I take the point made very strongly by Deputy Bradford. He is perfectly right that horse racing is one of our national sports of which we should be proud. Some of the finest horses in the world have been produced on stud farms in this country and we should use every opportunity to promote that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that having a television <Col N="892" /> does not necessarily mean one will get the picture. We are now confronted with pay per view television. One already pays a substantial amount for the television licence. The pay per view policy applies to sports channels, such as those run by Sky Television. Young people tune into Sky for important soccer matches, car racing, boxing and so forth but they are obliged to pay substantially more for it. The cigarette, drinks and oil companies are taking over and deciding what the person pays and whether the event is available to the viewer. That is a worrying trend and I am wary of it. I understand Ireland's next soccer match is not available on RTE because it does not have the rights to the match. It is a straightforward match. I do not know who Ireland is playing &ndash; that is the extent of my knowledge about soccer &ndash; but I have heard young people&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;complaining that it is not available on RTE. The match is being played at Lansdowne Road but it cannot be shown to the people. There is something radically wrong there. If this trend is to continue, people will not only have to pay their licence fees but also have a slot machine and pay to view the sport they want to watch.</P>
      <P>What about the promotion of our own games? Somebody said recently that hurling will be the biggest sport on television. There is a huge audience for it. People who have never seen it before cannot get over the skill and the speed with which the game is played. It has become enormously popular. We have an opportunity to promote that game. The same is true of Gaelic football. Our footballers travelled to Australia recently and showed the Australians how to play Australian Rules football. They beat the Australians in their own back garden. We should be proud of that and promote our game. There is an audience for it and for our horse racing. I am not a horse racing fan but I enjoy watching the racing and the surrounding colour and scenery. Horse racing is a good way to promote this country.</P>
      <P>By and large, I commend the Minister. She is doing an excellent job. I also commend the national station which is also doing a good job. We must, however, keep abreast of what is happening in broadcasting and be wary of the pitfalls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief. I listened with interest to the contributions of other Deputies, particularly Deputy Hanafin. She said RTE compared favourably with state broadcasters in Iran. The ayatollahs in RTE will be deeply reassured to hear that. Her basic point, however, is valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cultural values propagated by the television medium are important and have a deep political role. That is best exemplified by what happened in East Germany. We are currently commemorating the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. I recall sitting in a bar in east Berlin before the fall of the Wall listening to East <Col N="893" /> Germans talking about television programmes. They were not talking about East German television programmes but about &ldquo;Kojak&rdquo;, which was broadcast by West German television. At that time, many of the TV aerials in East Germany pointed west so the people could receive western television. That had a huge role.</P>
    <P>I discussed this with some East Germans and they could not get over the fantastic glamour and wealth to be seen in programmes such as &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo;. In the detective programmes they saw car chases in which people regularly crashed cars while the East Germans had to wait ten years for delivery of an old trabant. These programmes gave them the clear impression that the west was the place to be. This was where one could get luxury and cars. The programmes had a profound effect. At some stage somebody will do a thesis on this subject and examine the role played by television in influencing people in the former communist countries.</P>
    <P>There is an assumption throughout this debate that RTE is a public service broadcaster. I dispute that. RTE is a state broadcaster and there is an important distinction, one I will discuss later. The most common definition of public service broadcasting, a definition quoted by my colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins, is the famous maxim of Lord Reith that the purpose of public service broadcasting was to inform, to educate and to entertain. Nobody could take issue with that. We should also remember that it was Lord Reith who expounded the three truths of public service broadcasting &ndash; impartiality, objectivity and balance.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to a book which has just been published by John Pilger called &ldquo;Hidden Agendas&rdquo;. He draws attention to the fact that the BBC World Service was originally called the Empire Service and was funded by the Foreign Office, as the service still is. Its declared role after the Second World War was to preserve and strengthen the Commonwealth and the Empire and &ldquo;increase our trade and investments abroad&rdquo;. So much for impartiality, objectivity and balance.</P>
    <P>There is also an agenda within our State broadcaster. Bob Collins told a media seminar that the essence of balance is fairness. How does one define &ldquo;fairness&ldquo;? Perhaps the Minister can answer that. It is an important question. There is a court case on this issue which has not yet concluded. The question arose during the divorce referendum. I supported a yes vote in that referendum but, as a democrat, I thought it unbelievable that RTE would allow five uncontested broadcasts on behalf of the establishment parties who were calling for a yes vote and not give the same coverage to the no vote. That is not fair. It is beyond me how anybody could say it is.</P>
    <P>We need to examine the way RTE runs its political section. I have long been aware that RTE has a close relationship with the establishment parties, that is, the parties that have been in Government or will be in Government. We <Col N="894" /> appear to operate our Governments on a rotational basis but, as ordinary people have discovered, there is actually&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>One never knows. We do not discount that possibility. The Greens are in government in many countries in Europe. I hope that if we were in Government, we would ensure real democracy in terms of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Take the example of the European elections. Two Green Party MEPs won seats in that election but if one were to listen to the RTE broadcasts, one would think our candidates were going to be eliminated. They repeatedly said the Green Party would not make it or that it was only hanging on for the last seat. The reason for this was simple. I was in the RDS and the political correspondents from RTE were hanging out with the spin doctors from the establishment parties who were spinning them a line. That problem must be examined.</P>
      <P>The new channel, TV3, which is not intended to be a public service broadcaster&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I see. The Deputy is making allegations I would not dare make in the Chamber. It is an issue that must be examined. TV3, for example, broadcasts political programmes but the station does not have the same fear, as it were, of the establishment parties. Therefore, it offers fairer broadcasts about politics. That has been my experience.</P>
      <P>We need to examine the issue of content. The Minister is probably familiar with the words of an old Bruce Springsteen song &ldquo;57 Channels and Nothing On&rdquo;. We may come to have access to thousands of channels with very poor content, but I would be critical of that. As a previous speaker said, this would result in audience fragmentation. In that regard, we need only think back to what has happened in recent years. In the days when RTE was the only station available, &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; was the show. Everyone saw it and it was a medium of discourse, but now viewers have a great choice of channels, including Sky and other channels. People flick through the channels. There is not an audience that tunes into only RTE. RTE's one time audience has dissipated. In some ways that is welcome because we have real regionalisation, local radio stations and in time, with digitalisation I hope, we will have local television stations. They have developed in other countries and work very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider the question of how we broadcast. Noam Chomsky talked about manu<Col N="895" /> facturing consent. He finds it difficult to get onto American television and one person told him he could not go on television because he was inarticulate. He asked the person to explain what he meant by that and was told he would not give viewers a soundbite. To be articulate, apparently one must be good at giving soundbites.</P>
    <P>It is frightening that over the years there has been a dumbing down in the content of the programmes broadcast. Shows like Gerry Springer's are abysmal, but they are the type of programmes that sell. RTE is meant to be a public service broadcaster, but it also seems to be dumbing down. It recruited a few pretty faces to give the weather forecast, although it has made a U-turn on that decision. That is not what public service broadcasting is about. RTE should present detailed weather forecasts. RTE is either a public service broadcaster or it behaves in a commercial way. It seems it cannot make up its mind about that and is trying to cover both areas. I would like the Minister to address these important questions.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be aware of the criticisms other operators here have made about Digico. I draw her attention to criticism of it by Mr. James Morris, Chairman of TV3. He said that Digico will act as the common carrier controlling all terrestrial broadcasting, both analogue and digital, and that it will, therefore, have a monopoly on distribution. He also said that at the same time RTE will be the content provider on the Irish channels while Digico will determine what goes out on the others.  We are dealing with a monopoly, and that needs to be counteracted.</P>
    <P>As the worldwide web develops, mini-television stations, so to speak, will develop. I do not want to be too negative of RTE , but I compliment it on its website, which is outstanding. One can click into its website and watch the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; and it has a fantastic archive. When cable television is developed fully and everyone has an ISDN line, in effect, a website will become a television station. That will take place. Has the Minister examined that area, as that revolution is nearly upon us now? It will happen extremely quickly.</P>
    <P>There are advantages and disadvantages associated with that development. It will enable those who do not have access to television to broadcast. While there is an awful lot of dross on the worldwide web &ndash; Deputies have spoken of the danger of pornographic programmes broadcast on television etc. &ndash; it is difficult to counteract the broadcast of such material. To gain access to it, all one need do is erect a satellite dish.</P>
    <P>One can gain access to many sites on the worldwide web. While one can gain access to information on how to make a bomb or pornographic material, many of the sites are informative. If we could develop these sites, a huge data bank would be available to all those with access to the worldwide web, and that would enhance democracy and the democratic process. Has the Minister <Col N="896" /> considered how this website will develop and impact on people's lives? Has she discussed these possibilities with RTE and the other providers? That area must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Overall, DTT is the way to proceed. While I will table some minor amendments on Committee Stage, I welcome the general direction taken by the Minister and I support her on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a short contribution to this Bill. I compliment the Minister on introducing it. I heard Deputy Kenny many mornings on the Order of Business ask when this legislation would be introduced. The last legislation on broadcasting was introduced in 1988. This is probably the most important legislation that will come before the House for a long time as it will determine what will happen in the area of broadcasting for the coming years. That is one of the reasons Fine Gael is not opposing it. Given that it has taken a long time for it to be introduced, if it was voted down it might take another ten or 11 years before another Bill is introduced. I am sure many amendments will be tabled to it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley referred to the issue of fairness in RTE broadcasts. I want to praise RTE, but before I do that I want to criticise it. I listened to Marian Funucane one morning in the run-up to the June local elections when she interviewed a candidate on her programme for an hour. That did not show balance.</P>
      <P>I remember Deputy Kenny walking me around the town of Castlebar during the campaign in a by-election in June 1994.</P>

      <P>I remember a programme on the then EU Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, which was due to be broadcast and which RTE promoted for two weeks prior to its scheduling &ndash; I did not mind that because he is a Mayo man. RTE was not satisfied to broadcast that programme once but broadcasted it again a week before that by-election. There was no mention of the fellow from Westport, Ring who was standing for Fine Gael&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of that the Fianna Fáil candidate was beaten. Recently, I heard a former Minister, who held the same position now held by the Minister, criticise me on Radio na Gaeltachta in the run-up to elections because I could not speak Irish and did not come from the area. I had not made up my mind whether I would go forward as a candidate and I had to make up my mind about the Údarás elections. He picked a neighbour of mine, who lived a mile from my House and came from Achill originally, to contest the election. I am now learning some Irish from my daughter <Col N="897" /> who is doing her leaving certificate and loves Irish.</P>
      <P>I switched to TG4 last week and watched a film starring John Wayne, but he was not speaking Irish. Last Saturday night I was hoping to watch &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; and I had to switch channels very quickly because it was not &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; that was on TG4&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>TG4 will be competing with Sky television for the type of programmes that are broadcast after 12 p.m.  If it continues to show such programmes, its audience will increase. I had to switch channels quickly that night because my family was with me in the room.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley referred to political programmes and the bias involved, but I am annoyed that RTE has neglected rural Ireland. That is why local radio has taken off. It is not that it is any better than RTE or has better programmes, it has taken off because local radio deals with the day to day problems encountered by people on the ground. RTE forgot about that. The one mistake it made when it had a monopoly was that it did not follow the BBC's example and develop regional television and radio which could be run by the local people but would remain under the control of RTE.</P>
      <P>RTE has broadened our horizons. When something happens in America, Brussels or anywhere else in the world, Charlie Bird and other correspondents travel there so they can report back to us. I hope they do not do this at their own expense, although I am sure they get allowances from RTE. I know they are concerned about our expenses, but we would like to know how much expenses they get and what RTE's presenters are paid.</P>
      <P>We are all broadcasters. As politicians, we broadcast our message to the public in the hope we will be elected at the next general election. The Freedom of Information Act ensures that people know our salaries and expenses and how many times we vote in the House. I do not have a problem with that, but if such information is made available to the public, we should also know the salaries, expenses and bonuses of RTE's producers and presenters. I do not mind if someone gets £2 million a week if they are good at their job and they can attract an audience. However, they always seem to have a problem with what politicians earn.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to give a station a licence to serve only a proportion of the people. Many parts of north Mayo cannot get RTE and many Gaeltacht areas cannot get TG4, which is geared towards the Gaeltacht. I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister on this issue and I was told that TG4 is buying land and getting planning permission. However, it is a long time on the air and it is wrong that Gaeltacht areas cannot access its programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an outcry in my constituency when <Col N="898" /> TV3 was launched because many areas could not get a signal. I know it is a private company but it took on the licence for the State and it should not be allowed to broadcast to certain parts of the country. TV3 has exclusive rights to international football matches, but people in Mayo cannot see them because they cannot get a signal. That should not be allowed to happen. If a company gets a television or radio licence and signs an agreement to cover a specific area but fails to do so, the licence should be revoked until it puts the proper infrastructure in place.</P>
    <P>RTE has been criticised in recent years, but it has done a good job and made some good programmes. I like to watch Irish made programmes, such as &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;, which stars Mick Lally, &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo;. I saw a few excellent films recently which were made and produced in this country. Some were made independently of RTE and some were made with RTE and private investors. Programmes, such as &ldquo;Amongst Women&rdquo;, part of which was filmed in my constituency a few months ago, are excellent. We do not need to depend on the Americans or the British to make good programmes because we can do so ourselves. Support and resources should be provided to help people to make good programmes and films. There is nothing wrong with being biased towards our national station.</P>
    <P>I am worried about what will happen in the future in terms of Sky television. Does Sky television pay the Government money to allow it to beam its programmes into the country? Everyone else has to get a licence to broadcast and they also pay taxes. Does Sky pay taxes or viewing rights to the State? </P>
    <P>Everything is changing with the advent of computers and multi-channel television. People, particularly those who are not used to such systems and who have not been trained, are frightened by such a big change. They are used to RTE One and Network 2, but they are worried about what will happen in the future. I hope RTE and the State's investment will be protected because it is important that the State has control over what is heard on our national airwaves. We do not have much control over what is beamed into people's homes on Sky late at night. Children use the excuse they want this station because of its football coverage or its educational or wildlife programmes. However, we should not allow such programmes to be beamed into our homes without some form of control.</P>
    <P>I was in America recently where there are approximately 100 channels, but there is nothing good on any of them. If there is a chat show on one channel, there will be a chat show on six other channels as they compete with each other. The same applies for the primary elections.</P>

      <P>When he got his pension, he was upset if the exchange rate of the dollar disimproved. I always knew if the rate was good or bad because that determined his mood.</P>
      <P>We have a proper broadcasting structure in place. RTE One, Network 2, TV3 and TG4 offer good competition. It would be wrong to allow American or British influences, such as Rupert Murdoch, to get control of the airwaves because they could then decide what propaganda and sporting events should be broadcast. People would have to pay and the Exchequer would get nothing out of it. We should not be afraid to be biased towards RTE and State agencies.</P>
      <P>I am worried that some stations, such as TV3, could take the Government to court because it is unconstitutional to use television licence fees to fund one television station. This means other stations cannot compete on a level playing field. We should consider distributing the money collected from such licences to local radio and television, which will be introduced in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the MMDS issue in the west. This arose because the major cities had BBC 1, BBC 2, UTV and Channel 4 while people in the west had to beam the signal illegally into their homes as the State would not do it for them, although people would have paid for it. That created a major political storm. The problem was not that RTE was not doing its job but that the State gave licences to groups which did not comply with the licensing laws. I hope the Minister deals with this issue in the Bill. A licence should cover the entire country and that would prevent a similar problem arising in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister is considering legalising MMDS companies. I do not know what will happen when digital television is introduced because technology is developing extremely fast. My family got our first television set on the day President Kennedy was asassinated. I remember where I was when I heard of the assassination because I associate it with getting our first television set. My grandfather bought the television for us because the dollar was doing well at the time. We were looking forward to seeing an episode of &ldquo;Katy the Farmer's Daughter&rdquo;&ndash; I am sure the Minister is too young to remember it &ndash; and we were very disappointed when normal programmes were cancelled because of the assassination. We were lucky to have a television because not many of our neighbours had one and they used to come to our house to watch sports broadcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not forget our national culture. I used very much to enjoy a programme called &ldquo;One Man and his Dog&rdquo;. This was a simple little programme which I used to love to watch on Sunday <Col N="900" /> evening and it could well be copied by RTE. We do not need violent films from abroad. I do not like to see children watching soap operas first thing in the morning, at dinner time and again in the evening. I see this in my own home where my children like to watch &ldquo;Neighbours&rdquo;, &ldquo;Home and Away&rdquo; and other silly programmes from America and elsewhere. Our own programmes, such as &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; are every bit as good. If we give programme makers the necessary money and resources they will do as well as anyone in any part of the world. We saw the success of &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo; which won Oscars and we should not be ashamed to support our own culture and our own programmes. I know people who are afraid to say they watch &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; because it is not grand enough. They are happy to say they watch &ldquo;Home and Away&rdquo; or &ldquo;Neighbours&rdquo;. Does &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; not depict what is happening in Ireland today? It is what we know, understand and enjoy and the same is true of &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo;. These are wonderful programmes and they cannot be beaten. However, people like to watch English programmes such as &ldquo;Brookside&rdquo; because they want to be considered cultured and nice. Our own programmes are just as good and they should be supported.</P>
    <P>My only criticism of RTE is that the station forgot about rural Ireland. RTE managament thought everything started and finished in Dublin and that everything had to be in Dublin. Everything did start in Dublin and now Dublin has every conceivable problem and they are trying to divert these problems to rural Ireland. We will not mind getting some of Dublin's infrastructure and we are prepared to take some of its problems but we want fair play and I hope this can be resolved in the Bill. I hope we will never again see people who are given licences for radio or anything else failing to honour the agreements into which they have entered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity it provides to say a few words on broadcasting in general. We are told that &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; is politically balanced. Only last week an independent Deputy, a Labour Party Deputy and four Fine Gael Deputies, including myself, spoke in a debate. That evening's edition of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; featured the independent Deputy, the Labour Party Deputy and one Fine Gael Deputy. This is called balance. Time on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; should be divided among Members and not simply on a party basis. I am not particularly anxious to appear on the programme but it is in every party's interest to allocate time in this way. People interpret balance differently. I disagree with the system of Opposition parties appointing front bench spokespeople. Ministers and Ministers of State must hold office but every other Member should be treated equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local radio has had a major influence on rural life in recent years and must rate highly among the services provided to our citizens. It provides a service to local sport, gives helpful local infor<Col N="901" /> mation and is useful in many other ways. Everything in this Bill should support the continuation of local radio. Many local stations are now faced with extra costs and I know the Minister has provided £500,000 for local radio but this is not sufficient funding because the maintenance of local radio is very costly.</P>
    <P>Local radio stations face the added problem of uncertainty about the renewal of their licences. Every Minister pays attention to RTE which is our national station. RTE is supported by the licence fee but this is not true of local radio stations. These stations have provided a marvellous service and have gained a local market which RTE could have availed of had it chosen to do so. Perhaps RTE could not do so because the station faced problems of its own. Local radio should be given every help possible.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Bradford, has spoken about horse racing. The other evening the main RTE news bulletin &ndash; and not the sports bulletin &ndash; gave the results of the English Premiership soccer matches but we were not told what won the 5 o'clock in Fairyhouse. The explanation for this may be that more people are interested in English soccer than in what won the 5 o'clock in Fairyhouse but it is RTE's job to present Irish news and happenings in this country. I do not understand why English Premiership soccer is so important. It also seems to be a news item if a pop group comes to town. To most people this is not important news and is a promotion more than anything else. This is something that RTE should be asked to look at.</P>
    <P>A great amount of foreign material is being shown on RTE. I agree with what Deputies have said about violence in programmes. It is sad to see this being churned out on national television programmes. RTE should be asked to look at this. It should not broadcast a barrage of violence and crime, which seems to be the diet served up to people. There must be other programmes available. For example, although I do not know how much they would cost, there are fantastic documentaries about wildlife, etc., but RTE does not seem able to get such programmes. RTE might say that people do not want to watch them and they would sooner watch &ldquo;LA Law&rdquo; or some such programme but if documentaries were presented, people might want to watch them. The chances are that people do want to watch such programmes instead of the noise, violence, blood, gore, etc., which is what is being churned out on the national air waves. I feel strongly about this. The Minister and the RTE authority should consider the type of television programmes which are being broadcast.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of concern among members of the Association of Independent Radio Stations about this Bill. The Minister has had some consultations with them and perhaps she will have more, but I ask her to give every consideration to ensure the future of local radio stations, which have become part and parcel of Irish life. They must go out into the market place <Col N="902" /> to raise their own funding in order to survive. I ask the Minister to give whatever assistance she can in the context of this Bill to ensure their future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate on the Bill which deals with a wide range of broadcasting issues and contains many provisions which are technical in nature. Despite this, it is clear from all contributions that there is a strong appreciation of the importance of the issues being addressed in the Bill. I look forward to dealing with the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny in his contribution to the debate expressed some dismay with regard to the timing associated with the consultation paper issued by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation on the licensing of digital terrestrial television. The consultation process employed by the ODTR is, of course, a matter entirely for that office. However, in order for digital terrestrial television to be established successfully at the earliest date, there must be some certainty as to the licensing regime which prospective investors in the designated company will face. Accordingly, I welcome the fact that the ODTR has entered into this process.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Kenny's general comments, I have to say that I disagree fundamentally with his philosophy. Indeed, while he considers my Bill to be badly thought out, I found his views to be contradictory, particularly in relation to RTE. I do not accept his views on the regulatory regime for digital development. I have said that I must balance technological and economic considerations with the social and democratic concerns. The EU agrees also that it is not appropriate at this stage to try to impose a common regulatory regime for telecommunications and broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Turning to the establishment of the DTT company, the Government set up an inter-departmental project management group to oversee the implementation of the Government's decision to establish a new commercial entity with responsibility for providing terrestrial transmission and technical facilities to broadcasters in the future. The project management group is assisted in this task by a team of consultants who will advise, among other things, on the manner in which the transaction to establish the new entity will be structured. I can assure the Deputy that the intention is that the process and the structure of the final transaction will be conducted in an open and transparent manner which will conform with all national and EU laws and regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny seemed confused about the provisions of the Bill in relation to the regulation of the transmission platforms and the regulation of broadcasting services, which may be distributed on those platforms. The Bill, however, is clear in this regard. There will be two main elements to <Col N="903" /> DTT company's activities: the transmission function and the retail business. The transmission element of the business will be regulated in accordance with the licensing terms and conditions, which will be determined by the ODTR and published by that office following the completion of its consultation process. I assume that the terms and conditions will embrace the question of equitable access at reasonable cost. The transmission entity will not be free to exploit its monopoly position in the market place.</P>
    <P>The retail element of the DTT company relates to the broadcasting services which that company undertakes to provide to its customers on the DTT transmission system. The broadcasting services provided by DTT or any of the other platforms will be subject to EU or Irish regulation as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland under the Bill will be to ensure that all indigenous services which are not free-to-air services of existing broadcasters comply with minimum standards with regard to taste and decency in programme content and standards in relation to advertising or other commercial sponsorship. The supplier of such services will also be subject to the terms and conditions of the appropriate programme content contract entered into with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting services originating outside the State are regarded under the Television Without Frontiers Directive as &ldquo;excepted persons&rdquo; and accordingly such broadcasts cannot be regulated or blocked by the Irish authorities except where it can be shown that programme material might seriously impair the physical, mental and moral development of minors.</P>
    <P>A number of issues raised by Deputy Kenny are outside my area of responsibility and I am sure that my ministerial colleagues and the appropriate regulatory authority will note the Deputy's comments.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea raised many interesting points. I identify myself fully with his concern that we must avoid the risk of creating a two-tier society of information rich and information poor. The philosophy behind my Bill is exactly to ensure that the legislative structures are put in place to create an information society that is affordable by everybody and accessible everywhere in so far as this is practicable.</P>
    <P>On the take up of digital technology, I cannot gaze into the crystal ball and make predictions in this regard. I do not know which platform will be successful or how many of Irish television viewers will take up digital technology in the short-term. I have a sense that people are wary of new technologies because the technology is changing and becoming obsolete so quickly. However, I believe that digital television, on whichever distribution platform, will prove attractive to the Irish public as more digital services become available.</P>
    <P>The BBC document referred to by Deputy O'Shea continues to be relevant to the concept of <Col N="904" /> public service broadcasting and I do not think that anything in the Bill undermines the philosophy embodied in the principles set out in the document.</P>
    <P>I note what the Deputy said in relation to programming for the deaf or hard of hearing and the blind or partially sighted. The Bill envisages that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will make rules requiring broadcasters to take specific steps to promote the understanding and enjoyment of people with such disabilities. This does not rule out the possibility of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland setting targets in relation to subtitling or the proportion of programming which should be dedicated to providing specific services for these groups.</P>
    <P>Turning to Deputy O'Shea's comments on the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge or TG4 and its future role, the Government made a commitment to set up Teilifís na Gaeilge on a statutory basis and the Bill follows through on this commitment by providing for its establishment and defining the nature of service which it is obliged to fulfil. The Bill does not change the ethos of TG4 and I would like to take this opportunity to again offer congratulations to the comhairle, management and staff of Teilifís na Gaeilge for their achievements over the past three years. With regard to the formal establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge, I will discuss the matter with RTE, Comhairle Theilifís na Gaeilge and the management of the service in relation to the optimum time to make this move.</P>
    <P>On the subject of Digico, I refer to my comments on Deputy Kenny's contribution. The approach taken is in line with RTE's suggestion for the development of digital television in Ireland. Deputy O'Shea raised a number of other issues in relation to Digico which cannot be addressed at this time because the work of the project management group and the consultants involved is not sufficiently advanced to the stage where answers are available.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea also queried the future relationship between RTE and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. I wish to make clear that the Bill does not seek to infringe in any way on the editorial independence of RTE. However, as stated earlier, I have already sought to ensure that all indigenous broadcasting services will adhere to common standards in relation to taste and decency in programming and standards relating to advertising and other commercial sponsorship.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Flynn for his support for the Bill. During his contribution he referred to the provision relating to the capital fund of £500,000 for local radio services. It will be a matter for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to draw up the criteria that will apply to the allocation of grants from this fund to local stations. I understand that the existing Independent Radio and Television Commission has already done considerable work in drawing up the scheme and I expect it will come into operation as soon as poss<Col N="905" /> ible after the enactment of the legislation. I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy's praise for the achievements of the local radio sector over the past ten years. However. the question of issuing renewal contracts to existing contractors is a matter solely for the Independent Radio and Television Commission and not for the Minister concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's reference to TG4, I assure him that the provision relating to the obligation on it to have &ldquo;an awareness of the need for understanding and peace within the island of Ireland&rdquo; is not solely applicable to TG4. Similar obligations have been on the Statute Book in relation to RTE since 1976 and the independent sector since 1988. It is appropriate that this provision should be restated in respect of the new television service, TG4.</P>

      <P>It is not available at present but I will distribute it to Deputies later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donal Carey suggested that the Bill should be more radical but he made no suggestions in this regard. It is precisely because technological development is moving so fast that it is not wise to try to devise an elaborate statutory regime in this area.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that the last major Bill on broadcasting was enacted in 1988 &ndash; the one before that was enacted in 1976. Against this background, it is correct to provide in legislation an umbrella that is sufficiently wide to cater for as many eventualities as possible so that the innovation, enterprise and imagination of Irish people will not be inhibited by lack of legislative authority. The new Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will be expected to exploit the flexibility offered by the Bill to the benefit of Irish broadcasting and Irish enterprise. The Deputy seems to think that a cold item of legislation should be a replacement for the living imagination of our people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey also referred to the independent television production sector. The establishment of TG4 has created a new, young, vibrant independent television production sector along the western seaboard and in the Gaeltachtaí. There has been much discussion about the amount of money to be allocated to the independent sector by RTE. I dealt with this extensively in the course of my opening contribution on Second Stage. Given the dispute that existed between RTE and the independent sector regarding what was basically an interpretation of law, I could not intervene. The Committee Stage amendment I intend to bring before the House will be acceptable to both the independent sector and RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Conor Lenihan's constructive comments on the Bill, although we will have to agree to differ on some points. During his contribution the Deputy expressed concerns that the various transmission platforms would not operate <Col N="906" /> on a level playing field. I assure him that the intention is that all distribution networks will be subject to technical regulation by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. The powers of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will relate solely to programme content.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Lenihan's proposition that Irish broadcasting is now based on three pillars of broadcasting services, namely, the public, commercial and community sectors, but I must state that I regard the totality of RTE's existing services, including Network 2 and 2FM, as essential elements of its public service remit.</P>
    <P>Community radio stations are an important feature in the landscape of Irish broadcasting. The Independent Radio and Television Commission, in its policy document on community radio broadcasting, has committed itself to continue to define it as a distinct strand in Irish broadcasting. Such commitment is reflected in its active encouragement of the sector through, among other things, the community radio support scheme. Regardless of how community stations are licensed at present, the State's commitment to the community radio sector has never been stronger.</P>
    <P>With regard to the introduction of a statutory definition of community radio, I do not believe it is appropriate to deal with this matter at this time. In addition and in the context of the changing broadcasting environment, it is felt that it is better to allow both the sector and the Independent Radio and Television Commission to have maximum freedom to develop the area.</P>
    <P>While the Broadcasting Bill refers to community channels, it does so only in the context of cable and MMDS systems which are licensed to distribute broadcasting services in a specific geographic location. The use of the term &ldquo;community&rdquo; in this context has no implications for the community radio sector with regard to the provision of services to a community of interest and does not reflect any wish to limit the potential of that sector.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Lenihan, I intend that this Bill will facilitate diversity in the future. One can visualise many types of service of a public nature such as education, access to information services and other electronic services. None of this is prevented from developing under the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the subject of reciprocity of coverage between North and South, the object is that if radio frequency planning in the North can be adapted to accommodate the transmission of digital services originating from here, reciprocal arrangements may be entered into.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford made a plea that some of the licence fee should be diverted to local radio stations. I do not favour breaking the present arrangement whereby RTE receives the total net receipts from licence fees. I remind the Deputy that the Bill will abolish the 3 per cent levy payable by the local radio sector. In addition, the Bill provides for the establishment of a capital fund of £500,000 specifically for the local radio sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> I welcome Deputy McGuinness's support for the Bill. His vision of the possible future world of television coincides in large measure with mine. The Bill seeks to create the space in the new international digital era for the indigenous services he wishes to see developed. Deputy McGuinness's idealism is tempered with a healthy dose of realism. &ldquo;Ireland incorporated&rdquo; does not have the resources to match those of the new global multi-media conglomerates. However, we have the spirit, imagination, stories and talent to ensure that Irish people will produce the Irish programming that is demanded by and relevant to the cultural needs of our citizens. The proposals in the Bill facilitate this.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, I share the Deputy's concerns with regard to the risk of creating a two-tier information society. I am confident that the appropriate Government machinery is being brought to bear to seek to ensure that all our citizens have an acceptable level of access to the new technologies and are also facilitated in its use.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Sargent's broad support for my proposals. In his contribution he referred to what he calls &ldquo;the privatisation of RTE's transmission system&rdquo;. I assure the Deputy that one of the core objectives of the new digital system will be the provision of a universal service within a very short timeframe. This universal coverage requirement will, I expect, be set down in the licence to be issued by the ODTR.</P>
    <P>With regard to the expertise of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, I agree with the Deputy that the existing Independent Radio and Television Commission is not equipped to take on the new functions identified in the Bill. However, the Independent Radio and Television Commission has been preparing its proposals on the additional resources and expertise it will require to carry out its increased statutory functions.</P>
    <P>There are a number of aspects to the problem of the availability of TG4's transmissions. I understand that TG4 is available from all RTE transmitter and transposer sites and that it is now embarking on the provision of the service from the many self-help schemes that have been established around the country with RTE assistance. This matter was raised by a number of Deputies from the west, particularly Deputy Ring. The issue of the availability of TG4 on cable systems and the difficulty viewers have in finding the station on such systems is a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent and Deputy Crawford referred to the problems surrounding United Christian Broadcasting. I have no function in the selection or otherwise of particular sound broadcasting proposals. The process is entirely in the hands of the Independent Radio and Television Commission which must operate within the legislative provisions set out in the Radio and Television Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> I thank Deputy Pat Carey for his support. I too am concerned about the quality of programme material in the digital era. The Deputy rightly points to the importance of the role of RTE and TG4, as our national public service broadcasters, in maintaining the high quality of programming we have enjoyed to date. The provisions of the Bill will ensure that RTE and TG4 can continue to deliver, in the face of increased competition, quality programming of relevance to the Irish viewer.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Michael Higgins's contribution, I have addressed many of the issues raised by him in my earlier comments. However, I would like to address a number of specific areas. The Deputy referred to a commitment I am supposed to have made in relation to cross-ownership of the media. My contribution on Second Stage of Deputy Michael Higgins's Broadcasting and Other Media Bill, 1998, made it clear that I do not have functional responsibility for matters relating to the Competition Act, 1991. I did, however, inform the House that the competition and mergers review group was examining the issue and that the Tánaiste had undertaken to forward Deputy Micheal Higgins's Bill to the group for its consideration.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is correct in recognising that one of the issues to be faced in the broadcasting sector is the rapid growth in technology and the effect this will have on policy. Deputy Michael Higgins and a number of other Deputies also referred to the phenomenon of convergence. Convergence between broadcasting, communications and information technologies means that the methods of delivery of these services, or the platforms on which such services are delivered, are becoming indistinguishable from one another. It does not necessarily follow that the services themselves will converge, at least in the short-term. This is why the Bill establishes a separate statutory structure for the regulation of broadcasting services. The Bill does not provide for a position where broadcasting should simply be regarded as another commercial telecommunications service and regulated accordingly. Neither does the Bill propose to regulate activity on the Internet. Multi-media activity is not subject to broadcasting regulation at present and I have heard no convincing argument that it should be so now.</P>
    <P>There is an argument that the regulation of the various platforms on which these services can be delivered should be standardised to a large extent. This type of regulation is quite properly the function of the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. Some Deputies expressed concern at the consultation paper on digital broadcast licences issued by the director. I do not share this concern. The director is already responsible for the issue of licences in respect of broadcast transmitters operated by RTE and the independent sector. She already regulates the cable, MMDS and telecommunications sector. The Bill makes it clear that the regulation of the <Col N="909" /> operational aspects of the platform will be a matter for the ODTR. This approach is consistent with the realities of the convergence of technologies without abandoning the important differences in services.</P>
    <P>Despite the concern expressed by a number of Deputies &ndash; I am referring particularly to statements by Deputy Kenny and Deputy Pat Carey &ndash; in regard to the licence fee that RTE will be bankrupt in three years, I would like to make it clear that RTE has not sought a licence fee increase during my time in office and, accordingly, such an increase is not under consideration at this time.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Browne,<i> Carlow-Kilkenny,</i> spoke with such high praise for the quality of all our broadcasting services, national and local, television and radio, and I fully concur with what he said in this regard. I also welcome the Deputy's support for the proposals in the Bill on the abolition of the 3 per cent levy payable by the independent sector to the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the establishment of the capital fund of £500,000 for the local radio sector.</P>

      <P>I will come to that later in my speech. I welcome Deputy Collins's support for the Bill and I am glad he echoed my view, often stated, that broadcasters in the public service ethos and in the commercial sector can co-exist and benefit from each other's existence. In this regard let me use this opportunity to congratulate TV3 on its progress to date in establishing itself with Irish audiences. I appreciate there are certain difficulties associated with the reception of TV3 on cable and MMDS systems. The resolution of these problems is a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and I hope, in the interests of Irish television viewers, these problems can be resolved amicably and speedily.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins referred to the provisions in relation to the use of the independent television production sector by RTE. Significant progress has been made in recent years in the commissioning of high quality programmes by the RTE independent production unit from the independent sector. I am confident that the amendment I will bring forward on Committee Stage will build substantially on what has been achieved.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with many of the issues raised by Deputy Moloney. I welcome his supportive comments on TG4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of additional cost to viewers of the arrival of digital television. In order to receive digital terrestrial television, viewers will either have to purchase a digital television receiver or obtain a set-top box to attach to their analogue receiver. How the set-top box will be provided and the cost involved <Col N="910" /> will be determined by the marketplace. However, let me assure the House that viewers who do not choose to equip themselves with digital technology will continue to receive existing services originating in this country in analogue format for a considerable period into the future. I do not agree with some of the comments made by Opposition Deputies on the switch over period.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ulick Burke suggests that I have been responsible for broadcasting policy for the past ten years. I have only been in office for a little over two years and in that time I have brought forward the most comprehensive broadcasting legislation in over 20 years. I do not accept his views on the position of RTE in the new broadcasting era. The structures I propose to put in place allow all who wish to avail of the new technology to provide new services of all kinds on an equal basis.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the logic of the Deputy's argument in relation to the role of the licence fee in the funding of the public service broadcaster. Is he suggesting that such a range and quality of programming could be provided otherwise? I am satisfied the definition in the Bill is comprehensive in relation to what a broadcaster in the public service should be required to do. I assure the Deputy that it is my objective to ensure that TG4 is adequately funded to enable it to carry out its remit as proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to clarify for the Deputy the question of who will appoint the new Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. No change is proposed. The Government appoints the Independent Radio and Television Commission under the Radio and Television Act, 1988. The membership of the proposed Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will continue to be appointed by the Government.</P>
      <P>Turning to Deputy Ó Caoláin's contribution to the debate, I dealt with the establishment of Digico earlier and in my Second Stage speech and l do not intend to go over that ground again. The Deputy referred to the perceived fall in programming standards in recent years with the explosion in the number of commercially driven television programme services. It is precisely because of this development that strong public service broadcasting is needed. The Bill seeks to ensure that this will happen in the future. I am happy that Irish viewers wish to see on their screens such services rooted in the interests and concerns of Irish citizens and which articulate and contextualise those concerns in the interests of a vibrant democratic process.</P>
      <P>I dealt earlier with the progress that has been made in increasing the coverage of RTE, Network 2, TG4 and TV3 in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must clarify the position of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission will not be under the jurisdiction of the Broadcasting Commission of <Col N="911" /> Ireland. While the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will provide the resources to enable the Broadcasting Complaints Commission to carry out its functions, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission will be totally independent of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Rabbitte's concerns about the impact of the availability of an increasing number of programme services on quality, but l am not as pessimistic about the future as he is. We have a highly educated, articulate population which will demand programming of the highest quality from our indigenous broadcasters.</P>
    <P>To ensure that there is universal availability of digital services, we must establish the digital terrestrial transmission infrastructure. It is the only system that can be rolled out for such coverage quickly. Cable systems, for example, do not offer the possibility of universal coverage for many reasons, not least economic reasons. I dealt with Digico earlier and I welcome the Deputy's support for my efforts to strengthen the position of public service broadcasting in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin, in her portrayal of the broadcasting services that can be found elsewhere, made the most cogent argument in support of a strong public service broadcasting sector. I welcome her full support for the philosophy behind the provisions in the Bill. We cannot stop the reception of programme services originating in other EU member states once they conform with the provisions of the EU directive on transfrontier broadcasts. However, I am confident that indigenous broadcasting services will cater for the needs and tastes of Irish viewers.</P>
    <P>Access to external services of high quality must add to our understanding of other cultures and broaden our horizons. I am sure that the RTE authority will take note of the Deputy's comments regarding programmes it provides. The type and quality of programming which is broadcast was raised by a number of Deputies. However, they will appreciate that this is a matter solely for the authority, not the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the issue of the closedown of the analogue transmission system. The question of when analogue transmissions will be terminated will be a matter for consideration by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation in the first place and, no doubt, by Government at the appropriate time. In this regard does the Deputy seriously suggest that every household in the State with a television set should be arbitrarily deprived of television service through an early closedown of the analogue system in order to facilitate the promotion of digital services that will be largely commercially driven? While I do not have the precise details to hand of the UK's plans in this regard, the Deputy has not fully reflected on the UK position.</P>
    <P>As far as I can recollect, the final decisions on the closedown date will be taken in light of the penetration of receivers capable of digital reception. Any decision on when analogue trans<Col N="912" /> missions will be closed down must take account of the take up of digital services by television viewers. A closedown date could be announced when, for example, a significant penetration of digital receivers or set top boxes, such as 50 per cent of television households, has occurred. At this stage the analogue system will not be shut down before 2015 unless there is an extraordinarily rapid take up of digital in the meantime. I hope that answers Deputy Kenny and others.</P>

      <P>One never knows as politics is a strange business. The process of establishing the digital entity is proceeding concurrently with the passage of the legislation. Of course, the entity cannot be established until the Bill is enacted. In this regard I understand from RTE that a date of September 2000 for the launch of DTT in Ireland is not achievable, but this does not adversely affect the commercial attractiveness of the entity to be created. I dealt earlier with Digico and I do not intend to comment further on the matter. I have also dealt with most of the other issues raised by Deputy Deenihan.</P>
      <P>Like many other speakers, Deputy Perry has rightly given high praise to the achievements of the local radio sector over the past ten years. I am confident the new Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will continue to foster local and community radio services. The Government recognises the achievements of the sector through the provisions of the Bill relating to the capital fund for the sector and the abolition of the levy payable to the Independent Radio and Television Commission. The Deputy referred to RTE's participation in the new digital entity and said that it is getting a very good deal. The process is intended to be fair to RTE and to establish a fair value for the transmission assets to be transferred. It cannot convey any special advantage to either RTE or the new entity and will be conducted fully in accordance with national and EU competition and State aid regulations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of RTE reception in north Sligo. As I have explained in the House many times, I have no statutory function in this matter. However, in accordance with long-standing custom, I am prepared to inform the House about particular cases as notified to me by RTE. I will be happy to make inquiries on the matter on behalf of the Deputy and will communicate with him separately when I receive the information from RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Callely, with other Deputies, highlighted the breadth and range of programming services that are available to the people, which have been produced by Irish people, and I welcome his support for the Bill. I note his concern about the maintenance of standards regarding taste and decency in programming. The BCI will decide how it will go about drawing up the codes of standards for which it will have statutory <Col N="913" /> responsibility under the proposed legislation. Public consultation is not excluded under the Bill and the commission will be free to take this route if it considers that it will enhance the process.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised issues of detail in regard to the provisions of the Bill as they affect the cable and MMDS sectors, particularly in the provision of local and community programme services. It is more appropriate to deal with these issues on Committee Stage and I am sure a number of proposals and amendments will be tabled for consideration. I have received representations from the cable and MMDS industry and I met a deputation last week. I am still considering these representations.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Cosgrave for his positive approach and I concur to a large degree with his philosophy and that of Deputy Timmins. I welcome their support for the proposals which will create the space in the digital era to allow existing national public and private television broadcasters to exploit the new technology. I expect these broadcasters to avail of the opportunity afforded them to develop additional free to air services as well as more specialist services for which a subscription will be payable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins referred to the licence fee. The Bill adequately addresses legitimate concerns that people may have in this regard. Deputy Finucane broadly supported the legislation, for which I thank him. He made complimentary remarks about RTE and TG4. I am glad the Deputy recognised the importance of TG4's transmission of committee proceedings in the Houses. It furthers democratises what goes on here and provides the public with more access to the proceedings of the Houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford, like other Deputies, referred to the need to protect younger viewers from unsuitable programming. This issue has been raised time and again. However, programming does not come directly under my remit. For example, the RTE authority deals with this issue in regard to RTE. I recognise that the Deputy has a specific interest in sports, not least racing. He was concerned that there is not enough coverage of sporting events. He made his views known succinctly. Hopefully somebody on the RTE authority or from RTE itself might take up that debate with him and Deputy Boylan, who also commented on the need for further recognition of racing and other sports.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Bill, 1999, has completed its passage through both Houses and will be signed by the President soon. The legislation will deal with what the public considers to be important cultural and sporting events. We are all aware of the difficulties posed with regard to pay per view. It is because of the onset of pay per view, particularly in relation to sporting events, that this legislation is needed. I thank Members for their support for the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Bradford's contribution, I wish to clarify the position in relation to <Col N="914" /> section 24 of the Bill. This section relates to the public service character of RTE's national broadcasting service and contains no power to intervene in the day to day programming. This goes back to the RTE authority, appointed by Government, which has to satisfy itself that the service provided accords with the guidelines laid down in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have referred to some of the points raised by Deputy Boylan. Certainly &ndash; this is very much an aside &ndash; as someone who had the opportunity to train in the area of psychology, I would be interested in definitive studies, if any, on the effect of television on children or young people. If anyone has that information to hand I would be interested to read it for my own education. It is a debate that interests everyone, particularly parents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley made a strong criticism of RTE in regard to the requirement to be objective and impartial. We will always have this debate, which is a healthy one, between broadcasters and politicians. If everyone considers it is unfair, there must be some sense of balance or fairness. I do not say that with any great levity. It arises a great deal of the time where politicians, as individuals or as members of parties, consider they do not get as fair a deal as they would wish in terms of coverage. The Deputy made a strange remark when he referred to the parties in the House which had at one stage been parties in Government. I think that was his definition of an established party. Yet he referred to established parties in a rather derogatory manner. It must be the first time I have ever heard a public representative or a TD doing his best not to be in a position to be a member of Government. Perhaps he will explain that to me at a later date. However, he has been positive about some of the proposals put forward in the Bill and I thank him for his support.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring raised the issue of TV4 reception. I referred to that in my reply, but if the Deputy wishes to raise any specific issues in his constituency and contacts my office we will try to get the information for him. The Deputy's remarks regarding TV3 should be addressed to the Independent Radio and Television Commission. I have no function in relation to the contractual relationships between TV3 and the Independent Radio and Television Commission. On the subject of control over programmes coming in from abroad, I dealt in detail with that matter earlier. While the Deputy's remarks about the deflector system are interesting, responsibility rests with the ODTR, not with my Department.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in great part with all the issues raised by Deputy Belton in relation to local radio. That issue was raised time and again during the debate. Practically every contributor mentioned the importance of local radio and took the opportunity to recognise the work those stations are doing in mirroring their local communities. I join with them and put in my plug for Clare FM.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce this Bill and I welcome Deputy Connaughton, the Opposition spokesman on agriculture, food and rural development, and other Members to this important debate. This is a crucially important Bill. Its purpose is to streamline and strengthen existing controls. It is directed at reassuring consumers regarding the safety of Irish beef. It will also strengthen the commercial trading infrastructure for the beef sector as a whole. It is landmark legislation. I was pleased to introduce this important Bill in the Seanad so that there would be adequate time during the course of the summer for public debate on it. I would welcome any <Col N="916" /> proposed amendments to strengthen the Bill. Everybody is aware we have a fine food industry which has a good reputation in the production of quality food, but we must copperfasten that with legislation. It is important for consumers worldwide that there is no weak link in the food production chain. The production of safe food is non-negotiable and those who consume Irish food must have confidence in that assurance.</P>
    <P>Beef is a multi-million pound industry which makes a substantial contribution to the Irish economy. In 1998 output from primary beef production, excluding direct payments, amounted to £1.1 billion or about 2 per cent of GNP. There are approximately 130,000 farmers engaged in beef production in Ireland and beef is the major enterprise in some 90,000 of these holdings. In addition, some 10,000 persons are employed in the processing sector and in associated industries at livestock marts, the butchering trade, the retail trade and ancillary industries. By any standard, it is a cornerstone of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The maintenance and development of a strong, vibrant beef industry has been a matter of concern for all Governments in the past. In the beginning of 1996, the Irish beef industry was in a strong international position. Irish beef was commanding prices close to 90 per cent of the EU price through the establishment of a strong presence on the higher end of the European markets and reduced reliance on the lower end of opportunistic markets. Confidence in the industry was high. The advent of the BSE crisis in March 1996 changed all that.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and voice my support for the Labour Party amendment which is timely and a balanced contribution to the current economic and social debate at this critical time in the history of the State. The Labour Party's tax reform policy unashamedly focuses on targeting tax reductions at low and middle income earners. The proposed national minimum wage should be increased to £5 per hour and this level of earnings should be exempt from tax for all workers. The debate on tax reform should concentrate not on cutting tax rates but on increasing the standard rate band to ensure more workers pay tax at a lower rate.</P>
      <P>We cannot talk about tax reform in isolation, especially from public expenditure. The recent MRBI-<i>The Irish Times</i> survey demonstrates that the public is deeply concerned about the level of expenditure on critical social services. It is not clamouring to get a few extra bob in its back pocket when it is well aware that significant investment is required in our schools, health services, services for people with disabilities and legal aid system. When asked whether tax cuts or social investment was a top priority, 49 per cent opted for social investment.</P>
      <P>There is one specific taxation issue that I would like to address. The upsurge in house prices in recent years requires a review of the capital gains tax code. The Labour Party supports the concept of capital taxation which should play a key role in the taxation policies of the State and our objection to the slashing of capital gains tax in the first budget of the Minister for Finance has been well aired in this House and other forums. As my colleague, Deputy McDowell, indicated last night, there is a group for whom the capital acquisitions tax code as it applies to housing is causing difficulties. I am referring in particular to those who shared a family home with either their parents or a close relative for a number of years before acquiring the house. As we are all aware, given the rapid rise in house prices, many of them cannot afford to pay the tax due on the estate. Sons or daughters who may have lived in the family home all their lives, often caring for a sick or elderly parent, are forced to sell their house and move out of the locality to meet the tax bill. This is not fair.</P>

      <P>I wish to focus on the proposal in the Labour Party amendment which calls on the Government to abandon its commitment to a 4 per cent ceiling in public spending increases in favour of a figure commensurate with either the rate of GNP growth or the projected increase in taxation income, whichever is higher. It is inappropriate at this stage in our economic develop<Col N="919" /> ment that we should be limited to a 4 per cent increase in public spending. Even though this could now be described as a rich economy, the gap is growing between those who are doing well and those who are gaining little from current riches.</P>
      <P>There is a need to draw a line in the sand in terms of what an egalitarian society will tolerate in a rich economy. There are many circumstances that we can no longer tolerate considering how much extra money is available in the coffers of the Minister for Finance, including where elderly parents cannot find a suitable placement for a mentally handicapped son or daughter. I support fully the recommendation of the National Association for the Mentally Handicap of Ireland that appropriate accommodation be provided for all those included in the database as a matter of urgency. People with physical disabilities are literally imprisoned in their homes. This is not tolerable in a society as rich as this. Other recommendations extend to personal assistants, a cost of disability payment, the availability of carer's allowance without a means test to those who provide full-time care and attention and appropriate resource centres for people with disabilities, all of which should be provided in a rich economy.</P>
      <P>The fact that many people are homeless should not be tolerated, nor should lack of access to health services. I know of one 84 year old man living alone in a rural area who has been waiting four years for a knee replacement operation. Given that there are people in society who cannot read, there is a need to provide remedial teachers in all schools and to provide for access to adult literacy services and legal redress. There is a need to alter the current 4 per cent on public spending to meet these basic requirements.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCreevy will probably go down in history as one of the most radical Ministers for Finance. In his first two budgets he delivered the most reforming finance packages in the history of the State. He introduced budgets that have tried to give every citizen some sense of sharing in the spoils of the Celtic tiger economy. It had been a common complaint that the much talked about tiger was delivering little to those who had suffered and sacrificed most to bring about this economic miracle. It was only right that those who had taken the pain should share in the gain. The £600 million tax reform package announced in the last budget aimed at the poor and less well off was welcomed across all sections of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was controlled in his first two budgets which were radical and progressive and <Col N="920" /> aimed at the lower end of the tax regime. He raised the income tax threshold with the result that no single person earning less than £100 per week is subject to PAYE or PRSI. He reduced the standard and higher rates of tax by 2 per cent while the tax bands were widened to £14,000 for a single person and £28,000 for a married couple. The increases in welfare benefits are unprecedented. The Government is committed to paying old age pensioners £100 per week during its lifetime.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced far-reaching changes in the corporation tax code. The standard rate has been reduced to 28 per cent with a threshold of £100,000 for a reduced rate of 25 per cent. The standard rate will fall to 12.5 per cent by 2003. The reduced rates have assisted in reaching the point where there is near full employment and are of particular benefit to small companies in terms of increased development where cashflow is normally tight and borrowing capacity stretched. The transition to a standard rate of 12.5 per cent by 2003 will have far-reaching consequences for corporate tax policy and will make Ireland an attractive location for service type or medium to long-term financial type enterprises. The mainstream coporate tax rate will be lower than that applying in countries from which the bulk of our inward investment is sourced. Because tax uncertainty is removed, companies can plan significantly ahead knowing the implications of their investment. The new incentives will encourage employee share participation and create harmony in industrial relations. This should further assist employment growth and continued expansion of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister was criticised for halving the rate of capital gains tax to 20 per cent. It has, however, proved to be a most efficient move in that the takings from this tax have increased significantly and scuppered the theory that increased rates of taxes were the only means of increasing the tax take. There was much criticism when he introduced the new rates, but they eliminated many of the under-the-counter transactions which took place in the sale of properties or assets. That measure has generated a significant amount of increased revenue.</P>
    <P>The changes introduced by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in the control of pensions for the self-employed were the most radical ever. Control of the accumulated pension fund remains with the individual and is passed on to his estate on death. Previously, people were obliged to invest in an annuity which, by and large, ceased on death. In addition, the Minister significantly increased the extent of the yearly contribution allowed for tax purposes, thereby encouraging individuals to increase their pension contributions. I was hoping the Minister would be here tonight because I wanted to ask him to consider reducing the capital gains tax on commercial development lands. He might also consider doing what he did in regard to residential lands last year. That would provide a stimulus for further <Col N="921" /> boosting the economic development of our country. I hope the Minister's officials will tell him about my proposal because it is an important next step.</P>
    <P>We look forward to additional incentives in the tax regime in future budgets. Adjustments can be made in the following areas: an increase in tax allowances and bands, thereby ensuring that those on lower wages are fully exempt from tax and that the ordinary worker remains in the standard rate category; adjustments for parents facing child care fees; increased welfare benefits for the less well off; and assistance in the housing market for those on lower incomes.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned capital acquisitions tax. The Minister is currently reviewing this area and I hope we will see some changes in the budget in that regard. The value of properties and family homes has escalated and there are enormous implications for those who inherit family homes in terms of capital acquisitions tax. I hope the Minister will carefully examine this area and introduce measures in the budget.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on the low unemployment rate and on its target to achieve full employment in the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council recently published a booklet which sets the parameters for the social partnership discussions due to take place shortly. It states that average employment growth from 1994-98 was about 4.9 per cent and, apart from Luxembourg, the nearest country to us in the European Union was The Netherlands, which was just over 2 per cent. It indicates also that in April 1993 the unemployment rate was at 16 per cent and it is now down to 5.2 per cent. The long-term unemployment rate in April 1994 was 9 per cent and it is now down to 2.5 per cent. Irish living standards as a percentage of the EU average increased from 58 per cent in 1988 to 93 per cent ten years later. That does not take into account the significant percentage increase in real take home pay in 1999 which is estimated at 7.5 per cent for a married person and 5 per cent for a single person after tax and inflation. That should bring Irish living standards as a percentage of the EU average close to 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>The NESC booklet also states that the foundations of a successful society are a dynamic economy and a participatory society incorporating a commitment to social justice based on consistent economic development that is socially and environmentally sustainable and which responds to the constantly evolving requirements of international competitiveness. It further states that that vision has several important dimensions, one of which is economic inclusion based on full employment. That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to hear any more pious platitudes about low paid workers being economically included. I would like to see the minimum wage increased to £5.50 per hour, that is £220 per week. That would give everybody an incentive to work. <Col N="922" /> The Labour Party does not have the bottle to propose a minimum wage of £5 per hour. If this side of the House had originally proposed £2.50 per hour, the Labour Party would probably propose £3 per hour.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>A minimum wage of £220 per week is needed and the social partners should not allow for relativities in this regard. That is a basic wage which everyone should be paid, and this country can afford to pay it, but I would not like the various professions and trades to view that as a base on which they can seek relativity increases.</P>
      <P>On the question of child care, the State should pay for child care for children of any parent who wants to have their child cared for in a well managed, well regulated, competitive and privatised child care facility up to a fixed amount per week agreed as the norm in the industry. During the 1970s, 50 per cent of the population were under the age of 25. That seventies baby boom is the engine of our current economic growth. Every country in Europe envies our well educated young people who are working here, paying good taxes and driving our economy. We want that to be the case in ten and 20 years' time but it can only happen if we care for the children in this society, and it is the State's responsibility to provide good child care.</P>
      <P>Another dimension to this vision is social inclusion reflecting full participation in those activities which constitute the norm in society. There should be equality of opportunity and access to education, employment, health, housing and social services. A recent opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> indicated that only 9 per cent of people wanted a reduction in taxes as against an improvement in services. There is an immediate need for those services to be fully available to all people, regardless of their income or their living standards. Under the Fine Gael proposal, a person earning up to £100,000 would have a 10 per cent increase in take home pay, but there would be no significant change for the person earning approximately £35,000.</P>

      <P>There is an urgent need for investment in infrastructure. There is a problem in regard to housing, roads and traffic. I would like to see Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo developed to a significant degree, with trains and high speed buses running on a regular basis between Dublin and the various cities. It should take only an hour and a half to get to Cork, the same time that it currently takes to get from Firhouse in County Dublin to the centre of Dublin. It is only by increasing the population in those areas as against increasing it in Dublin we will be able to manage supply-demand in regard to housing, and it would also reduce the need for cars. If there is further development within 20 or <Col N="923" /> 30 miles of Dublin, families will require two cars to allow them get into the city to bring their children to school, visit the theatre or whatever.</P>
      <P>If the Fine Gael motion and the Labour amendment are the best the Opposition can come up with, those of us on this side of the House will have to strengthen our resolve and work harder to develop even more innovative ways of achieving a successful society because the Opposition is a disaster.</P>

      <P>Coming from a business background, I want to acknowledge the achievement of the Government in developing our economy into the success story it is today. It has become a model for, and is the envy of, the rest of Europe. It is not so long ago that we were trying to attract industry from abroad by tax breaks, which were promoted by the IDA. We have now come full circle, in that investors are now looking for a skilled workforce.</P>
      <P>The time has come to examine in connection with the preparation of the budget what is happening in regard to the availability of skilled workers. Skilled Irish people who emigrated some years age are now anxious to return. The time has come for us to advertise, whether on the Internet or as a Government, to ensure that foreign investors have skilled workforces available to them. We will have to advertise tax breaks for returning emigrants, as we did in the past to attract foreign companies, in order to resettle qualified, skilled Irish people who are abroad. That is essential to ensure the further development of industry here. The Government should target specific areas of skill shortages. We should examine the possibility of giving a once-off tax break to Irish families living abroad who possess skills that are in short supply at home.</P>
      <P>We have developed our economy to the point where we must look at innovative ways to deal with business in the future. E-commerce offers this country a better possibility for future success than any other industry. E-commerce runs across every section of our community and we must encourage its use by indigenous industry and by Government. I believe in the phrase &ldquo;e-government at the speed of light&rdquo;. In order to achieve that, we must encourage people to become more involved in e-commerce. Tax breaks should be given to those who are willing to invest in e-commerce, particularly those who create new jobs.</P>
      <P>Information technology is the future basis of development here. Every home that purchases a PC should receive a once-off £1,000 income tax break. That is essential in order to achieve inclusiveness, in terms of information technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred during the Private Member's debate on agriculture to a group which we have almost not acknowledged; that is, the people who worked hard and invested in banks and shares <Col N="924" /> over the years to build the economy we are enjoying today. They did so on the basis that they would have a reasonable income when they retired. They are now getting little or no return on the money they invested. Given that we can afford to do so, it is time to give a break to those people who helped to build our successful economy, so that they can earn a decent income on the money they invested. If we cannot do that, we should devise some method of bonds or other instrument which the Government can sell to them, which would give them an opportunity to earn money on investments they made in the hope of earning good money from them in their retirement years. That has not happened and the onus is on the Government to ensure that sector is given a break.</P>
    <P>There are people living on the land in hardship, while the rest of us benefit from the economic boom. There should be some way of reaching out to those people, whether by way of tax breaks, a special retirement scheme or extending the existing retirement schemes, to bring them into the net so that they can receive a proper income in their retirement. These people are often on their own on the land. They did not work it as a business but because they are part and parcel of the land and see it as a way of life. They are now left on their own because their families have taken up employment in other sectors. Any developing community or society is best judged on how it treats the less well-off. If we are a mature economy and a mature political structure, we should acknowledge the input of these people into the building of our very sound economic base.</P>
    <P>I support the request by carers for greater recognition, in terms of personal assistants. That scheme has given them the opportunity to participate fully in the economic growth of the country. It has given them an enjoyable quality of life and has afforded them the opportunity to get out of their homes, where they were once prisoners. It has given employment to people. Those schemes should be adjusted so that that employment as a carer does not have to be terminated at the end of 12 months but can be extended beyond that. If we do that, we will give a better life to people who, up to now, have been locked in their homes. We should extend that service.</P>
    <P>I would love to see an allowance introduced for child care. There are untapped skills in homes where women had to leave their place of employment and stay at home to rear their family and be a homemaker. These women, who may have skilled themselves up to participate fully in information technology, e-commerce or other new developments, should be given the opportunity to return to the workforce, by providing them with child care. That would alleviate problems that are occurring throughout the country, where a skilled workforce is locked at home caring for children and the household and are anxious to get back to work. It would give them the opportunity to participate fully and would lighten the burden on <Col N="925" /> employers who are having difficulties in getting employees.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on the tax policies pursued by the Government over the past two years. This motion reminds me of a Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill, where the Opposition tries to up the ante on what has been proposed by the Government. I note from the amendment tabled by the Labour Party that it is upping the ante on Fine Gael. Fine Gael wants the first £170 of weekly income to be tax free and the Labour Party wants that figure to be £195. Fine Gael wants the standard rate band to be £17,500 for single people and £35,000 for married people, and Labour wants it to be £20,000 for single people and £40,000 for married people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for such a weak motion is quite clear &ndash; the effectiveness of the progressive economic policies, including the taxation policies, pursued by the Government since 1997. I take some small pleasure in those policies, having worked with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, while in Opposition to prepare policies to turn around this economy. The tax burden has been reduced considerably for all taxpayers in the past two years. There has also been an increase in employment due to the incentives introduced and large numbers of low income earners have been taken out of the tax net. The burden of tax on the lower paid, the elderly and widowed parents has also been reduced. In addition, there has been a significant move towards a progressive system of tax credits and I hope the Minister will continue in that direction in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> In the last two budgets the Minister delivered £1.1 billion in tax reductions, far above the level called for in the national agreements. He has implemented the most significant tax reform measures of any Minister in the history of the State. Over 80,000 taxpayers have been taken out of the tax net in the past two years and special reliefs have been provided for the most vulnerable in society. The Minister outlined these <Col N="926" /> measures in his contribution to this debate. People over 65 years of age are benefiting from up to 40 per cent increases in the exemption limit. The increased bereavement allowance and the job assist scheme were introduced to benefit the long-term unemployed and show the social and caring concerns of the Government.</P>
    <P>Last year saw the introduction of a move towards tax credits, another of our important policy objectives. This had been called for during the past 15 years and will ensure a fairer distribution of tax benefits to all taxpayers, particularly those at the lower end of the scale. I await further details of the timetable for the completion of the move to a full tax credit system in next month's budget.</P>
    <P>In our policy document we made it clear that we would reduce the higher and standard tax rates. A combination of measures involving PRSI, levies and income tax has reduced contributions and will ensure that no one on the higher rate will pay more than 50 per cent. We have already reduced the standard rate. To promote job creation, special tax allowances were granted to employers who take people off the long-term unemployment register. These workers are allowed to retain medical cards and other benefits and to receive unemployment benefit for three years at a reduced yearly rate. These measures have been successful as can be seen from the fact that employers are experiencing difficulties finding workers. Given the dearth of employees it is worth considering Deputy McGuinness's call for a special tax allowance to bring people back from abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister's capital gains tax proposals were originally scoffed at but have stimulated investment in the economy. These measures were needed at the time and have proved extremely successful, however, they must be continually reviewed to see if it is necessary to change policy direction. Capital acquisitions tax is a problem which raised its head due to the increase in house prices. A mathematician informed me that, if the price increases in housing were used as a criteria for the exemption from CAT, the level would be at £3.5 million. The Minister is considering increasing the CAT exemption allowance in the forthcoming budget which is important for many people caring for their parents.</P>
    <P>The success of the Government's policies are there to be seen. GNP increased by 25 per cent between 1997 and 1999, the numbers at work have grown by over 10 per cent in the past two years, unemployment has fallen from 10 per cent to just over 5 per cent and inflation is under control at less than 2 per cent, one of the lowest rates in the EU. Government debt has reduced significantly, the tax burden on all taxpayers has been reduced and more than 80,000 people, at least, have been taken out of the tax net. This trend will continue in future years.</P>

      <P>When the Government took office two years ago I drew an analogy with a football manager taking over Manchester United. I was proven correct in that Manchester United and the country have thrived. The term &ldquo;Celtic tiger&rdquo; was coined during the period when the rainbow coalition was in office. Government speakers could be a little more magnanimous in recognising the contribution all parties have made over the past ten years towards the economic boom we are experiencing. However, they are disingenuous about most things, particularly in regard to the economy. They forget the bad years between 1977-82 when Fianna Fáil was in office and almost destroyed the country, but they always refer to the better years.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael's tax policy at the last election was to target all tax concessions at the lower to middle income groups. That policy is now being pursued by the Government. In its first budget, the Government examined the tax rates but has now come round to our way of thinking on taxation. The way to ensure that SMEs survive, particularly those in rural areas, is through tax cuts rather than pay increases. This is a simple fact. Any new national agreement will have to be driven by tax reductions rather than large wage increases which reduce competitiveness locally and nationally. That is what Fine Gael's policy is all about. The next agreement will have to be driven by moderation in pay demands and major taxation concessions.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion before the House would benefit lower income groups. I compliment Deputy Noonan on introducing an innovative tax proposal. Many of our proposals were taken up by other parties in the past and we have driven the issue of tax reform for a number of years.</P>
      <P>During last year's debate on the budget and the Finance Bill I stressed that in so far as possible lower income groups must be removed from the tax net. The removal of the first £170 is reasonable and is not a major concession. It would create a wedge between being on social welfare and working, especially for families. A major problem in rural and other areas is that people are less attracted to work in low paid jobs than to stay on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of a new 35 per cent middle income tax rate seems very practical. Certainly the leap from 24 per cent to 46 per cent is too dramatic. Like VRT where there is a middle rate, <Col N="928" /> there should be a middle rate of income tax. I stressed this during the debate on the Finance Act last year and I think I tabled an amendment in that regard. I am glad Deputy Noonan took up this very creative proposal when he was producing his tax policy. It is unfortunate Deputy Ardagh is not present as he deserves to be answered by Deputy Noonan. The average industrial wage is £15,400 per annum while the average wage is over £17,000 per annum. This proposal will ensure all taxpayers earning up to or just above the average wage will pay tax only at the standard rate, something which should be welcomed by everybody. I think the Minister for Finance will address this matter in the budget and I would not be a bit surprised if he took on board Deputy Noonan's proposal.</P>
    <P>Despite the Government's promise that 80 per cent of taxpayers would pay tax at the standard rate only, currently about 44 per cent of taxpayers are liable at the higher rate while 56.1 per cent are liable to tax at the standard rate. Fine Gael's proposed extension of the standard rate band would remove 186,000 taxpayers from the higher rate. Some 70 per cent of taxpayers would pay tax at the standard rate while a further 25 per cent would pay tax at the middle income rate of 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>Overall Deputy Noonan's proposals are very creative and futuristic. I am not a betting man, but I am sure many of these proposals will be taken on board by the Minister in the budget. If we are to remain competitive and if small SMEs are to survive, we need a package similar to that proposed by Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this motion and my front bench colleague, Deputy Noonan, on the work he has done in relation to tax policy. As far as I am concerned, the commitments given in our tax policy are manifesto commitments we will be putting forward in the next general election irrespective of the budget or responses by the Government. We feel very strongly that the timing of this debate, in a week in which talks have opened with all the social partners on a successor to Partnership 2000, sets a proper context for continuing the trend of a trade off between lower competitive pay increases and bigger increases in net take home pay by virtue of tax reform and tax reductions.</P>
      <P>Over the lifetime of Partnership 2000 a consistent feature has been a gross underestimate of income tax revenues in each budget and a substantial overshoot of actual revenues. This is because the number of people at work and the total income payable have drifted upwards on an enormous scale. The cost of a £2 billion package must be seen in this context. Each year successive Ministers for Finance have given away £400 million, £500 million or £700 million only to find their targets completely over-shot and a significantly smaller net cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic features of our proposal are to extend the standard rate of tax so 160,000 will <Col N="929" /> pay the lowest rate of tax, to deal with the most crippling inequity in the European tax system, namely, the feature here where a single person hits the top rate of tax at £14,000, and to ensure a single person does not pay more than 35 per cent tax on an income up to £50,000. We believe the super rich should pay a top rate of tax and that the Progressive Democrats are wrong to say everybody should have a lower top rate of tax. Middle income earners should pay a middle rate of tax. It is absolutely outrageous and fundamentally contradictory to introduce by law a minimum wage of £4.40 per hour, giving a total of £179 per 39 hour week, and to confiscate some of that income in tax.</P>
    <P>These features, together with our child care policy of paying an increase in child benefit of £25 per week for children under five years of age, are fundamental to making more people attracted to the workforce The biggest impediment to the continued growth of the Celtic tiger is not interest rates or a crash in the NASDAQ, but the shortage of workers. Virtually every business in the public and private sectors in this city finds there are insufficient applicants for many positions. A fundamental feature of managing a business today concerns the shortage of people with skills &ndash; I am talking about relatively semi-skilled jobs &ndash; available to satisfy the current growth in jobs. This must be resolved and it can only be done by moving from welfare to work and attracting more women into the workforce.</P>
    <P>Our comprehensive series of proposals deal with child care, namely, the supply side in terms of capitation grants, and the fundamental problems of housing, infrastructure and transport. These are the issues on which the next general election will be fought. This tax policy commends itself not only to the Government but will ultimately commend itself to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for providing an opportunity to debate this issue over the past two nights. The proposals he has put forward on behalf of Fine Gael have led to an open and frank discussion throughout the country. Employers and workers have serious problems. The social welfare system and low paid jobs cannot go hand in hand unless there is a change in taxation. There are 3,000 people in County Monaghan on the live register. Yet almost every company or business has difficulty finding employees because of the high level of taxation imposed on those in lower paid jobs. One has to ensure that those on low and middle incomes are removed from the tax net as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The low turnout in the recent by-election can be clearly seen as a result of problems associated with tax. There have been promises in past budgets that many people will be better off following their implementation. However, people find that when they get a slight increase in wages they enter a higher tax bracket and are very little better off. Century Homes in my constituency is an example of an enterprise which has a factory floor <Col N="930" /> awaiting employees. It has had to move to Longford because of the difficulty in getting employees, a very sad and serious situation. Other businesses are seeking employees far afield.</P>
    <P>I support the proposals put forward by Deputy Noonan, not just because he is Fine Gael's spokesperson on finance, but because they are real and give people an opportunity to opt for work rather than social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware of another group which is outside the gates of Leinster House tonight which would love to have tax to pay. It is important the Minister for Finance finds the few pounds necessary to help the pig farmers who have suffered as a result of a fire, a calamity outside their control. It has put many of them out of business. Contrary to what the Minister, Deputy Walsh, said in last week's <i>Irish Farmer's Journal</i>, it is not two farmers who have gone out of business in the Border region but dozens. More will follow if the necessary £4.8 million is not found quickly.</P>
    <P>It is important to ask the Minister to act now. The Minister of State, who is a pig farmer in his own right, met farmers' representatives today and failed to give them any encouragement or commitment. The Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development must get together and solve this problem once and for all. If that once-off payment were made, these farmers could be in the tax net next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion which calls on the Government to be aware of the increasing labour shortage in the economy, be conscious of the deterioration in industrial relations in the public sector and support the negotiation of another partnership agreement. The most important element in the motion, however, is the call for the introduction of a new middle rate of income tax at 35 per cent which would apply to incomes ranging from £17,500 to £50,000 for a single person and from £35,000 to £100,000 for married people.</P>
      <P>There is a growing need for the introduction of a three tier system of income tax. The poorest sector of the community is the middle income group. They are being bled white by the amount of income tax taken from them each week. It is a necessity for a young married couple to have two incomes to repay the colossal mortgage they are obliged to incur to purchase a home if they wish to settle down and rear a family. The Minister for Finance would be wise to accept this motion, particularly the introduction of a third tax rate. It is virtually guaranteed that we will not have to wait long for the mortgage rates to start increasing. When that happens, the people on middle incomes will be in serious trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The underprivileged section of the community is also feeling the pinch. Take as an example the old age pensioners living in rural areas. They do not have free transport like their urban counter<Col N="931" /> parts. There is no such thing as a bus service to collect people in outlying rural areas. What good is that to the pensioners and other people who are entitled to free travel? What use is it if they live 20 miles away from a bus route and might only see the doors of a bus once or twice a year? These people are neglected. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to urge the Minister for Finance to give favourable consideration to promoting a system of transport to aid these forgotten people. They must hire a taxi to go to mass on Sunday. These old age pensioners, many of them disabled, should be looked after.</P>
    <P>The winter fuel scheme provides them with only £5 per week. That sum would not buy a bucket of coal, and heat is a most important commodity for elderly people. I urge the Minister to at least double that amount to £10 per week in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>It is well known that farmers' incomes have dwindled. I challenge the Minister to call to the local mart in his constituency and see cattle of 500kg being sold for £450. A calf made that price three years ago. No wonder the farmers are parading outside Leinster House. In the past two years sheep farmers would not be given £1 for a mountain ewe in a fair in any part of west Cork or south Kerry. Then we are told about the massive influx of money and what the Celtic tiger is doing for the economy. The Celtic tiger is invisible in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Finance the necessity to give small farmers a decent measure of relief. They were offered the farm assist scheme this year. The farmers who were in receipt of unemployment assistance were told to reapply as they would be entitled to more. Instead, their unemployment assistance was cut off because the social welfare officers took potential sales into consideration. Live horse and one will get grass. The Minister is applying a penal system to assess farm incomes. The potential sales might never accrue. Many of the cattle and sheep could die during a bad winter so why assess them as potential sales? Why not assess the sales they have in the relevant year? Common sense should prevail.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, will influence the Minister for Finance to at least give recognition to the fact that life is extremely bleak in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Noonan on bringing this matter before the House. The Minister for Finance will announce the budget in a few weeks and, in broad economic terms, it must deal with two important issues. First, it must ensure continued and stable growth in the economy and, second, it must address the growing divide between rich and poor which is the result of our prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the financial control mechanisms which the Government had at its disposal in previous years are no longer available because those <Col N="932" /> decisions are made at European level. However, the Government still has control of income tax, its most important weapon in formulating the budget. I am proud that Fine Gael is leading the way in the debate on income tax reform, with new and imaginative proposals that are tailor made for modern Ireland and the challenges it faces. I hope the Government is not too proud to take on board our policies on tax reform because they make sense.</P>
    <P>We propose that people who earn less than £170 per week should not have to pay income tax. This will ensure that when the minimum wage is introduced next year a person on that wage will not pay income tax. This step would ensure a move from the mentality of social welfare reliance that some people still have to a desire for employment. A simple increase in take home pay would mean such a move would be financially beneficial and it would make sense to work rather than draw the dole.</P>
    <P>Consistent with Fine Gael proposals last year, we want the standard rate of tax band widened from £14,100 to £17,500 for a single person and double that amount for a married couple. As a result, people earning an average wage or a little more would be taxed at only the standard rate. That would remove 186,000 taxpayers from paying the higher tax rate and ensure 70 per cent of workers would be taxed at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>The most radical reform in our proposals is perhaps the introduction of a new 35 per cent tax band for incomes between £17,500 and £50,000 for a single person and double that amount for a married couple. This would eliminate the major jump in income tax rates for middle income earners who start to make a little more money. Only the top 5 per cent of earners &ndash; the very wealthy &ndash; would pay tax at the higher tax rate of 46 per cent.</P>
    <P>These proposals, if implemented, would attract home many young and middle aged Irish people who went abroad for economic and social reasons, and it would make financial sense for them to come home. Our economy needs them. A major threat to the growth of many small and medium sized businesses is the lack of availability of skilled and unskilled labour. We want to create a taxation policy that focuses not only on the needs of the majority of taxpayers, both employers and employees, and ensures sustainable growth for our economy, but which also deals with social injustice and poverty. The best way to tackle poverty and social division is to attempt to create full employment by giving people every feasible financial incentive to work. Fine Gael tax proposals attempt to achieve that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 160,000 small firms currently operate in our economy, but only 4 per cent of those firms employ more than 50 people and the average number employed in them is 13. The higher tax rate of 46 per cent must be reduced. I compliment Deputy Noonan on <Col N="933" /> tabling this imaginative motion. It provides some encouragement to business at a time when employers find it difficult to retain staff. In a high skills and high earning economy such as ours, incentives must be provided to ensure that our skills base is maintained. A tax rate of 46 per cent in tandem with employers' PRSI, as introduced in last year's budget, is, effectively, a tax on skills and must be alleviated. A major part of the problem is the vast difference between people's gross and net salaries. I welcome the proposal to introduce a minimum wage, but given that almost half of what most people earn is taken back in taxation, major tax reform is required.</P>
      <P>Jobs created in the service industry must be decentralised. Well serviced supertowns with independent infrastructure would provide suitable alternative locations for many small businesses. The Government must give a firm commitment to such a policy and must invest in it. It must be seen to lead by example by the further decentralisation of Government Departments and State agencies. Employers find it difficult to retain staff and the lack of child care facilities also poses a major problem in this regard.</P>

      <P>In speaking on this motion I will not join in any simplistic chorus, which calls for giveaway tax cuts. What we need is taxation justice, not taxation reduction.</P>
      <P>After a very disappointing first budget from the Government, there was some progress in the 1999 budget towards taking the lower paid out of the tax net, but much more needs to be done. The gap between the higher and the lower income groups has widened. It is essential that two measures are undertaken by the Government in the forthcoming budget, first, a measure to increase significantly the level of income at which people enter the tax net and, second, a measure to introduce a minimum wage at the rate of £5 per hour with a firm commitment to increase this very modest rate in due course.</P>
      <P>I am totally opposed to the continuing cuts in corporation tax being made by the Government. It is squandering revenue, which is vital for our health and education services. The Government is throwing away a rich funding vein for our health care and education needs.</P>
      <P>Instead of tax cuts, we must have more of our revenue take spent on redressing the economic imbalance within and between the regions in this State. The Border counties still lag far behind the rest of the economy in real terms. We, in the Border region, continue to suffer the legacy of partition and years of neglect by successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advocate progressive taxation, which will harness the unprecedented revenue available to the Government, so we can provide the services for which citizens are glad to see their tax money used. Housing, health care, roads, public transport and education are all vital needs. Targeted public spending can provide real improvements in these services and in the quality of life gener<Col N="934" /> ally. Tax cuts, on the other hand, will lead to spiralling personal spending on consumables in the main.</P>
    <P>Special taxation measures are needed to tackle the housing crisis. I advocate an increase in capital gains tax on property speculators. An increase in taxation on speculative house purchasers should be introduced. I support the Labour Party amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, welcomed the opportunity for a debate on taxation policy facilitated by this Private Members' motion. Over the past two nights, speakers have identified many of the main challenges &ndash; emerging labour shortages, difficulties with child care, problems in the housing market &ndash; which face this country as we approach the new millennium, and their vision of the role taxation measures can play in confronting these challenges.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposed an amended motion and I urge Members to support it for a number of reasons. Members will recognise that major steps have been taken by the Government to date to secure and build on our economic achievements. The Government's vision of how this success can be built on into the future involves strategic investment in key areas of physical, economic and social infrastructure, renewal of social partnership to maintain and improve our competitiveness and achieve fair distribution of the fruits of our economic growth, prudent management of the public finances, including taking into account the longer term challenges such as changing demographics and further reform of the tax system to support these objectives.</P>
      <P>These objectives will be addressed through a coherent set of strategies over the next three years of this Government encompassed by the Government's new Action Plan for the Millennium published last week; the national development plan, which will be published next week, and, we hope, the outcome of the new partnership negotiations, which were opened yesterday by the Taoiseach. The next three budgets of the Government will be prepared within this overall strategic framework.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that I cannot outline here the measures the forthcoming budget will contain. However, I assure the House that the personal taxation measures are being carefully framed to continue on the programme of tax reform, which has been so successfully advanced in the last two budgets of this Government. It is worth reiterating the basic elements of our approach, removing low paid taxpayers from the tax net altogether, reducing current income tax rates, increasing the numbers of taxpayers on the standard rate and moving to a full tax credits system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the specifics of taxation measures are concerned, I welcome the exchange that has taken place during this debate. There is a <Col N="935" /> measure of agreement about the priority issues for personal taxation and there is some shared vision about the goals for tax reform, such as continuing to remove lower income taxpayers form the tax net and widening the standard rate bank to increase the entry point to the higher 46 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>While the overall thrust of the package proposed by Deputy Noonan is not totally out of line with the Government's tax reform programme, the emphasis and balance of different measures will vary. As was said last night, we do not see the need for a new 35 per cent intermediate rate proposed, as a new and more complicated rate structure is not needed to achieve our objectives of tax reform and lower tax for all taxpayers. I question the focus of the Fine Gael income tax proposal that would target a large element of the budget tax packages on higher earners. Similarly, the proposal from Deputy McDowell to widen the standard band by more than 40 per cent would not do anything for those on income levels below the top of the standard band, single people earning less than £14,000 per annum and married couples earning less than £28,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendment proposed by Deputy McDowell, and in particular his call on the Government to abandon its 4 per cent ceiling on public expenditure increases, the Government does not intend to pursue such a course. We will not jeopardise the success which has been achieved through the efforts and sacrifices over more difficult years through a short-term and short-sighted approach to public spending. We will continue our prudent management of resources so that we meet clear and necessary public spending needs and plan for the longer term costs, such as those associated with the ageing of our population.</P>
    <P>Deputies spoke at length last night about how budgetary measures should be designed to help the labour market and to ease child care difficulties. These are important issues which will be addressed in the budget. Deputies spoke less about increasing equity in the tax system which was such a fundamental part of last year's budget. This was the radical change in our personal taxation system with the beginning of the move to a tax credits system through the standard rating of the basic personal allowances. The basic philosophy of this move is that tax credits mean, for a given Exchequer cost, that more resources are devoted to those on lower incomes. Tax credits will herald a major sea change in attitudes to welfare and work for many and an unquestionable improvement in the incentive to work. We will announce our timescale for moving to a full tax credits system on budget day.</P>
    <P>Three weeks from today the Minister for Finance will outline the details of the Government's tax package. This will set out the measures to continue our ambitious programme of tax reform so that the fruits of our economic success are shared by all, our taxation system supports the <Col N="936" /> continued development of our country and the needs of the less advantaged members of our society are addressed. For the reasons I have outlined, I ask Deputies to support the amendment proposed by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion and I commend Deputy Noonan for tabling it.</P>
      <P>The motion proposes to eliminate from the tax net all PAYE workers earning less than £150 per week, to extend the standard tax band rate to remove 160,000 workers from the top rate of tax and to create a new 35 per cent rate for all workers other than the top 5 per cent of earners. These welcome measures are long overdue. If implemented, they would make it more attractive for people on low incomes to work and to contribute to the economy. It is also a family friendly package. In the past our high tax rates caused many young professional people and skilled workers to leave Ireland at a great loss to our workforce and to our economy and its potential growth.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace, given our current wealth, that there is a shortfall in the number of services for our most vulnerable citizens. On behalf of all people and groups representing the sensory and physical disability sector, I ask the Minister to allow tax relief on personal donations to domestic charities and to allow them to reclaim VAT. This would mean that vital funding would be freed up which would have a great impact on the most needy in our society.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to include the middle Shannon area in the rural tax renewal designation pilot scheme. An area from Ballinasloe to Portumna and across to the Clare border is caught in a no man's land between the Shannon free tax zone and the upper Shannon incentives area. I ask the Minister to level the playing pitch for those who cannot attract investment into this area.</P>

      <P>This Government has singularly failed to deal with the child care crisis. Ireland is the only country in the EU with such a crisis. Steps must be taken to supply well managed, regulated and affordable child care facilities. Tinkering with the issue will not be enough. If an earthquake hit this country, money would be found to deal with the problems that would follow. Money must now be found to rectify this child care problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 there were 146,000 children in paid child care, of which 58 per cent were of working mothers. We must urgently provide child care for these children up to five years of age. Minders <Col N="937" /> are more popular for children from five to nine years of age. There were 860,000 children under 14 years of age in the State in 1996. There will be little change in the total number of child care places in the medium term. In 1996 the female labour force was 589,000. It is predicted that by 2011 there will be 807,000 females at work. This will significantly increase the demand for more child care places. It is predicted that the minimum increase will be 40,000 extra places, or 25 per cent of an increase, while the maximum increase will be 75,000 extra places, which is more than 50 per cent of an increase.</P>
    <P>Employment has increased, particularly for female workers. This has contributed significantly to the continuing success of our economy and our economic growth. With more people employed, there are fewer people able to stay at home with their children. The cost of living, particularly that of providing a home, gives young couples no choice, yet some are forced to discontinue working or to provide inadequate child care. The child must be central to any decision. If parents are forced to accept inadequate child care, it will have severe negative effects on the development of the child.</P>
    <P>The Government must take action. New guidelines specifically state that an affordable, accessible and high quality care service for children and for their dependants must be provided. The Government must introduce an employment action plan to recognise the crucial role parents play in ensuring that every opportunity is given to their children to have a safe, secure and loving environment in the most formative years of their lives. The plan should facilitate choice and combine parenting and work in the paid economy. This would help to recognise the crucial role both parents play in the formative years of their children's lives. The plan must include the development of a child care strategy, promote flexibility in the work organisation and provide affordable and targeted child care.</P>
    <P>The cost of care is prohibitive. Depending on the area of the country, the cost of child care is between £44 and £71 per week per child. This is the highest cost in Europe and is equal to 20 per cent of the average earnings. What chance does a young student mother, a lone parent, an unemployed person or a low income family have if such charges must be paid? Child benefit for children under the age of five must be increased to at least £25 per week. In Norway payments of £400 to £500 per month are paid for each child under five years of age.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis in the supply side. The Minister must introduce capital grants and capitation payments to providers to enable them to increase the quality and quantity of child care and pre-school facilities. There is a crisis in training child care workers. The Government must introduce incentives for training child care staff to promote quality employment opportunities in the sector and it must provide funding for local measures to develop after school and child care networks, D510&ndash;C4</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> particularly in disadvantaged communities, using existing infrastructures wherever possible. It must introduce new planning regulations to facilitate the provision of child care services close to local communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a timely motion and its importance can be gauged by the number of speakers wishing to contribute to the debate. I congratulate Deputy Noonan on bringing it forward. He has produced a very imaginative and realistic tax plan. Despite the early efforts to discredit it from the Government side and from the less enlightened sections of the Opposition it has stood the test of scrutiny and following detailed examination has been welcomed in many quarters.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister outlined some of the reasons for the recent success of our economy and spoke about the decisions taken in the area of education. I have encountered many families who cannot afford to send their children to third level institutions because they are not in receipt of the education grant. In many instances these people are in good public service jobs but they represent the new poor. I hope the Minister will make provision to raise the income level for eligibility for this grant.</P>
      <P>Approximately 117,000 people receive widows and orphans contributory and non-contributory pensions which range from £73.50 to £82.10 per week. I hope these people can be given a meaningful increase in their pensions. I realise it is easy to look for payments but these and other such cases should be addressed even if we have to wait for tax cuts, particularly at the upper end of the scale. In last year's budget the Minister improved the position of carers at an annual cost of £18 million. I look forward to an improvement on this in the coming weeks as this area should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on proposing the concept of town renewal and I ask the officials of the Department of Finance &ndash; I know that the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works finds it difficult to communicate with the Minister for Finance &ndash; to relay to the Minister the idea of including smaller villages in this scheme. One or two villages in a province or county could be chosen for special tax relief. I am thinking in particular of Ballyknockan in County Wicklow which could be a wonderful granite theme village if it were granted the appropriate tax incentive.</P>

      <P>I join other Deputies in congratulating Deputy Noonan on the thought he has given to the question of tax, including income tax and capital acquisitions tax. The proposals he has put forward regarding capital acquisitions tax which affects brothers and sisters, particularly in Dublin where residential property values have got out of hand, are equitable and fair and should be implemented by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twenty eight per cent of children in Ireland are <Col N="939" /> born outside wedlock. The way in which the income tax and social welfare systems interacts creates an incentive for some fathers not to take seriously their responsibilities to their children or to the mothers of their children. We now have the phenomenon of serial fathers who do not take seriously their responsibilities to any of their children, often by more than one mother. It is time the income tax and social welfare systems, in an integrated way, looked at how we can redress this and support families. We must take a broad view of what constitutes a family. I do not simply mean a husband and wife and children because we must take account of the many instances where marriages have broken down. However we do so, we must support families because we have created a trap which gives an incentive to some fathers to walk away and leave the taxpayers to pay the cost and these taxpayers are the fathers and mothers who are paying their way.</P>

      <P>I thank those who contributed to this debate. It is clear that the Fine Gael party sees taxation policy, not only as an instrument of social policy but of economic policy. The main policy question facing Government is how to sustain growth in the economy. The issue is sustainable growth and all policy must be measured by its contribution to that objective. Income tax policy can be used to sustain growth in our economy in circumstances where the biggest threat to growth is the shortage of workers in all sectors of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad I brought the Fine Gael tax policy before the House because this debate has illustrated the differences in our approaches. Fianna Fáil, over two years, were induced by us to put the major resources at their disposal into taking people out of the tax net and into reducing tax for the lower paid. We won that argument but the debate must go on and we ask the Government to adopt other aspects of our policy. Not only do we need a more equitable tax system and one which allows people to perceive that they are sharing in the benefits of the Celtic tiger but we must have a tax system which acts as an instrument of policy and puts people back to work. We want everyone with an income up to the minimum wage taken out of the tax net by removing the first £170 of weekly income from the tax net completely. We want an extension of the standard rate band. Other parties have committed themselves to policies along the lines of these two elements. We want a major shift from the top rate by the introduction of a new rate of 35 per cent, principally to attract extra spouses back into the work force and also so that some of the 190,000 young Irish who have expressed a wish to come home and work in Ireland will not be inhibited from doing so by a marginal rate of tax which is far too high. The Government will not achieve the objective I have in mind if it simply tinkers around with dropping a point or two from the 46 per cent rate. The real marginal rate of tax for people who earn between £14,100 and £25,000 is 52.3 per cent. That is not sustainable. People will <Col N="940" /> not return to the country with that level of taxation and the problem will not be cured by taking a couple of points off the 46 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister objected to the 35 per cent rate on the grounds that it would be too compllicated. Sometimes I believe the Minister does not understand the magnitude of the change to tax credits. This is no wonder because he never believed in tax credits and this is another policy he stole from elsewhere. Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have advocated this policy for many years and it was forced on the Minister in the ten days before the last budget. Now that we are moving to tax credits, the difficulties which would have arisen by applying an additional table allowance at the 35 per cent rate is gone. There is now not any complication in introducing a third rate and it can be strictly applied.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed by Deputy McDowell's comments last night. He accused Fine Gael of populism, of writing an imaginary cheque to its target voters and he said this was a temptation we should resist at this time. I remember studying Sheehan's <i>Apologetics and Catholic Doctrine </i>when I was in school and we learned of the eight proofs of the existence of God. The contrast between Deputy McDowell's statement and the Labour Party motion is an absolute proof of the existence of the devil. No sooner had Deputy McDowell lectured us in this Jansenistic fashion than he went on to make a proposal whose total cost would be £2.5 billion compared with the Fine Gael tax proposal which would cost £2 billion. He then committed the Labour Party to spending all surpluses on expenditure measures, tossing another £1.8 billion into the equation, and came up with a figure of commitments to expenditure either in tax reliefs or services of nearly £4.5 billion and then Deputy McDowell lectures me on giving in to temptation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell must have been taken to a high mountain and shown the wonders of the world.</P>
      <P>There is commonality between our approach and that of the Labour Party. We want to take a huge number of people out of the tax net completely by not taxing the minimum wage and we certainly want to extend the standard rate band so that the incidence of high taxation does not fall on those on middle income.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow's Book of Estimates will show that Deputy McDowell will get his wish. The Minister never stuck to 4 per cent. He always comes in with increases in expenditure between 7.5 and 8.5 per cent in real terms. At the end of next year's exercise I doubt if the outturn will be any less than an increase in expenditure of between 8 and 9 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for enabling me to raise the issue of the extension of the Luas light rail system to Bray as it is a matter of urgency in terms of decisions being made by his Department. Currently, the extension of Luas to the Cherrywood development at Loughlinstown has already been decided and made public by the Dublin Transportation Office. The DTO is considering the possibility of connecting the Luas and the DART line in the vicinity of Shankill. However, it is clear from correspondence from the DTO that all options are open for examination and assessment.</P>
      <P>The opportunity exists to extend Luas to Bray and, thereby, maximise fully the potential of light rail. It would not be the first time such a link between two public transportation systems was made at Bray. Previously the town was serviced by the old Harcourt Street line as well as the coastal rail line. Population growth in the Bray-north Wicklow area has changed dramatically since the demise of the Harcourt Street line. Already our roads are seizing up as a result of the increased car traffic. New roads, recently built, are already under pressure. Protesters are in the trees of the Glen of the Downs fighting future road expansion plans. It is becoming increasingly clear to all that simply building more roads will not solve the problem of traffic congestion in what is &ldquo;commuterland&rdquo; for thousands of people.</P>
      <P>The main artery in east Wicklow, the N11, has reached capacity and any new work to develop it will not provide for the ever-expanding need. The population growth of Wicklow has been considerable and is set to grow at an even faster rate. In a few years the population of Bray will reach 35,000 and that of Greystones will reach 22,000. Much of the new development is made up of housing, but there is an industrial and commercial element which has requirements in transportation terms. A major industrial complex is already planned close to the N11 near Bray. It is envisaged that 7,000 jobs will be created there. In the town itself multinational corporations have established enterprises that are significant employment providers, such as Dell, Lucent Technologies and Schering-Plough Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public transport links between key destinations, such as the airport, Sandyford industrial estate and Cherrywood, would have great business benefits but other important links are absent. There is no hospital in County Wicklow &ndash; the nearest is St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown, and it does not have a paediatric service. Parents with children must travel to Tallaght Hospital or Crumlin. When Harcourt Street <Col N="945" /><Col N="946" /> hospital was available to them it was at least close to major public transport links. That is no longer the case for parents of sick children who must depend on private transport to an unacceptable degree.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of work, entertainment and services, the people of Bray are poorly connected with south-west and west Dublin. Existing public transport links go back to the early to mid-19th century and are primarily radial to Dublin city centre. Conversely, the facilities in Bray are inaccessible by way of easy public transport to many in the greater Dublin area. Historically Bray has been a day-trippers destination for Dublin people. Now that the city has grown and extended westwards, it makes logical sense to ensure that there is a public transport link to and from the west of the city. The people of Tallaght, for example, should have the ease of access to the seaside enjoyed and availed of by thousands of city people travelling by DART to Bray.</P>
    <P>The DART has made an enormous improvement in public transport to and from north Wicklow, but already it is experiencing overload at peak times. Commuters nearer to town, for example, at Monkstown, are forced to use private transport because they are unable to access the DART at rush hour. When Greystones is finally opened up to the DART &ndash; perhaps the Minister of State in his reply will indicate when that new day will dawn &ndash; it will put additional load onto the service. This in turn adds further weight to the case for extending Luas to Bray.</P>
    <P>The strategic planning guidelines, which were published earlier this year, include Bray in the transportation corridor for the greater Dublin area. In this document Bray and Greystones are part of the area defined for consolidation. If extended to Bray, Luas would provide a sustainable transport option for future and existing residents. If Luas is planned now it will be relatively easy to put down the lines on the old N11 from Shankill to Bray as there is capacity on that road which would not unduly affect motorised traffic because there is little traffic on it. At the termination point of the Luas a park and ride site at the station could be provided and this would enable people travelling to Dublin from Wicklow to access Dublin by public transport. There are a number of possible routes and end points, and these should be assessed. I am glad the Minister of State, who represents County Wicklow, is taking this debate. I ask him to take on board the fact that Bray Urban District Council unanimously supported the proposals to extend Luas to Bray. I look forward to his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy McManus on raising this urgent issue. As a constituency colleague, the subject matter is close to my heart. The development of the Luas light railway project is a key priority for the Government. Significant progress has been made on the first phase of this project, with a surface line from Tal<Col N="947" /> laght to Connolly Station and a line from Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport using the old Harcourt Street and Broadstone railway alignments, with an underground section in the city centre linking these alignments, subject to technical appraisal and cost feasibility.</P>
      <P>Since that Government decision the Minister has proceeded to ensure the speedy development of the light rail network approved by Government. Particular priority has been given to the development of the Tallaght to Connolly Station and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green lines. Preliminary work has already commenced on the Tallaght to Abbey Street line and the light railway order in respect of Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green came into effect earlier this week. A public inquiry into CIE's application for a light railway order for the Abbey Street to Connolly Station line will be held in December.</P>
      <P>However, these lines represent the first phase of a longer term vision for an extended light rail network. The question of further extending the light rail network is among the matters currently being considered by the DTO as part of its work on the updating of the Dublin transport initiative strategy.</P>
      <P>Among the options for extensions identified in the Dublin Transportation Blueprint 2000-2006 is a line to Cherrywood, which is on the old Harcourt Street alignment and close to Bray. Following these evaluations, the DTO will make recommendations in relation to projects to be included in the 2000-2006 investment programme.</P>
      <P>However, the question of serving the Bray area is not limited to an extension of the Luas lines. People living and or working in the Bray area will benefit from a major investment programme on DART and suburban rail. I concur with Deputy McManus in hoping the DART difficulties will soon be corrected and that that excellent facility can be made available to the people of Greystones and further south.</P>
      <P>The first of the original order for ten DART carriages under the DART investment package will be delivered this month and a further 16 carriages which are being financed by the Exchequer and the EU will be delivered in September 2000. These 26 new carriages will be used to enhance existing services and to operate six car train sets. They will also be used to cater for the extended DART network to Malahide and Greystones. They will increase the DART fleet from 80 to 106 carriages, a 30 per cent increase in capacity.</P>
      <P>A £5 million programme over 1999 and 2000 of platform improvements for the DART and suburban rail network has been approved and the platform improvements at DART stations have already commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus of the short-term programme to be included in the national development plan over the next two to five years will be to make more intensive use of the existing rail corridors, including services to Bray, through measures such as the provision of additional rolling stock,,increas<Col N="948" /> ing train sizes to eight cars to ease overcrowding, lengthening of station platforms to accommodate longer trains, the development of new stations at suitable locations, linked to housing and industrial development and re-signalling and trackwork.</P>
    <P>The Government is working to develop and enhance public transport services. This will include the development and extension of the light railway system and the improvement of existing rail services. Together with investment in the bus service, these measures will ensure the public transport service for those commuting to and from Bray is enhanced in the coming years.</P>

      <P>Little did I think when Deputy Cecilia Keaveney and I raised the issue of the fire at the Lovell and Christmas plant on 20 June 1998 we would now raise the difficulties that would arise due to the reduction in the slaughtering and processing capacity for the northern half of the country. Overnight, due to that fire, 14% of the entire slaughtering capacity of this island was wiped out. Coupled with that was the reduction in the slaughtering and processing capacity due to the rationalisation proposals of Enterprise Ireland, formerly the IDA, in the northern half of the country. Unfortunately the crisis has deepened in the meantime. It is an issue in which all the Oireachtas members in the Border region have taken a keen interest and have worked together to achieve a solution. In the meantime there has been a continual downward spiral in prices. Even in recent weeks the average price of a pig has been reduced by £8 particularly in the Border region. Already we are facing over supply and lack of slaughtering capacity.</P>
      <P>What we are talking about is the survival of the pig sector, the pig production sector and particularly the small scale producer. The people we have met and who have made a lawful and justifiable demonstration in recent days are concerned about their future and the future of pig production. It is absolutely essential that measures are taken and financial assistance is provided urgently to ensure the sector survives. The European Union, through any competition policy, cannot block the Government providing assistance because this is not about creating an uncompetitive advantage but the survival of an important employment and farming sector. Financial assistance needs to be directed to that sector urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Farmers' Association in a detailed study and verifiable survey has estimated that in the latter half of 1998 plus the first quarter of 1999 the 88 pig producers in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan have suffered losses of more £4.5 million, taking into account the differential in the price obtainable in the south compared to the northern half of the country. Those people need assistance and have a justifiable and well presented case. We are talking about huge employment, employment on the farms and <Col N="949" /> downstream activity. It is an important employment sector in the Border region in general.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State who had the opportunity today to hear at first hand the concerns, the anxieties and the fears of pig producers, to bring to the Minister, the Minister for Finance and the Government the well-documented proposal for financial assistance to ensure this sector is given the opportunity to survive. Above all &ndash; and I wish to share time with Deputy Keaveney &ndash; I am anxious that the small scale producer is protected and that we do not have only a handful of largescale producers. That would be to the detriment of farming and the pig production sector. It is not something we could tolerate.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for allowing me share time to outline my support for a sector which I cannot believe we are still discussing a year on. As a Border Deputy in an area where many pig producers have been crippled by circumstances beyond their control I ask the Minister of State, the other Minister of State, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy to ensure the situation is resolved as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The geographical location of producers in north Donegal is difficult at the best of times. They relied on the Lovell and Christmas plant until it was burned down 18 months ago. It is discriminatory that these farmers are forced to travel many miles over many hours with their animals due to the fact that there is no premises on the Border that could take them. When animals were taken to southern plants the producers were either told they were not needed and to take them home or to accept a price that was significantly lower than that enjoyed by southern producers. This opportunistic approach crippled our producers and the list of stories of the status of the pig producer is truly staggering. The Minister of State is aware of the details of what has happened and what needs to be addressed in a regional manner and that compensation must be forthcoming in what is a once-off disaster. This will not create a precedent.</P>
      <P>In the long-term it is important that two issues be looked at: first, the over supply of animals and the reality that if some producers were made an adequate offer they might be in a position to get out of an industry that, at present, has them over a barrel and, second, the monopoly in terms of prices has to be dealt with. The Border region needs a plant that will offer competition to the producers. We are not serviced with adequate facilities. I recognise that McCarron in Cavan is operational but we need a full service.</P>
      <P>I appreciate this matter being taken on the Adjournment tonight. I cannot over stress the problem in north Donegal and in the Border region. I hope the matter which all the Oireachtas members in the Border counties, across the political divide, have been battling with for up to 18 months will be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Smith and Keaveney for raising this important matter. Deputies and Ministers, including the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Dr. McDaid, Deputy O'Halon and others have all raised this matter with me and I understand their concerns.</P>
      <P>The pigmeat market worldwide has been in difficulties over the past year or so due mainly to overproduction. In the European Union the overproduction occurred as a result of classical swine fever which necessitated the slaughter of large numbers of pigs and their withdrawal from the market. The subsequent rise in prices led producers who were not affected by the disease to increase their production. When the disease was eliminated production continued to increase and prices dropped. Other factors contributing to the difficulties were the market weaknesses in Japan and Russia which traditionally import large quantities of pigmeat.</P>
      <P>In Ireland the difficulties were compounded by the fire at the Lovell and Christmas plant in Northern Ireland which traditionally slaughtered between 5,000 and 8,000 pigs per week from the Republic. This created a backlog of pigs awaiting slaughter on pig producers' holdings in the north-eastern part of the country. The Minister, however, arranged for extra shifts to be worked at some EU approved plants as well as giving EU export approved status to an additional two pigmeat plants in Counties Meath and Westmeath. As a result the backlog was swiftly cleared. When it was suggested this time last year that there were difficulties in processing capacity we were not convinced, but the position has changed. We are now more than convinced.</P>
      <P>To alleviate the difficulties being experienced overall by Irish pig producers, the Minister took a number of important steps at EU level. With his colleagues in the Council of Agriculture Ministers he sought and obtained generous increases in export refunds from the European Commission on a number of occasions in 1998 and 1999. These increases ranged from 33 to 80 per cent. An aids to private storage scheme for pigmeat was also introduced. This scheme, which recently concluded, removed over 420,000 tonnes of pigmeat from the EU market. The European Commission also introduced a food aid programme for Russia which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. To date about 50,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been exported from the European Union under the programme to Russia. Approximately 2,000 tonnes of Irish pigmeat was placed in private storage. We hope the food aid programme, which we support, will be reintroduced in the European Union in coming months. This would help to alleviate part of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cumulative effect of the steps taken by the Minister is that prices obtained by Irish pigmeat producers increased by over 18% since the beginning of the year. There has, however, been a weakening of price in recent weeks. It <Col N="951" /> is clear, therefore, that despite the overall rise, there is a need for further improvement in prices. There was a meeting of the pig strategy group in the Department this afternoon. I accepted an invitation from members of the group to hear the views of Border farmers with whom we had a lengthy discussion. The situation in which they find themselves is dire arising from the fall in prices and the lack of slaughtering facilities. I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance and will make representations to Brussels to see what can be done to alleviate their financial difficulties. We have a valuable and viable pigmeat sector with close on four million pigs. Any losses would make it unproductive and inefficient. It accounts for only 1 per cent of pig numbers in the European Union. We have to make a strong case to protect what we have. We will look after the producers concerned if at all possible. The problems of farmers in the Border region have been highlighted, not only by Deputies Smith and Keaveney tonight but also by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Crawford.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking further measures aimed at securing an increase in prices. He recently wrote to Commissioner Fischler requesting an increase in the export refunds for Russia and an early completion of the food aid programme under which a further 50,000 tonnes of pigmeat is set for delivery. He also asked him to bring forward proposals aimed at supply control in the sector. These issues were raised by senior officials of the Department at today's meeting of the Pigmeat Management Committee in Brussels. The matter will be raised again at next week's meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday.</P>
    <P>The Minister met representatives of the feed compounders as well as the standing committee of the banks on the issue today. They gave an undertaking that no producer will experience hardship. The Minister also had recent meetings with Enterprise Ireland and An Bord Bia and asked both organisations to examine what actions they can take to assist the pigmeat sector. Enterprise Ireland was asked for an immediate assessment of slaughtering capacity and to examine aspects of the industry which may require attention and possible investment. He specifically asked that aspects of regional capacity be addressed in view of developments in the northern part of the country. This issue is being addressed, although it cannot be solved overnight.</P>
    <P>The long-term outlook for pig prices is favourable. The European Commission has forecast that the supply of pigs should drop in the last quarter of 1999. This should put upward pressure on prices. The increased demand during the Christmas season should also aid pig prices. I thank the Deputies for raising this serious mat<Col N="952" /> terwhich is being addressed. I am aware of their concern and that of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter and ask him to facilitate Deputy Gormley after I conclude as he is interested in contributing to this debate. I express my concern at a recent statutory instrument signed by the Minister for Health and Children which confines the sale of the herb St. John's Wort to prescription use from 1 January. St. John's Wort is named after St. John the Baptist and has been in common use since before his time to help with mood swings and other minor conditions. From 1 January the individuals concerned will have to obtain a prescription to get the product. It is most likely, since few doctors are familiar with the herb, that they will be given prescriptions for much stronger drugs with known side effects and addictive patterns.</P>
      <P>St. John's Wort now joins Gingko Biloba as a herb restricted to prescription in Ireland but freely available in every other country in the European Union. Gingko Biloba is another popular herb in Europe which is used to improve circulation. This comes on top of the publication by the Irish Medicines Board last June of a highly controversial document, Guide to the Definition of a Medicinal Product, which implies that vitamins, minerals and natural herbs will be classed as medicines. The guidelines are largely based on EU Directive 65/65 EEC which, as its name implies, was written in 1965, a time when we were all basking in the comfort and safety of miracle antibiotics and drugs which promised a healthy future for all. Times have changed since then and there is a massive interest in complementary medicines such as homeopathy, nutritional supplements and herbalism. There are health food shops in almost every medium sized town in Ireland &ndash; there are two in my maternal town of Bantry.</P>
      <P>The changing times have been recognised by EU regulators and at least 13 of the 15 member states are in breach of several aspects of EU Directive 65/65 EEC. At the 48th meeting of the pharmaceutical committee at DG III in Brussels last month it was unanimously agreed that there was a need to study the possibility of introducing a traditional medicines directive. Less than one week after Ireland voted in favour of considering such a directive the Minister for Health and Children made a pre-emptive strike and signed away our rights to have free access to a popular herb. While the European Union accepts that there needs to be a regulatory framework in which to deal with vitamins, minerals, herbs etc., the IMB has suddenly decided to overzealously address itself to the task of regulating these products within a framework which is entirely inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> The product Bioforce Echinaforce is known to help the immune system. Other products such as propolis, produced in the beehive, and garlic often prove effective alternatives to antibiotics. The medical profession recognises that such alternatives are urgently needed if we are to limit the current gross overprescribing of antibiotics. Sales of Bioforce products alone amount to about £1.5 million per annum at retail prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the herb as being an MAO inihibitor. There is no need to explain what this is, but current literature indicates that this is not the manner in which the herb works and this information is grossly out of date. Food supplements, including vitamins and minerals and a wide range of herbal products, have been available on free sale in Ireland for well over 20 years. Traditional herbal remedies, including St. John's Wort, have also been available for this period though their use in Ireland dates back to the beginning of our civilisation. Attempts to regulate these products by means of conventional medicinal licensing have proved totally unworkable in Ireland and throughout the rest of Europe. This is because medicinal licensing procedures were designed to assess powerful pharmaceutical drugs and are inappropriate for food supplements and gentle acting herbal products.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of consumers in Ireland and throughout the rest of Europe and the world are demanding their rights to choose safe and effective natural health products. Any restriction of this freedom to choose legitimate safe products is an infringement of the democratic rights of the consumer. It is also contrary to the EU Single Market which attempts to dismantle barriers to trade because they will continue to be available in other member states.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Health and Children to immediately withdraw St. John's Wort and gingko biloba from the prescription list and to require the Irish Medicines Board and the Department to consult in future with industry and independent professional experts on any further regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief. I thank Deputy Sheehan for sharing his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's decision to make the popular herbal supplement, St. John's Wort, available only by prescription is bizarre and inexplicable, both in its content and in its timing. There are no recorded instances of any adverse effects or interactions from St. John's Wort. It is sold freely throughout the rest of Europe and in the United States and has been sold freely over the counter in this country for many years. Yet, following a report in May by the Irish Medicines Board, the Minister last month issued a Statutory Instrument, SI 271, making St. John's Wort available only by prescription in the new year. What is the reason for that? Why is Ireland taking such an <Col N="954" /> anti-consumer stance and why is it at such variance with the rest of Europe? Why was this decision taken only a few weeks after we had agreed in the EU to seek a joint approach on the regulation of herbal medicines?</P>
    <P>At the 48th pharmaceutical committee meeting in Brussels on 27 September, all 15 EU states took the unanimous decision to explore the possibility of a traditional medicines directive. This would include herbal medicines. The Commission is now preparing proposals for next spring. This is regarded as a reasonable approach by the European Herbal Practitioners Association which sees it as both protecting the public while enabling access to plant medicines which have been in use to great benefit for thousands of years.</P>
    <P>Products such as evening primrose oil, garlic and fish oils are in danger of being outlawed by the Minister and placed under arrest by the pharmaceutical industry. Such constraint is, in reality, bad medicine. Rather than promoting healthy, preventative medicine through the free availability of health supplements and herbal products and promoting the individual's right to control his or her health, and to better understand the ingredients of good health, this decision by the Irish Medicines Board and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, will ensure a pharmaceutical monopoly on natural products. Only the pharmaceutical companies can benefit from the Minister's decisions, certainly not the 75,000 people who bought St. John's Wort in the past year or the 150 health shops and 2,000 jobs now under threat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much public interest and debate about the recent decision by the Irish Medicines Board to recommend to my Department that products containing hypericum perforatum, or St. John's Wort, should only be available on medical prescription. I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify matters. I would first like to outline the background to this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the various EU directives on prescribed medicines. It is an independent body established under the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, and is the licensing authority responsible for the grant of product authorisations for medicinal products. Following the thalidomide tragedy in the 1960s, most countries around the world introduced controls on <Col N="955" /> placing medicinal products on the market. European Council Directive 65/65/EEC defines a medicinal product as &ldquo;any substance or combination of substances for treating or preventing disease in humans or animals or which may be administered with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Irish Medicines Board published a guide to the definition of a medicinal product. This was necessary because of the significant confusion that appeared to exist in regard to what was understood by the term &ldquo;medicinal product&rdquo; in this country. This guide set out the current EU definition of a medicinal product and went on to explain the various features of the definition, drawing to some extent from the case law of the European Court of Justice. It then went on to give guidance on the basis of examples, particularly in regard to various claims that, if made, would compel classification as a medicinal product.</P>
    <P>The various categories of potential borderline products referred to in the guide included cosmetic products, foods, products with vitamins and minerals, products with selected amino acids, products with herbal ingredients, slimming products, homeopathic products, disinfectants, biocides and medical devices.</P>
    <P>The guide concerned was an updated version of a guidance note that had been published in the Department of Health and Children in 1988 and which had been widely circulated on a number of occasions. In effect, there was little new in the guide. It merely consisted of a re-statement of the position under Community law. The policy in regard to the controls in force in respect of medicinal products has not been changed by the publication of this guide by the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>As part of its normal day to day functions, the Irish Medicines Board recently carried out an evaluation in respect of a medicinal product which contained the herbal ingredient hypericum perforatum, otherwise known as St. John's Wort. In view of the claims made in respect of products containing St. John's Wort, such products are considered to be medicinal and therefore require product authorisations if they are to be lawfully placed on the market. Following the medical assessment, and in the interest of public health, the Irish Medicines Board recommended to my Department that products containing hypericum perforatum should be subject to 'prescription only' control. The reasons given by the board for its recommendation include the following: the products appear to act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, MAOIs, and as such must be used with particular care because of risks of interactions not just with other medicines, but also with certain foods. Patients, therefore, may be at risk from hypertension or increased blood pressure if these products were taken with certain other anti-depressants, over the counter cough mixtures and <Col N="956" /> with foods rich in tyramine such as cheese, yeast extract and red wine; the product may interfere with the metabolism of commonly prescribed medicines; side effects such as photosensitivity, gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and nervousness have been reported; the board was concerned about the attempted treatment of mild to moderate depression by use of an over the counter medicine. The board considers that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and advice and that self-diagnosis and self-medication are inappropriate for such a condition; and the board was also concerned at the misleading information being conveyed in the advertising and promotion of these products. Claims have been made that these products can be taken with no side effects and supported by the description &ldquo;The Sunshine Supplement&rdquo;. These descriptions are not consistent with the published scientific literature on these products.</P>
    <P>The Deputies should be aware that the decision to place a product under 'prescription only' control is carried out in the interest of protecting public health and safety and where it is considered appropriate that such products should be used only under medical supervision and advice.</P>
    <P>Some interests in the health food industry have expressed opposition to the Irish Medicines Board's attempt to complete the implementation of the various EU directives here. There is a perception that the board's guide to the definition of a medicinal product could become a threat to their involvement in the health care sector where the supply of various unlicensed &ldquo;borderline&rdquo; medicinal products is now commonplace. The impression is being created that all food supplements are under threat, and there are references to products such as garlic, ginger and fish oils, to name just a few. The suggestion is also being made that evaluation and authorisation by the Irish Medicines Board will lead to the imposition of prescription control for these products. This suggestion is false and is creating unnecessary worry in the general public, many of whom have written to me and to the Department with their concerns.</P>
    <P>The situation is quite clear. If a product placed on the market includes a medicinal claim, the product concerned becomes a medicinal product and requires a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board. Before the board may grant an authorisation, it is required to be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product concerned. Obviously, in the case of unlicensed products that may be available on the market, neither the safety, quality nor efficacy of such products would have been established by the board. I say to the manufacturers and retailers of these products that the answer lies in their own hands. They should stop making medical claims for products because once these medical claims are applied to the products, they become, under the law, medicinal products for which product authorisations are required in order that they may lawfully be placed on the market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> I assure the Deputies that it is not my intention, nor that of the Minister, to in any way interfere with the rights of individuals to avail of appropriate medicines which they may wish to use. However, it is generally accepted that in the interest of consumer health and protection, some form of regulation of alternative medicines is desirable. The European Commission is currently considering what controls, if any, should be applied in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity of raising with the Minister the need for additional caretaking facilities at St. Sylvester's national school and Pope John Paul II national school in Malahide. The schools share a caretaker under the 1978-79 scheme. However, pupil intake in both schools has increased considerably over the past 20 years. Combined, the schools cater for 972 pupils. I am aware this request will not hit the headlines in the media tomorrow morning. However, notwithstanding this, it is a very serious matter for the maintenance, safety and security of both schools.</P>
      <P>St. Sylvester's has a school-going population of 365 pupils. The school has 12 classrooms, four of which are pre-fabricated buildings situated across the school yard from the main school building. In addition, the school has two separate recreation yards. The safety of the children is a major concern, particularly as the school is situated at a main crossroads, with a resultant huge volume of traffic passing the school.</P>
      <P>Pope John Paul II school has a population of 607 children and has moved from being a three stream to a four stream school. The opening of the school each morning, for example, could take up to an hour, with over 40 doors to be opened, as it was decided a number of years ago to lock all internal doors for obvious reasons. School furniture, including audiovisual equipment, has to be distributed to all classes each morning.</P>
      <P>At present both schools share a permanent caretaker who works three days per week at Pope John Paul II school and the other two days at St. Sylvester's school. This is an entirely unsustainable situation. It is obvious that additional permanent caretaking staff are required for the proper operation of the schools, particularly in the areas of general maintenance and security. It should be noted that the part-time caretaker employed under the community employment scheme at St. Sylvester's left in September last and to date a suitable replacement has not been found. In Pope John Paul II school the community employment scheme under which two part-time caretakers are employed will come to an end in February. Furthermore, work on the extension of Pope John Paul II school is expected to commence shortly. This, in itself, will necessitate additional caretaking in the interests of safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very reasonable case has been made by the <Col N="958" /> boards of management of both schools for the provision of a full-time permanent caretaker in both schools. A good, reliable caretaker is a very important member of the staff of any school. It is difficult to visualise a school, particularly a large one, operating without a caretaker. Some of the tasks required of a caretaker are to open schools, operate the heating system, move equipment, clean, repair furniture and broken windows, provide security and so on. How can a school operate properly without a caretaker?</P>
    <P>Given the specific needs of the schools, the projected increase in the school population of the catchment area and the present economic climate, I urge the Minister to respond favourably to the request from the boards of management and to my appeal tonight on behalf of the schools, students and their parents, who are very concerned about this and want something done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently my Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. The first of these schemes, which was mentioned by Deputy Ryan, is called the provision of caretakers in national schools scheme and was introduced in 1979 as a job creation measure. The scheme's purpose is to meet the costs of salaries and employers' PRSI for caretaking staff employed in the larger primary schools. Under this scheme a number of primary schools qualified for a shared caretaker and both Pope John Paul II national school and St. Sylvester's junior national school are currently involved in a sharing arrangement. Grants covering the cost of salary and employers' PRSI are paid to the school authorities. The board of management of Pope John Paul II national school is the actual employer in this case. This scheme, which was introduced in 1979, is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant. There is no provision for the appointment of full-time caretakers in posts which are currently being shared.</P>
      <P>The second scheme for the provision of caretaking services in primary schools was introduced in 1992 as part of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP. Under the terms of the PESP, a phased programme of financial assistance by way of a supplementary capitation grant for the provision of caretaking services came into effect on 1 September 1992.</P>
      <P>Primary schools eligible for grant assistance under this scheme receive £15 per pupil per annum, subject to a maximum of £7,500, if they do not have caretaking assistance already under the existing Department's scheme for the employment of caretakers. Boards of management are responsible for making the necessary arrangements for the provision of caretaking services appropriate to the needs of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from January next, all primary schools with 100 pupils or more which do not have a service already under the 1979 scheme will be eligible for a grant of £15 per pupil per annum. <Col N="959" /> Should the existing caretaker post shared between Pope John Paul II national school and St. Sylvester's junior national school fall vacant, my Department will provide both schools with a grant of £15 per pupil per annum towards the cost <Col N="960" /> of caretaking services, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 to each school, in accordance with the current terms of the PESP scheme.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.50 p.m. until 10.30 p.m. on Thursday, 11 November 1999.</P>

      <QRef>[22706/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): It is not correct to say that the EU Commission has issued a finding that Ireland is in breach of EU excise directives.</P>
    <P>The position is that the EU Commission has issued a Reasoned Opinion, to Ireland, pursuant to Article 226 of the EC Treaty, concerning Directive 92/84/EEC on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcoholic beverages. The opinion argues that the present Irish alcohol tax regime is contrary to Article 90 of the EU treaty in that the Irish excise duty on wine is, in their view, discriminatory as a consequence of the lower excise imposed on beer.</P>
    <P>There is no guidance in the directives as to the ratios that must be applied in the taxation of alcohol. Ireland has an excise regime linked to the alcoholic strength of the product, as defined in the directives, thus aiming at, as far as possible, a fair treatment to products of comparable strength. There is nothing in the EU Directives which prevents such a basis for determining excise duty.</P>
    <P>We have responded to the Commission pointing out that Irish excise rates on alcohol broadly reflect alcoholic strength of products; the ratio between beer-wine is approximately 1:3, reflecting the relative alcoholic strength of beers and wine actually sold here; beer and wine are not in the sort of direct competition which the Commission maintain and are not marketed, distributed or sold in the same way; and that the EU Commission itself permits a zero rate of excise on wine in many member states which tax beer. This in itself is a distortion which the Commission has not acted on up to now.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Commission to decide in the light of our response whether to pursue their case under legal procedures provided for in the treaty.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware there are two elements to a SAYE scheme, an approved savings-related share option scheme and a certified contractual savings scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the share option scheme a company can grant an employee an option to purchase shares <Col N="962" /> in the company at a pre-determined price, which cannot be less than 75 of the market value of the shares. The contractual savings scheme allows the employee to save towards the cost of those shares and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have, to date, certified three separate financial institutions to hold relevant deposits under these schemes.</P>
    <P>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that to date, four companies have received formal approval to operate an SAYE scheme. In addition, 32 companies have submitted preliminary documentation to the Revenue Commissioners for consideration and these are being examined. A considerable number of telephone inquiries from companies interested in setting up an SAYE scheme have also been received by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the legislation governing the SAYE scheme was passed only in the 1999 Finance Act and that, accordingly, it may be too early at this stage to reach any conclusions on the operation of the scheme. However, I can assure the House that the position will be looked at in the context of future Finance Bills.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the decision by the Government to begin providing resources on a planned basis towards the Exchequer cost of future social welfare and public service pensions. This cost is expected to escalate over the coming decades as a result of demographic changes leading to a progressively ageing population. The Government has decided that a provision of 1 per cent of GNP should be set aside each year to pre-fund part of this prospective cost. It has also decided to allocate a major tranche of the proceeds of the Telecom flotation to supplement the annual allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decision was taken in the light of the findings of a working group which I set up in my Department to examine the implications of the ageing population. These findings <Col N="963" /> are contained in the report of the Budget Strategy for Ageing Group which was published last July. The findings of the report were based on the demographic projections contained in the Actuarial Review of Social Welfare Pensions undertaken in 1997 by the Irish Pensions Trust on behalf of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Account was also taken of actuarial studies undertaken for the Commission on public service pensions.</P>
    <P>Implementing the Government decision will require detailed legislation providing for the establishment of two statutory pension funds &ndash; a social welfare pensions reserve fund and a public service employees' pension fund. My Department is currently working on this legislation and I hope to be in a position to introduce it in the House in the new year. The legislation will define the liabilities of each fund and provide for annual Exchequer allocations to the funds to meet such liabilities. It will set out the arrangements for the administrative control and management of the funds and a general investment mandate within which this is to be exercised. Proposals have yet to be finalised on these issues. However, I would not wish to see restrictions being placed on the investment strategy to be adopted by the funds which would prevent the funds from securing the best commercial returns consistent within a prudent risk profile. Nor do I envisage my Department being involved in the day-to-day management of the funds. I have, however, already stated in public that I see considerable advantages in the NTMA having a significant role to play in the ongoing management of these funds.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will shortly introduce a Bill in the House to provide a temporary holding fund for Exchequer monies allocated in 1999 for pension funding, pending the enactment of the detailed legislation setting up the two permanent pension funds. The Bill will delegate management of the fund to the NTMA which is currently managing the short-term investment of the proceeds from the Telecom flotation. I will be seeking to have this Bill passed before the year's end.</P>

      <P>The report of the independent working group, which I established to examine the issue of the taxation of credit union savings, was presented to me in October of last year. Earlier this year I made the report publicly available. The group, which comprised officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and <Col N="964" /> an independent chairman, failed to agree on a set of findings. However, the chairman recommended that a certain amount of tax free savings for credit union members be allowed. I have received written representations from the Irish League of Credit Unions and its members, in support of the recommendations made by the chairman of the working group.</P>
      <P>When considering how best to proceed with the demands for tax free savings, including DIRT, for credit union members, one must be sensitive to the EU dimension. The EU Commission decided not to regard the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions as a State aid. I believe a key consideration, which influenced their decision, is the fact that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the Commission to the corporation tax exemption could change if dividends were exempted from income tax up to a certain limit, as recommended by the chairman of the working group. This is a point which complicates the issue and should not be overlooked by those now seeking an exemption of credit union dividends from income tax.</P>
      <P>I am fully conversant with the views of the league as they were contained in the report of the working group. Consequently, at this stage, I have no plans to meet with the Irish League of Credit Unions. The differing views within the working group reflect the complexity of this issue. I am giving this matter ongoing consideration and as yet have no proposals to amend the law in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is, I believe, referring to the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) Order, 1992. This allows for the refund of VAT in respect of qualifying medical equipment purchased through voluntary donations. The medical equipment purchased has to be approved by the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>This refund order amended an earlier scheme introduced in 1987, where only a part of the VAT paid on qualifying medical equipment purchased through voluntary donations was refunded. This refund scheme was introduced in recognition of the valuable work carried out by fund raising groups in the medical area. I am fully supportive of this valuable work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme aimed to provide relief in respect of the purchase of sophisticated and expensive items of medical equipment. It was considered <Col N="965" /> that the £20,000 threshold, exclusive of VAT, was a reasonable demarcation fine to distinguish this type of equipment from more routine items of hospital equipment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that inflation has reduced the value of the threshold in real terms since the scheme was amended in 1992. All the indications are that the scheme has worked well to date and therefore I am reluctant to make any changes at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 131 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland was one of the 11 European Union member states which adopted the single currency, the euro, with effect from 1 January 1999. Accordingly the currency of the State is the euro, and the Irish pound unit is a sub-division of it. The irrevocably fixed conversion rate between the euro and the Irish pound was set at 1 euro = 78.7564 pence.</P>
      <P>The European Central Bank enjoys complete independence in relation to monetary policy. However, the treaty provides that the Council, ECOFIN, may formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy in relation to the euro, without prejudice to the ECB's primary objective to maintain price stability. ECOFIN decided at its Luxembourg meeting in December 1997 that these general orientations would only be formulated in exceptional circumstances, but reaffirmed that they should always respect the independence of the ECB and be consistent with its primary objective to maintain price stability.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Finance, I have not commented in the past on either the Irish pound exchange rate or the euro exchange rate and I do not now propose to make any specific comment on the exchange rate of the euro &ndash; past, present or future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this country, there is no such thing as tax free Internet shopping. Given the growing economic importance of e-commerce for all business activity not least for retail sales, taxation policy requires that most transactions will be subject to taxation. It would be unfair and uncompetitive if e-commerce transactions did not attract taxes while conventional business and retail activity continued to be taxed.</P>
      <P>The current tax rules and systems, particularly VAT, are therefore applied in as far as possible to e-commerce transactions with the aim of ensuring neutrality of transactions whether carried on by e-commerce or more traditional methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do recognise that Internet shopping raises challenges for Government and may impact on the tax base. Therefore changes to the admin<Col N="967" /> istration and collection of direct and indirect taxes to preserve the tax base and ensure the effective taxation of e-commerce may be necessary. This requires co-ordinated international action and Ireland has been contributing significantly to the policy debate in the OECD and the EU on this topic. In the short-term, the most immediate concern is with VAT and a European Commission proposal in this area is possible shortly.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's suggestion about an interdepartmental study I would point out that the Revenue Commissioners published an analysis of the taxation issues in Electronic commerce and the Irish Tax System in June 1999. Given the comprehensive nature of the document, I see no</P>
    <P>need for any further interdepartmental study at this stage but will keep the matter under review.</P>

Subject to exceptions for genuine IRNR company structures involving a trading activity in Ireland and ulti<Col N="970" /> mate share ownership in an EU or a tax treaty country, all companies incorporated in Ireland on or after 11 February 1999 &ndash; the date of publication of the Finance Bill &ndash; are regarded as being resident in Ireland for tax purposes. IRNR companies which were already incorporated in Ireland before 11 February 1999 became tax resident here from 1 October 1999 &ndash; unless again they come within the exceptions referred to. This year's Finance Act also amended the information requirements for newly registered companies, made the penalty regime more effective in relation to certain non-compliance, and enabled the Revenue Commissioners to give notice to the Registrar of Companies where a company fails to provide the required information, so as to allow the Registrar to initiate strike-off proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999, which is currently on Report Stage, contains further measures aimed at discouraging the use of Irish registered companies for activities which have no connection with Ireland. For example, the Bill provides that a company will not be formed and registered unless the registrar is satisfied that the company will carry on an activity in the State. Furthermore, section 43 of the Bill will require every Irish incorporated company to have at least one director who is resident in the State or, alternatively, to provide a bond to the value of £20,000 which must be available to pay certain fines and penalties under the Companies Acts and the Taxes Acts. This requirement will apply to existing companies as and from 12 months from the date of commencement of the section.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has asked how many non-resident companies were registered in 1999. Having regard to the exceptions for genuine IRNR structures, a company's tax residence status cannot be definitively identified at the point of incorporation. Accordingly, I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the precise information requested. However, all companies will now be regarded as resident here unless they establish entitlement to these exceptions.</P>
      <P>The total number of companies incorporated in the nine months period up to the end of September 1999 was 13,975 as compared with 17,004 incorporated in the first nine months of 1998. Revenue practice is to write to companies following incorporation to determine their tax status. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they wrote to 8,397 companies incorporated in the period 11 February 1999 to August 1999 and which had not already filed the required particulars. Replies received are currently being examined. Following enactment of the Finance Act, 1999, Revenue also wrote to 38,996 companies which were incorporated prior to 11 February 1999 but which were not carrying on a trade in the State and had not registered for tax. Arrangements will be made by Revenue to notify the Registrar of Companies of those companies which fail to provide the required information so as to enable him to initiate strike-off procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> The Deputy also asked about the alleged use of agency contracts by IRNRs I am aware of a recent article in <i>Finance Dublin</i> magazine which raised this issue. I have asked my officials and the Revenue Commissioners to keep the matter under review and, if any evidence of the use of such contracts comes to light and suggests that there is any loophole in the existing legislation, I can assure the Deputy that I will bring forward appropriate further legislation to deal with it.</P>

      <P>The consultation process involved in the drawing up of the National Development Plan 2000-06 has been an extensive one. Written submissions were received from the social partners and other interests on the plan and meetings to discuss these submissions and the views of the various interests on the plan have been held at both official level and Ministerial level. In addition, the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and myself held further discussions on the plan with each of the four social partner pillars at the end of May last. In an extension of the consultation process, an overview of the draft national development plan was circulated to the social partners and meetings were subsequently held with each of the four social partner pillars at the highest political levels during which they responded to this overview. This response was generally very positive as regards the structure and priorities of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>B'iad tuairimí Bhainc Cheannais na hÉireann ar tháilli úsáid mar atá siad leagtha síos in a chuntas An Fhómhair, naoi déag nócha a naoi, ná:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A better balance between the availability and usage of public infrastructure would also seem  to require more extensive resort to the price mechanism. It may be necessary to consider more explicit charges for users of facilities in the transportation and utilities areas. This might take into account factors such as congestion and pollution that are typically not paid for by users of these facilities at present. It <Col N="972" /> would aid economic efficiency, while helping to Iimit the pressure on scarce infrastructure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sé seo ceann de roinnt tuairiscí atá tar éis táillí ar chúis thimpeallachta, agus cúiseanna eile, a mholadh. De réir mar a dhéanaimid iarracht tabhairt faoi fadhbanna caolas infrastructúir san eacnamaoícht, tárlóigh an cheist seo níos minicí ins na todhchaí.</P>
    <P>Cheana féin, tá táilli úsáidte le fáil i roinnt cásanna. I gcás bóithre tá táillí páirceála ann chomh maith le táillí ar na droichid East Link agus West Link i mBaile Átha Cliath. I gcás seirbhísí uisce, gearrtar táillí ar úsáideoirí nach de lucht teaghlaigh iad, agus tá córas nua á cheapadh chun táillí a ghearradh ar usáideoirí den chineál seo, i gcomhairle le daoine a bhfuil spéis acu ins an scéal seo. Chomh maith tá táillí le haghaidh seirbhísí bruscar in roinnt áiteanna.</P>
    <P>Scrúdóidh an Rialtas na ceisteanna a bheidh le plé i ngach cás, de réir mar a moltar táillí úsáideoirí in gcásanna eile. D'fhéadfadh sé go mbeadh rogha idir an t-infrastructúr nua a íoc as cánachas ghinearálta, nó ó tháillí a ghearrtar ar úsaideóirí nó ó dhaoine a bhainfidh leas as an infheistíocht seo. Sé buntáiste táillí díreacha ná go bhfeabhsaíonn siad éifeachtacht úsáide agus spreagann siad usáid tíosach, le maitheas don eacnamaíocht agus don timpeallacht. Caithfear na h-impleachtaí sóisialta, eacnamaíochta agus timpeallachta a chur san áireamh nuair atá cinneadh á dhéanamh ar na nithe seo.</P>
    <P>Tá modh Comhpháirtíocht Phoiblí Phríobháideach (CPP) roghnaithe ag an Rialtas ar bhonn píolótach. Leagfear an béim, i dtús báire, ar scéimeanna eacnamaíochta infrastructúir leis na príomhaidhmeanna chun luacháil mhaith a bhaint as an infheistíocht agus tosaíocht na scéimeanna ag leibhéal náisiúnta. I gcásanna áirithe, is féidir go mbeidh sé oiriúnach an infheistíocht a aisíoc ó tháillí ar úsáideoirí an infrastructúir, ag cur san áireamh buntréithe agus cuspóirí an tionscnaimh agus an príomhchuspóir luach fad-téarmach airgeadais a bhaint amach as an gcaiteachas.</P>

      <P>The expenditure projections which were included in the Stability Programme 1999-2001 published with the 1999 budget were based on adherence to the commitment in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium to limit the growth in net current expenditure to a 4 per cent annual average increase. Net current expenditure comprises net current supply services and central fund services.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that this commitment is met. In its recently published review of its An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government has confirmed that the 4 per cent limit on net current expenditure will continue to apply.</P>
      <P>The Stability Programme 1999-2000 also indicated that capital expenditure would increase by 30 per cent in 1999 and that it will increase further in subsequent years. These figures related to the increase in gross capital expenditure. On the basis of end-September figures, the corresponding gross capital expenditure outturn figure for 1999 was forecast at just over 39 per cent. The Estimates for 2000 will be published tomorrow and will show the latest forecast for voted capital expenditure in 1999.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the commitment in paragraph 5.21 of Partnership 2000 regarding a target quota of 3 per cent for employment of people with disabilities in the Public Sector.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has primary responsibility for overseeing progress in relation to this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, a monitoring committee consisting of representatives of the social partners and of Government Departments was inaugurated to oversee progress in relation to this commitment. This committee is chaired by the equal <Col N="974" /> status division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and has met four times since its inception. My Department is represented on the committee.</P>
    <P>The committee has recently issued a proposed model code of practice &ndash; based on the code of practice of the Local Authority Service, September 1999 &ndash; to all Departments and asked that it be modified as appropriate and adopted by all bodies under the aegis of each Department. My Department is currently examining this code with a view to consulting with each of the bodies under its aegis about their adoption of the code.</P>
    <P>I refer now to recruitment in the Civil Service. The Civil Service Commission recently announced an open recruitment competition for clerical officers for people who are registered with, or entitled to be registered with, the National Rehabilitation Board as having a disability.

Applicants will be facilitated by the provision of enlarged scripts, braille and audio test material, interpreters for interviews, and wheelchair access to test and interview locations. As soon as a panel of qualified candidates becomes available for appointment, each Head of Department will be encouraged to draw from that panel when recruiting clerical officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of tax written off by the Revenue Commissioners in each of the past five years is: 1994 £98.9 million; 1995 £80.5 million; 1996 £90.7 million; 1997 £281.l million; 1998 £216.7 million.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that the actual administration of the tax collection system is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners have assured me that only uncollectible tax is written off and this is done in accordance with updated general policy and procedures agreed with the Comptroller and Auditor General in 1997. I understand that the need to write off accumulated artificial estimates and amounts shown in respect of liquidated companies accounts for the increase in write off in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners' current strategy is designed to bring about an increase in timely payment of taxes and, as a result, a decrease in the accumulation of new debt. At the same time older nominal debt, which in many cases is based on unrealistic estimates from the pre-self assessment era, must be eliminated from the record so as to ensure that <Col N="975" /> resources are not wasted in the pursuing of such debt at the expense of current collection. Progress in the debt management programme is reflected in the reduction of the amount of debt from 57 per cent of net annual tax collection in 1988 to 8 per cent in 1998. The reduction is being achieved through improved case working of cases where tax is outstanding and through tougher action, including liquidation of companies, for non payment.</P>
    <P>I know the Revenue Commissioners are committed to maximising tax collection and have been very successful in doing so. Their efforts in this regard are reflected in the excellent Exchequer returns.</P>

      <P>I believe the Deputy is referring to speculation in the media regarding the imposition of rates on bed and breakfast establishments under the new Valuation Bill.</P>
      <P>A number of individuals and organisations have expressed their concern about reports that bed and breakfasts could be rated, and this has been carefully noted.</P>
      <P>The position is that it is proposed to radically overhaul the valuation system which has been in place since the middle of the last century. The Government have given approval for the preparation of legislation which will: modernise the valuation code; enable a revaluation of all rateable property to be carried out; and make the system more transparent to ratepayers and rating authorities.</P>
      <P>It is intended to make the legislation as user-friendly as possible. There will be an improved appeals system. The parliamentary draftsman is currently preparing a draft which will be brought before Government when the work is completed. A series of information seminars on the valuation aspects of the proposed legislation has been held, and of course there will be an opportunity for full debate and discussion when the Bill is published.</P>
      <P>The Government has not taken a decision on the question of rating bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>

I undertook that I would examine the capital acquisitions tax code, including inheritance tax, in detail for the forthcoming budget. This examination is currently taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that Ireland has been very active in seeking the reform and enhancement of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, which is the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's vehicle for the alleviation of the debt problem affecting many of the poorest countries in the world. Proposals were submitted by the Department of Finance during the review of this initiative which was conducted earlier in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these submissions, and in my speech to the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, I stressed that the these institutions should seek to ensure that debt relief measures take full account of the social dimension, embrace widespread consultation in the countries in question, and encourage sustainable economic development. I also argued for greater flexibility in the implementation of the HIPCs Initiative, as well as for speedier implementation, and application to as wide a range of the heavily indebted poor countries as possible. I pointed out that definitions of debt sustainability should be broadened to take human, as well as economic, development into account and that the two recent evaluations of the ESAF Facility emphasise the <Col N="978" /> need for the IMF to take full account of the social impact of policies in the design and implementation phases of macroeconomic and structural adjustment programmes. I pointed out that the most vulnerable sections of the community must be afforded special consideration, with safeguards against the most severe consequences of structural adjustment policies.</P>
    <P>Following the review of the initiative it has been substantially enhanced. The amount of debt relief on offer has been doubled and a wider range of countries is to get faster and deeper relief. While these enhancements have significantly improved the initiative, there is still room for further improvement and I made this clear in my recent speech to the annual meetings. At the same time, the enhancements which have been adopted have greatly increased the cost of the initiative and my immediate concern is to ensure that the enhanced initiative is adequately financed to allow it to be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As far as Ireland's own financial contribution to the initiative is concerned, the passage of the Bretton Woods (Amendment) Act earlier this year has allowed us to move from an advocacy role in relation to debt relief and become a direct contributor. This has given us increased moral authority to call for increased efforts by the international community to reduce the burden of debt on third world countries to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also participating in the alleviation of bilateral debt in relation to some of our priority aid countries even though our own bilateral assistance has been in the form of grants.</P>

      <P>I have attended four meetings of the ECOFIN Council since 24 June 1999. These meetings were held on 12 July, 11 September &ndash; Informal ECOFIN &ndash; 8 October and 8 November 1999.</P>
      <P>The agenda for ECOFIN on 12 July 1999 consisted of the following issues:</P>
      <P>Work Programme of the Finnish Presidency. As is customary at the start of each semester, the Presidency outlined its priorities, particularly as regards economic policy co-ordination, taxation, financial services, and economic and financial questions related to Kosovo/Western Balkans. I joined with other Ministers in welcoming the Finnish Presidency and giving my assurance that Ireland would seek to work constructively with it in achieving progress in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Elements of a Common Strategy on the Ukraine. Ministers took note of and endorsed work done by the Economic and Financial Com<Col N="979" /> mittee in preparing an ECOFIN input into the Common Strategy.</P>
    <P>Kosovo-Western Balkans. Ministers had a substantial discussion on the position as regards Kosovo and the Western Balkans in view of a meeting of the high level steering group on 13 July. Ministers agreed that the improvement of the economic situation in the Western Balkans, and in particular in Kosovo, was very important for humanitarian and political reasons, and set out a number of principles which will ensure that financial support is based on sound economic considerations.</P>
    <P>EIB Lending Mandate. Ministers reached agreement on the main elements of the new EIB Lending Mandate, including on a rate for the blanket guarantee and on global guaranteed amounts. It was agreed that the regional breakdown of amounts would require further examination.</P>
    <P>VAT: Reduced Rate on Labour Intensive Services. Ministers took note of the state of work on a Commission proposal for a directive giving member states the option of reducing the rate of VAT on certain labour intensive services on a trial basis. Discussion focused on the determination of which services would be eligible under the draft directive. Ministers requested the Committee of Permanent Representatives to present to it, by the end of July, a basis for agreement, including a list of services to which a reduced rate of VAT could be applied.</P>
    <P>Own Resources. Commissioner Liikanen gave a presentation to ECOFIN on the proposal for a new Own Resources Decision to implement the changes agreed at the Berlin European Council. The draft decision was sent for consideration by a Council working group.</P>
    <P>Implementation of OLAF. Ministers agreed a set of conclusions emphasising the importance of establishing OLAF on an operational basis, and in particular calling for the necessary steps such as the appointment of a director, the amendment of the staff regulations for the Community institutions, and other concrete measures to be taken without delay.</P>
    <P>Statistical Requirements in EMU. Ministers took note of and endorsed a progress report drawn up by the EFC on the implementation of the Report of Statistical Requirements in EMU.</P>
    <P>External representation of the Euro Area. Ministers unanimously welcomed the understanding reached with the non-European members of the G7 as regards the representation of the EU in the G7 at ministerial level on EMU issues. According to this understanding, the President of the ECB and the President of the Euro-11 Group will take part in meetings of G7 Finance Ministers when the world economic situation, multilateral surveillance and exchange rate issues are being discussed.</P>
    <P>Over lunch, the Presidency summarised discussion at the Euro-11 meeting earlier that day. Ministers took note of a presentation by the <Col N="980" /> Commission on the issue of the millennium bug and discussed the nomination of the next President of the EIB.</P>
    <P>The Informal ECOFIN took place in Turku on 11 September 1999. Informal meetings of the Council provide an opportunity for Ministers to have a general discussion on issues which will feature on the agenda of future formal Councils. As the Deputy is aware, it is not the practice for such meetings to have a formal agenda or to take formal decisions. At the meeting in Turku, we discussed a wide range of issues including economic policy co-ordination, the introduction of euro notes and coins, the year 2000 issue, and the Greek earthquake.</P>
    <P>Ministers held an informal exchange of views on economic policy coordination, focusing in particular on the key role of the broad economic policy guidelines and the structure of the macroeconomic dialogue with the Social Partners at EU level. On the introduction of euro notes and coins, Ministers held a preliminary discussion on the question of front loading, that is, whether euro notes and coins should be made available in advance of becoming legal tender on 1 January 2002, and on the length of the dual circulation period for legal tender of both national currency and euro notes and coins. Ministers took note of a progress report from the Commission on the state of play of preparations in relation to the year 2000 issue, and expressed their sympathy to Greece in view of the earthquake that it had recently suffered at that time. Other issues raised included the situation in Kosovo, financial markets questions, including a text on international financial architecture, the HIPC initiative, East Timor, the Presidency of the EIB and EIB lending to Turkey.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that Ministers discussed taxation issues at Turku in an extended</P>
    <P>Euro-11 format on 11 September 1999.</P>
    <P>The agenda for ECOFIN on 8 October 1999 consisted of the following issues:</P>
    <P>Priorities of the New Commission. Commissioners Solbes and Bolkestein outlined their priorities in the economic and financial area and the taxation area respectively. In addition to the publication of a number of regular reports, these priorities included an in-depth assessment of the broad economic policy guidelines, a communication on risk capital, a communication on the information policy relating to the introduction of euro notes and coins and, in the taxation area, progress on the taxation package, including energy taxation, as well as a study on company taxation and a dialogue with member states on VAT arrangements.</P>
    <P>Taxation Issues. Ministers reached agreement on the text of a directive allowing for a reduced rate of VAT on certain labour intensive services. As regards the draft taxation of savings directive, Ministers took note of a number of reports on the position of overseas and dependent territories of member states. Ministers agreed to convene an ad hoe meeting at political/personal representa<Col N="981" /> tive level in order to help resolve the outstanding difficulties in relation to the tax package. It was agreed that the Presidency would report to ECOFIN on 8 November on the outcome of that meeting.</P>
    <P>The State of Implementation of OLAF (European Fraud Prevention Office). Ministers adopted a number of conclusions in relation to OLAF which essentially called upon those Community institutions and bodies which had not yet put in place an appropriate framework for co-operation with OLAF to do so without delay.</P>
    <P>EIB Lending Mandate. Ministers discussed the outstanding issues in relation to the mandate and made progress as regards the breakdown into regional mandates. Some further clarification was required in relation to the final amounts before full agreement could be reached.</P>
    <P>EIB Lending to Turkey. Ministers agreed that a 600 million euro EIB facility to assist reconstruction in Turkey following the August 1999 earthquake would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Employment Package. Ministers held an orientation debate on the annual employment package, comprising the Draft Joint Employment Report 1999, proposed Guidelines for Member States' Employment Policies 2000, and Commission Recommendations for Council Recommendations on the Implementation of Member States' Employment Policies. Ministers broadly welcomed the employment guidelines and the employment report. The discussion focused principally on the appropriateness, timing and possible substance of the recommendations to be addressed to member states, with some concerns being expressed as to the procedure adopted by the Commission as regards prior consultation with member states. The issue will be studied further by the EPC in co-operation with the ELC with a view to the joint ECOFIN/Social Affairs Council on 29 November 1999.</P>
    <P>Economic Reforms. Ministers held an orientation debate on economic reforms, on the basis of a presentation by the chairman of the Economic Policy Committee. Ministers underlined the role of peer pressure in the context of country specific recommendations and indicated areas to which they attach particular importance for the further examination of progress made in economic reforms.</P>
    <P>Common Strategy of the European Union for the Mediterranean Region. Ministers agreed on the basic elements which should underpin the ECOFIN contribution to the drawing up of a common strategy for the Mediterranean region and mandated the EFC to pursue its work in this respect.</P>
    <P>Ministers met over lunch with their colleagues from the EFTA countries. The discussion focused on the challenges for macroeconomic stability for their countries after the introduction of the euro, and the urgent need to promote economic stability in the Balkans after the Kosovo crisis. Over coffee, the Presidency summarised discussions at the Euro-11 meeting held earlier that day, and <Col N="982" /> Ministers discussed the proposed Presidency visit to Moscow on 11-12 October.</P>
    <P>The agenda for ECOFIN on 8 November 1999 consisted of the following issues:</P>
    <P>Taxation Package. Ministers reviewed the state of play on the three elements of the taxation package &ndash; the savings directive, the interest and royalties directive and the code of conduct. Following a full and frank discussion, a number of difficulties remain. Ministers agreed that work be pursued in relation to the remaining areas of difficulty and that this issue be returned to at the next ECOFIN.</P>
    <P>Economic Policy Co-ordination. Ministers considered a draft report on economic policy coordination to the Helsinki European Council in December on the basis of a presentation by the chairman of the EFC which sought guidance on a number of issues. On the basis of the discussion, the EFC will finalise its draft in order to allow Ministers to approve it at the next ECOFIN.</P>
    <P>EIB Lending Mandate. Ministers discussed the outstanding issues in relation to the mandate and these were resolved on the basis of the Presidency compromise. However, one delegation maintained a reservation on the whole package, given its position on trade issues concerning South Africa, thus preventing final agreement being reached. Formal adoption will become possible once the above reservation has been lifted and the European Parliament has given its opinion.</P>
    <P>HIPC Initiative. The chairman of the EFC gave a presentation on the modalities of the proposal to make available some 1 billion euro from the European Development Fund to relieve the debt burden on heavily indebted poorer countries. On the basis of the work done, the Council concluded that the Commission could initiate discussions with the ACP countries.</P>
    <P>Introduction of Euro Notes and Coins. Ministers agreed the text of a common statement prepared by the Commission on the introduction of euro notes and coins. The statement sets out that member states will do their best to ensure that the bulk of cash transactions can be made in euro by the end of two weeks from 1 January 2002; that the length of the dual circulation period will be between four and eight weeks; that banks and retailers should be given euro notes and coins before 1 January 2002 so that there will be enough in place for circulation in the first few days of January 2002, but this must not lead to euro notes and coins leaking into circulation before 1 January 2002; and that, in order to help familiarise citizens with the new coins and to facilitate the changeover, member states can envisage making limited quantities of coins available to the public, on request, notably to vulnerable groups &ndash; but not before the second half of December 2001.</P>
    <P>Risk Capital: Implementation of the Action Plan. Ministers took note of a Commission communication on the implementation of the risk capital action plan, and requested the Commission to maintain progress in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> The Employment Package. Ministers took note of the work done by the ELC and the EPC following the discussion at ECOFIN on 8 October. It was agreed that the employment package will now be submitted to the ECOFIN/Social Affairs Council on 29 November, with a view to its adoption at the Helsinki European Council.</P>
    <P>Over lunch, the Presidency summarised discussions at the Euro-11 meeting held the previous evening and informed Ministers on the outcome of its visit to Moscow on 11-12 October. Ministers also discussed a number of other issues, including the EU Budget for 2000, Kosovo, financial markets questions, and a draft directive on electronic money.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he will take having regard to the finding of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his recent report that many self-employed and professional people have never made a tax return and that, of the 1,249 mainly professional and self-employed people against whom judgments were registered between 1990 and 1997, only ten per cent had paid a satisfactory level of arrears; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[22708/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before answering this question, I will draw the Deputy's attention to what the Comptroller and Auditor General actually stated in his recent report and the context in which the statement was made.</P>
      <P>The C&amp;AG did not report that many self-employed and professionals have never made a tax return. The C&amp;AG's report states:</P>
      <P>The profile of many tax defaulters was of individuals with their own business or classified as professionals who had been assessed to income tax. These individuals had accumulated unpaid arrears for considerably long periods (up to 10-20 years). Some, in fact, had never paid tax or never made an annual tax return.</P>
      <P>This statement was made, not in the context of the self-employed and professionals generally, but in the context of a review of a specific small group of cases. These were cases where Revenue had obtained a judgment mortgage. That said, I am sure that Deputy Gilmore would like to know what Revenue is doing about those cases referred to by the C&amp;AG and about non-filers in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the tax returns side of the question, Revenue has advised me that all non-filers are tackled as part of its ongoing compliance campaigns via letters, telephone calls and personal visits. As the Deputy may be aware, Revenue has, since the introduction of self assessment, vigorously pursued the tax return issue with the self-employed, professionals and companies. As a result, the bulk of taxpayers file their returns on time. For example, over 75 per cent of income <Col N="984" /> taxpayers file each year by the end of January filing date. The eventual filing rate is close to 98 per cent. Of the non-filers, many respond to Revenue's urging and submit their tax returns before prosecutions are instituted against them. However, these late filers incur additional tax by way of the surcharge for late submission of the tax return.</P>
    <P>Despite Revenue's best efforts to get people to submit their tax returns. there is a group who persist in their failure. Those whom Revenue refer to as habitual or persistent non-filers are being tackled through prosecution for failure to submit a tax return.</P>
    <P>Prosecution is now a regular feature of Revenue's campaign against non-filers. In 1997, Revenue obtained 311 convictions in respect of non-filing offences, last year 857 convictions were obtained and in the first half of this year, 665 convictions were obtained. This continual increase in non-filer convictions clearly indicates Revenue's intentions on the non-filing issue.</P>
    <P>To further assist Revenue in tackling non-filers, when I became aware that even after a conviction for failing to submit their tax returns, some people still did not submit those returns, I brought in an amendment in the last Finance Bill &ndash; this became section 211 (c), Finance Act, 1999, &ndash; which allows the prosecuting solicitor in non-filer cases to apply to the court for an order requiring convicted persons to submit the outstanding tax returns and this new procedure will be put into operation in the near future.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the 1,249 judgments referred to in the Deputy's question are in fact judgment mortgages. Judgment mortgages are used as a means of securing tax debts on the property of the taxpayer where the sheriff has been unable to seize assets, and the taxpayer has allowed a judgment to be registered against him/her without making any effort to pay the debt. Only a small number of cases require this approach.</P>
    <P>The sample examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General was derived from mortgages registered in the 1980s and early 1990s. In more recent years, a more focused approach to enforcement has enabled a more selective use of judgment mortgages. In the majority of cases reviewed by the C&amp;AG, the mortgage was taken on the family home as no other asset could be identified. In some cases, the possibility of a forced sale and the encumbrance of the mortgage were effective in forcing payment. However, in the majority of cases the taxpayer was unable to pay the debt and the mortgage was put in place in an attempt to secure the debt in the expectation that the taxpayer's ability to pay would improve in time. Naturally, there is a high proportion of such cases where there is an ongoing inability to pay, and forced sale of a family home is not always feasible or desirable.</P>
    <P>It is not the case that judgment mortgage cases are exempt from further and other types of enforcement. Revenue has assigned staff to sys<Col N="985" /> tematically examine these and other cases where enforcement initially failed to establish the present level of indebtedness and what further action can be taken in the light of present circumstances. This work is slow and time consuming, but is vital in order to ensure that unpaid tax is not overlooked.</P>
    <P>Revenue have acknowledged that there were deficiencies in the collection and enforcement system in operation in the past. Since the early 1990s, Revenue has progressively changed its procedures and systems for debt management. New technology has provided faster and more accurate means of identifying cases which require attention. This facilitates an earlier intervention by Revenue in cases of tax default and more focused and effective enforcement action where the intervention proves fruitless. Increased efficiency in targeting now enables Revenue to employ a wider range of enforcement measures than has been practicable in the past. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of judgment mortgages, and if necessary the forced sale of properties subject to judgment mortgages.</P>
    <P>Revenue is currently in the final stages of appointing a number of firms of solicitors to process overdue taxes through the courts. This will increase the number of solicitors employed by Revenue for this work. In keeping with Revenue's determination to pursue default to a definite conclusion, the contracts with the new solicitors will be specifically oriented towards results. The significant improvements in Revenue's internal systems, together with a very effective sheriff system, where new arrangements have applied since 1998, and the new solicitors are confidently expected to provide a swift and effective use of all legal avenues for the pursuit of default.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the Government appointed a team of consultants to prepare a report on the housing market and house prices. The Government speedily reacted to the findings of this report into house prices by Peter Bacon and Associates, and announced a number of measures aimed at addressing the sharp increase in house prices and restoring balance to the housing market. As part of these measures, I made a number of changes to the tax system and these were contained in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998. Earlier this year the Government commissioned Peter Bacon and Associates to review the effectiveness of the measures taken last year and to consider other recent developments in the housing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their second report, the consultants noted that there is widespread consensus that the <Col N="986" /> Government actions, taken last year, have played a key role in achieving a slowdown in the rate of increase in house prices. They stated that the primary impact towards price stability has been achieved through reducing investor demand, promoting liquidity in the second-hand market through the reforms of the stamp duty code and implementing a strategy to address the problem which has been credible to the market.</P>
    <P>In the 1999 Finance Act, I acted promptly on a further recommendation contained in the consultants' second report. In response to difficulties identified by the consultants, I amended the conditions attaching to the special low rate of CGT for development land, where this is sold to form part of the supply of housing land. Now, in order to avail of the low 20 per cent rate, the land need only be zoned residential under a county development plan.</P>
    <P>I have previously said that the tax measures taken last year and the further amendment to the capital gains tax code contained in this year's Finance Act were only part of an overall balanced package of ongoing measures taken by this Government. There are a number of measures which my colleagues the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal have announced in this regard. These measures, which have been discussed at length, both inside and outside this House, are aimed at increasing the supply of housing as well as improving the affordability of house purchasing.</P>
    <P>In short what could be done in the short-term under the tax code has been done and done promptly. Furthermore, tax measures have been put in place to encourage the increased supply of and for housing development to redress the imbalance between supply and demand in the housing market. Finally, it is worth noting that the Irish Permanent index published in September 1999 contains data which shows that the rise in house prices has begun to decelerate. The index states that in the first eight months of 1999, national house prices grew by 11.3 per cent as against 21.5 per cent over the same period in 1998. Also, the latest quarterly report about house prices produced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government showed that the annual rate of increase for new houses in Dublin for the second quarter of 1999 was the lowest since the last quarter of 1996 and contrasts with a peak rate of over 37 per cent in the first quarter of 1998.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that on 20 October 1998 the Government agreed in principle to the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector at the earliest date possible and agreed to the immediate establishment of an implementation advisory group to progress the necessary work. The group's report was finalised on 19 May 1999 and submitted to myself and the Tánaiste on the following day. The report, which contains a considerable number of recommendations, was published on 23 June 1999 at which time I asked that interested parties make their views known so that as much public debate as possible on this issue can take place.</P>
      <P>No decisions have yet been taken on any aspect of the group's proposals. The Tánaiste and I hope to be in a position to bring joint proposals to Government in the near future in relation to the report.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that since 1996 they have adopted a more active policy to the investigation of serious tax offences with a view to prosecution. A prosecution policy unit and three prosecution units were established in the Investigation Branch of the Chief Inspector of Taxes. This has involved specialist training in prosecution related issues with particular reference to the evidential requirements for prosecution which are very demanding. A senior officer of the DPP's office has been available to assist Revenue in this work. The DPP's office is now taking cases directly from Revenue rather than having them investigated by the Garda.</P>

    <P>Note: In another case where a sentence was imposed in 1995, the person convicted went to prison in January 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> It is, of course, normal that a small number of cases investigated are found to be unsuitable for want of evidence necessary to sustain a prosecution. In addition to six cases at present before the Courts, a further 24 cases are at various stages of investigation and other new cases under inquiry are being considered as regards possible prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also been active in the prosecution of cases where taxpayers have failed to file tax returns. In 1997, 311 persons were convicted for failure to file income tax or corporation tax returns, 857 were convicted in 1998 and in the first six months of 1999, 665 persons have been convicted.</P>

      <P>As I made clear in reply to the Private Notice Question put down last December, and has long been recognised in this House. the issue of an individual's tax affairs is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to pursue. That remains the position. However, like the other Members, I am aware from media reports at the time of the decision of the Appeal Commissioners last December in this case, and from comments made in July by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners on the occasion of the publication of the commissioners' annual report for 1998, that the decision of the Appeal Commissioners was the subject of an appeal by Revenue for a full rehearing of the case before a Circuit Court judge and that Revenue was seeking Circuit Court time for the rehearing in the current law term. Dealing solely with this question of timing, the commissioners have informed me that it was not possible to obtain the time required in the present law term but that arrangements are being made to have the case reheard as early as possible next year.</P>

      <P>Any measures which I introduce in my budget on 1 December next will not have the effect of increasing poverty. I am not going to give any further details of budget 2000 at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the 1999 budget, an assessment of the impact on poverty of the tax changes was carried out with the assistance of the ESRI's SWITCH model, analysis provided by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department's own analysis of the impact of the tax package on disposable income. This exercise assessed the tax <Col N="993" /> changes by reference to questions set out in the guidelines for poverty proofing prepared by the NAPS unit of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. I have arranged for the outcome of this exercise to be placed in the library of the House and for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In relation to expenditure measures, the responsibility for poverty proofing lies with the spending department. For budget 1999, poverty proofing exercises would have been carried out in the relevant Departments on expenditure items before they were put forward as proposals for inclusion in budget 1999.</P>
    <P>A formal poverty proofing exercise was not carried out on the taxation measures introduced in budget 1998, as the formal arrangements for poverty proofing were not introduced until after the Government decision of 1 July 1998 &ndash; seven months after the budget. Nonetheless, that budget had a positive impact on poverty through the increases in the basic personal allowances, the restriction in the standard rate of tax, the increase in the PRSI weekly allowance and the increases in the exemption limits. The budget also announced a special initiative to assist the long-term unemployed back to work, consisting of a tax allowance of £3,000 for the employee, tapered down over three years and a double tax deduction for wages for employers who take on the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>In my statement on the end-September Exchequer returns, I indicated that Exchequer issues for net current voted expenditure to the end of September 1999 had increased by 8.8 per cent over the same period last year. This compared with a <Col N="995" /> budget target increase of 10 per cent. The 10 per cent budget target increase in net current voted expenditure was consistent with the Government's commitment to limit the increase in total net current spending to 4 per cent per annum on average. Total net current spending comprises net voted current expenditure and central fund services.</P>
      <P>The end-October Exchequer statement indicated that a current and capital breakdown of voted expenditure is available only at the end of each quarter. However, my Department tentatively estimates that the increase in net voted current expenditure at end-October 1999 over the same period in 1998 was 9.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>In my end-September statement, I indicated that there are continuing pressures on current spending in certain areas such as pay, health, education and agriculture. These are partially offset by savings on social welfare and other spending. I said that, on present trends it is expected that net current voted expenditure will be over £100 million above the budget target at the end of the year, although further savings may emerge later in the year. An excess of £100 million over budget as forecast at end-September would imply an increase in net voted current expenditure of 11 per cent in 1999 over 1998 compared with a budget target of 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for 2000 will be published tomorrow and will show the latest forecast for voted current expenditure in 1999.</P>

      <P>There has been intensive consultation with regional interests in the formulation of the national development plan. The Government invited and received submissions from the eight NUTS III regional authorities and the Western Development Commission on the priorities which should govern the plan. Pending the establishment of the two new NUTS II regional assemblies, the Government also invited the constituent regional authorities within each of the new regions to prepare proposals on plan priorities for their region. In response, two very comprehensive reports were prepared by Fitzpatrick Associates which were endorsed by the two regions and submitted by them to the Government.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, I met separately with delegations representing both the existing. NUTS III regional authorities and the new NUTS II regional assemblies, following the latters' inaugural meetings in early October. In advance of these meetings, I transmitted to the delegations, as a basis for the discussion, an overview of the draft NDP. This overview set out in some detail, and on a regional basis, the proposed priorities, structure and indicative financial allocations in the plan. At the meetings, the responses to the overview were positive. There was also a welcome for the level of consultation with the regional authorities, although the limitations on the assemblies' involvement was acknowledged, given their very recent establishment and the EU deadline for submission of the plan. However, in this context, it should be noted that the members of the regional assemblies are also members of the constituent regional authorities within the two regions.</P>
      <P>This part of the consultative process has now concluded and I am confident that the plan will be seen to have responded to the priorities of the two regions. The plan itself will be published on 15 November next and submitted to the EU Commission. I would, however, point out that, consistent with the relevant EU regulations, it is the Government which is responsible for the formulation of the national development plan, having taken account of all representations made to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay a particular tribute to the very constructive role played by the regional authorities and assemblies <Col N="998" /> in the consultation process on the plan. In my view, a sound basis for future co-operation between central Government and the regional institutions has been established.</P>

      <P>The National Treasury Management Agency was established under the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990, to borrow money for the Exchequer and to manage the national debt. No change in this role is envisaged.</P>
      <P>I have considered proposals which would entail assignment to the NTMA of new functions in areas in which the agency's experience and expertise can be used to good effect. Last year, responsibility was assigned to the agency for the management of part of the FEOGA related debt and the transfer of the remaining FEOGA debt to the agency will be completed in December of this year. Furthermore, it is envisaged that, next year, the agency will assume the debt of Nitrigin Eireann Teoranta and manage it as part of its debt portfolio.</P>
      <P>In July of this year proposals were announced which will substantially extend the role of the NTMA by providing for the establishment of a State claims agency and a central treasury service enabling the NTMA to provide a fund management service.</P>
      <P>The State claims the agency will enable the NTMA to handle certain common law compensation claims against the State and to provide advice on risk management. The main benefits expected from the setting up of the agency are savings in settlement costs, legal charges and, through its risk advice role, a reduction in the incidence of claims.</P>
      <P>The central treasury service will enable the agency to offer advisory and cash management services, including deposit, overdraft and loan facilities to health boards, vocational education committees, local authorities and other designated public sector bodies. The proposals also envisage allowing the NTMA to provide, where such a service is required, a formal investment management role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard I would mention the Government's decision, announced some months ago, to establish future pension liability reserve funds, financed initially by part of proceeds of the Telecom IPO and an amount equivalent to 1 per cent of GNP annually. Pending the completion of legislation establishing these funds, the NTMA is currently managing on behalf of the Exchequer the short-term investment of these funds. The arrangements for the longer-term investment and management of these funds are under active discussion at present. I have, however, already <Col N="999" /> stated in public that I see considerable advantages in the NTMA having a significant role to play in the ongoing management of these reserve funds. The necessary legislation to enable the NTMA to carry out new functions is being drafted at present and I would hope that it will be possible to have it published by early next year.</P>
    <P>I will shortly introduce a Bill in the House to provide a temporary holding fund for Exchequer moneys allocated in 1999 for pension funding, pending the enactment of detailed legislation establishing the funds themselves. It is envisaged that the NTMA will manage the temporary holding fund; the agency is already managing the moneys which will be transferred to the fund as part of its general management of the Exchequer. I will seek to have this Bill passed before the year end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 to 78, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of insurance is primarily related to insurance claims experience. The relatively high cost of insurance for young drivers is directly related to their adverse claims experience, as a risk category. The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report <Col N="1001" /> on an economic evaluation of insurance costs found, that the average cost of an insurance claim, for 17-24 year old drivers, is twice that for the 36 to 40 age group and that motorists in the 17-24 age group, are responsible for over 3.5 times the total average claims costs, incurred for motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.</P>
    <P>Motor insurance premia are normally based on underwriting experience, including trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims, for particular risks and classes of risk and are a matter of judgment by individual private insurance companies. Any changes in circumstances affecting the risk insured would have to be assessed by the insurer from an underwriting standpoint. The premia charged and the availability of a quote, will reflect any material increase in the risk.</P>
    <P>The previous motor insurance advisory board survey of 1993, found that under both comprehensive and non-comprehensive cover, the frequency and cost of the 17-24 age group, was significantly higher than in the higher age categories.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that the primary focus of initiatives, aimed at reducing the cost of motor insurance, must be on reducing the frequency of accidents and the associated cost of claims. The key, therefore, to reducing insurance costs for young drivers is to create appropriate conditions for improving their standards of driving and their appreciation of road safety.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness, among all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors' register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students. I have also exhorted our colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to expedite his Department's examination of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers based on the Ontario model which, I believe, could have a significant impact if introduced here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>My re-establishment of a much re-vamped motor insurance advisory board, was a major initiative, aimed at providing us with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The expanded membership of the new board, which includes a member representing young drivers' interests, is broadly representative of all of the interests concerned including road safety and enforcement experts.</P>
    <P>There is clearly no soft option for reducing motor insurance premia for young inexperienced drivers, including those on provisional licences. As a group, they represent a very high risk for insurers and many insurance companies are reluc<Col N="1002" /> tant to quote for that risk. As in any other branch of insurance risk, reductions in premia can only be achieved by improved safety standards. In the case of young Irish motorists, the inculcation of safer driving standards, education in driving skills and the early acquisition of a driving licence, is the key to reducing their high accident rate which, in turn, should lead to lower premium quotations.</P>

      <P>Indications of the state of euro-readiness of Irish firms have been ascertained from a series of four surveys, beginning with a benchmark study in July 1997, followed by surveys in March 1998, December 1998 and July 1999 that have been conducted as part of the EMU Business Awareness Campaign, which is managed on behalf of the Government by Forfás.</P>
      <P>The results across each of the four surveys indicate that firms have been making good progress with regard to basic preparations since the first survey was conducted in July 1997; 55 per cent of all firms have now worked out the strategic implications of EMU up from 43 per cent in the December 1998 survey and 18 per cent in the benchmark survey in July 1997; 69 per cent of firms have worked out the practical implications for the changeover, an increase from 60 per cent in the December 1998 survey and 8 per cent in the benchmark survey in July 1997.</P>
      <P>In line with previous studies, the fourth survey shows that larger companies continue to be more advanced in their overall levels of basic preparation than small and medium sized firms. The findings also clearly show that SME firms have been making steady progress with their preparations since the benchmark survey was conducted, albeit at a slower rate than larger companies.</P>
      <P>The levels of business preparedness for the initiation of the euro currency on 1 January 2002 are generally satisfactory having regard to the fact that the introduction of euro notes and coins is still more than two years on.</P>

      <P>Romania acceded to the Council of Europe in <Col N="1004" /> 1993. As a member state of the council, Romania undertook to accept the standards of the organisation, in particular, democratic values, the principles of the rule of law and the protection of humans rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>Romania is also a party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the provisions of which, <i>inter-alia,</i> provide protection for persons from unjust persecution.</P>
      <P>Each Council of Europe member state is responsible for honouring these commitments, with the assistance of the relevant bodies of the organisation &ndash; in particular the Committee of Ministers, the Parliamentary Assembly, the European Court of Human Rights and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. It is considered that Romania has made considerable progress towards the fulfilment of its obligations and commitments to the Council of Europe and continues to take steps to improve the functioning of democracy, respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights. The Council has welcomed, in particular, Romania's willingness to take appropriate measures to combat problems of intolerance and discrimination, particularly against minority groups. According to the 1998 report on Romania by the COE's European Commission on Racism and Intolerance problems of intolerance and manifestations of racism persist, particularly as regards discrimination and violence against members of the Roma gypsy community.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, there are now 41 member states of the Council of Europe, all of whom are expected to fully honour the standards and values of the organisation, including respect of political freedoms. Ireland holds the chair of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe as from the beginning of November 1999 until the end of May 2000. The organisation continues to monitor and to assist its newer democratic member states to fulfil their obligations in this regard. Full respect for democratic values, including political freedoms, is also a key requirement expected of those European states whose applications to join the Council are currently being considered.</P>

      <P>Subject to the successful completion of these negotiations, I expect that a contract will be concluded shortly and that the first vehicles will be delivered to the Defence Forces towards the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The possibility of accelerating production to achieve full delivery of the remainder of the vehicles as early as possible will be explored in negotiations with the supplier.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated to the House on previous occasions, the question of the appointment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces has been raised by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force. The terms of the scheme, which have been agreed with the association, provide that discussions at conciliation and arbitration are confidential to the parties involved. Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue.</P>
      <P>Revised complaints procedures for the Defence Forces were agreed with PDFORRA and RACO and implemented with effect from May 1996. The revised procedures provide for the appointment of an independent complaints inquiry officer to investigate grievances on behalf of the Minister. All complaints, other than the most trivial or vexatious, are referred to him by the Minister. The agreement also provided that the revised complaints procedures should operate on a trial basis for two years, after which a review of the procedures should take place. This review is now being undertaken by subcommittees of the conciliation council established for that purpose. I have no wish to interfere in their deliberations but I will say that it is vital that all members of the Defence Forces have confidence in the outcome of that review. It should be possible to create a procedural formula for dealing with grievances that satisfies all concerned and at the same time maintains the ethos of the military way of life.</P>

This has led to some on-site visits-inspections by potential investors but it remains premature to speculate whether these will result in definitive plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the closure of the facility, which has not been sold, has impacted negatively on vegetable growers in the area. The issue of their alternative production or supply arrangements is, however, one for the individual growers. I will seek to ensure, however, that to the extent possible their <Col N="1013" /> interests are borne in mind in pursuing an alternative enterprise at the Midleton site.</P>

However two cows, eartag numbers HZA742324 and MAX040696, which had been listed on his application form, were found at an inspection on 15 July 1999 to have been retagged with numbers HAB283525 and HAB283536 respectively, on 18 May 1999, that is, prior to application. Under clause 13 of the 1999 cattle headage terms and conditions and clause 15 of the 1999 suckler cow premium scheme terms and conditions, which state that each animal's tag number must be entered accurately on the application, the retagged animals were rejected for payment.

My Department is at present preparing an integrated rural development plan with a view to implementing the new regulation. The terms and conditions which will apply to the future early retirement scheme are being considered at present in the context of that plan.</P>
      <P>I expect my Department's proposals for the integrated rural development plan to be submitted to the European Commission before the end of the year.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the EU headage and premium schemes are concerned the position is that, since the CAP reform arrangements were introduced in 1992, restrictions are in place in a number of EU funded schemes which limit the size of the claim or restricts eligibility to certain categories of farmer. These limits and restrictions arise from policy decisions within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>Effectively this requires that the Department must satisfy itself that where new holdings are created after 30 June 1992, they are in fact legitimate entities managed separately from existing holdings and that holdings which existed prior to 30 June 1992 are not split into two or more holdings with the sole purpose of avoiding individual limits on eligibility for premiums. Each case is decided on its merits and the deciding factors are similar to those for REPS. Where a farmer is dissatisfied with a decision there is provision for review and appeal.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of the REP scheme operators of farms sharing some or all of the following characteristics &ndash; farm ownership and management, farm dwellings, herd numbers, IACS returns, farm accounts or tax returns &ndash; are deemed to be farming as one unit unless evidence is provided to the contrary.</P>
      <P>Each case is examined on its own merits. The matter may be further investigated in an onfarm inspection which examines,<i> inter alia</i>, factors including mixing of animals, facilities for handling and wintering stock, farm boundaries and area aid applications.</P>
      <P>Following this investigation the inspector forms an opinion whether the land is farmed as one unit or otherwise. Matters arising from the investigation relevant to the case will be considered formally at headquarters. A decision is made based on the inspector's report and an examination of relevant documentation.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for a flock number in September 1998 and submitted an application for ewe premium and sheep headage in January 1999. Normal procedure up to now has been to process applications for flock numbers when new applicants are being inspected for ewe premium and sheep headage. The applicant's flock in this case was inspected on 15 April 1999 following which his eligibility for sheep headage was brought into question. To be eligible for headage an applicant must, <i>inter alia, </i>be resident within 70 miles of his disadvantaged areas land. The applicant was informed that as he was resident in Dublin he would not qualify for headage. It also transpired that the person named had applied to join REPS. As his eligibility under REPS has not been established the processing of his application for a flock number was delayed. However a decision in relation to his eligibility for a flock number will be made very soon.</P>

      <P>An appeal on behalf of the person named, who is a participant in REPS, has been submitted to my Department. The case was considered by the REPS appeals committee on 3 November 1999. The committee noted however that the case involved the eligibility of lands under the REPS regulations rather than the imposition of specific penalties for non-compliance.</P>
      <P>The matter was deemed not appropriate to the appeals committee as the case involves an administrative recoupment of moneys paid out in respect of land which the applicant was not farming and had let to another party. The land in question would be ineligible under the scheme regulations which clearly set out the eligibility criteria and the procedures to be followed in such cases. The case is being followed up within my Department and the person named is being informed directly of the outcome.</P>

      <P>I am fully supportive of the efforts being made by the draimeann and Endangered Cattle Society to re-establish the draimeann breed of cattle in the south-west of Ireland. In 1998 a cattle breeding expert from my Department visited members of the society to assess the draimeann cattle and to offer advice <Col N="1018" /> on possible strategies which they might pursue to achieve their objective of re-establishing these cattle as a breed. However, draimeann cattle are now genetically very heterogeneous in the sense that crossbreeds of many breeds have been introduced and it would take considerable time and effort before the population could become recognised as a breed.</P>
      <P>On the question of collecting semen from bulls of draimeann type, this would not be advisable from an animal breeding perspective until it was established that such bulls would breed true to the type defined as draimeann. This could only be established by repeatedly selecting animals of the desired phenotype over a number of generations of breeding.</P>

      <P>Glacaim leis go bhfuil an Teachta ag tagairt don phinsean baintrí agus do na breiseanna i gcás páistí a chuireann an Roinn Gnóthaí Sóisialacha, Pobail agus Teaghlaigh ar fáil. Bíonn an pinsean seo áiríthe mar ioncaim ó thaobh cúrsaí cánach de, faoi mar atá formhór na n-íocaíochtaí leasa shóisialaigh eile. Áirítear agus áiríodh i gcónaí breiseanna i gcás páistí leis an phinsean baintrí mar ioncaim an tuismitheora agus mar sin bíonn sé san áireamh ó thaobh cúrsaí cánach de. Mar sin féin, braitheann an méid cánach a thiocfaidh i gceist i gcás áirithe ar bith ar an mhéid ioncaim eile a bheidh ag baintreach sa bhliain chánach céanna. Mura mbíonn aon ioncaim breise ann is féidir a bheith ag súil go gcinnteoidh na teorainneacha díolúine agus na liúntais nach mbeidh cáin ar bith le híoc ar an ioncaim leasa shóisialaigh féin. Is prionsabal ginearálta cánach é, go náirítear ioncaim ó gach foinse ó thaobh cúrsaí cánach de agus glacaimse leis mar sin nár chóir na híocaíochtaí a bhfuil tagairt déanta ag an Teachta dóibh a bheith difriúil ó ioncaim de chinéal ar bith eile.</P>
      <P>Cé go bhfuil an prionsabal ginearálta maidir le cáin a ghearradh ar ioncaim ó gach foinse leagtha síos agam anseo, tá mé sásta stáid airgeadais na mbaintreach tuismitheora a aithint. Beidh a fhios ag an Teachta go n-aithníonn an cód cánach na toscaí speisialta a bhaineann le bhaintreacha tuismitheora agus go gcuirtear liúntais fhlaithiúla pearsanta ar fáil dá réir. Beidh cuimhne ag an Teachta chomh maith gur chuir mé méadaithe an-suntasach ar fáil i mo chéad cháinaisnéis maidir leis an liúntas báis do bhaintreacha tuismitheora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoin gcód, bíonn baintreacha tuismitheora i dteideal liúntas baintrí de £500 agus liúntas bhaintreacha tuismitheora de £3,700 chomh maith leis an liúntas ÍMAT (Íoc Mar A Thuillir) agus liúntas pearsanta do dhuine singil. Tugann siad seo liúntas comhcheangailte de £9,400 do bhaintreacha tuismitheora, is é sin, an liúntas céanna a fhaigheann cúpla pósta (tá £3,150 den mhéid seo ceadaithe don cháiníocóir ag an ráta imeallach cánach.) Sa bhliain ina bhfaigheann an duine bás, tá an cháin a ghearrtar ar bhaintreacha ar a laghad chomh fabhrúil leis an cháin a ghearrtar ar chúpla pósta, leis an liúntas pósta agus ráta bandaí dúbáilte fós i gceist. Aithnín go bhfuil deachrachtaí áirithe in sna blíanta i ndiadh blían an bháis agus da bhrí seo, tá an bhaintreach tuismitheora i dteideal liúntas báis a fháil chomh maith. I gcáinaisnéis na bliana 1998, mhéadaigh <Col N="1020" /> mé an liúntas seo ó £1,500 go dtí £5,000 agus leathnaigh mé an tréimhse ina mbarrchaolaítear an liúntas ó thrí bliana go dtí cúig bliana.</P>
    <P>Sa chás go mbíonn morgáiste fágtha le híoc ag baintreach, tá soláthar déanta sa chód cháin ioncaim a cheadaíonn do bhaintreach ús a éileamh suas go dtí £3,600. Is é an mhéid inchomparáide do dhuine singil nó £2,500. B'fhéidir gur mhath leisan Teadta a nótáil chomh maith nach ngearrtar an taobhach sláinte de 2 fán gcéad ar aon chuid d'ioncaim an té a bhfuil pinsean baintrí leasa shóisialaigh á fháil aige/aici.</P>
    <P>Tá tairbhe bainte ag baintreacha, mar atá ag cáiníocóirí eile as na feabhsaithe ginearálta cánach atá tugtha isteach sa dá cháinaisnéis dheireanach. Ina measc sin tá na hardaithe atá déanta ar na liúntais phearsanta agus ar na liúntas ÍMÁT agus an caighdeánú atá déanta ar na liúntais seo. Tá leathnú déanta ar an mbanda cánach chaighdeánach agus tá laghdú de 2 fán gcéad déanta ar na rátaí cánach caighdeánach agus árd. Cinntíonn na beartais seo maraon leis na beartais faoi leith atá mínithe thuas, sa chás go dtarlaíonn sé ar chor ar bith, go bhfuil laghdú suntasach tagtha ar dhliteanas cánach do bhaintreacha le dhá bhliain anuas.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 2 November about a report commissioned by the European Retail Round Table and EuroCommerce. It seems clear that the report is not in fact proposing that euro notes and coins be put into circulation in advance of 1 January 2002, but rather that they be made available to the public before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 105a of the treaty on European Union, the European Central Bank has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of euro notes. As regards euro coins, on 8 November ECOFIN, the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers, issued a statement indicating among other things that making limited quantities of coins available to the public before 1 January 2002 can be envisaged, but not before the second half of December 2001. Clearly, however, the focus must be on putting in place the arrangements necessary to make the changeover commencing from 1 January 2002 work satisfactorily. In this context, the ECOFIN statement pointed out that, to provide for a sufficient quantity of euro coins for circulation in the first days of January 2002, it would be helpful if financial institutions and certain other groups, notably cash in transit companies and retailers, were already provided with notes and coins some time before 1 January 2002, but recalled that such frontloading <Col N="1021" /> must not lead to putting euro banknotes and coins into circulation before 1 January 2002.</P>

      <P>This section was first introduced with effect from 5 April 1982. It provides that Revenue must make a determination that reasonable access is afforded for the public to a building or garden which is of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest. Revenue have advised me that a total of 121 determinations in relation to reasonable access has been made since that date. As records are not available for the earlier years, it is not possible to state the exact number of those 121 taxpayers who have claimed the relief or the exact value of such claims in all years. However, based on a survey done some years ago, the cost of the claims in the years since 1982 is estimated at £3.7 million.</P>
      <P>Revenue have further advised me that they have recently initiated a programme to upgrade their statistical coverage in relation to section 482. The first tranche of new statistical data under this programme will be available shortly and will include the details requested by the Deputy for the tax years 1997-98 back to 1995-96. I will write to the Deputy with this information as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In December 1998 the Vienna European Council called for agreement to be reached on a tax package by the Helsinki European Council in December 1999. This commitment was reaf<Col N="1022" /> firmed at the Cologne Summit in June 1999. The three key items of the tax package are (i) a code of conduct on business taxation, (ii) proposals for a directive on the taxation of income from savings, and (iii) proposals for a directive on the taxation of interest and royalty payments between companies.</P>
      <P>Discussions are continuing on the tax package with a view to meeting the deadline for a report of the Helsinki European Council, however there are still outstanding items.</P>
      <P>Improving tax policy co-ordination in the EU, which Ireland supports, is not to be confused with harmonisation of tax rates which is not on the EU agenda. This was confirmed at the Vienna European Council, the agreed conclusions of which stated that &ldquo;co-operation in the tax policy area is not aiming at uniform tax rates and is not inconsistent with fair tax competition, but is called for to reduce the continuing distortions in the single market, to prevent excessive losses of tax revenue or to get tax structures to develop in a more employment-friendly way&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Finally, with regard to the Deputy's question on vehicle registration tax, I am not aware of any harmonisation proposals at EU level in this regard nor are there any proposals from Ireland in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland &ndash; ECBI &ndash; has the task of providing information on the euro to the public. Since I established it in May 1998, the ECBI has been carrying out an extensive public information programme on the euro and a detailed account of its activities is contained in its first annual report, which was published in June 1999. Among many other items, the board's public information activities have included distributing over 4.5 million information leaflets, including one to every household in summer 1998 and a second in spring 1999, and some half a million paper converters; circulating over 200,000 posters for display in schools, libraries, public offices etc; running three advertising campaigns on the euro; running a regional information roadshow in spring 1999, which visited thirteen cities and towns around the country, co-sponsoring a national television series on the euro, and setting up a website (www.irlgov.ie/ecbi-euro), Aertel page (page 678) and local helpline (1890 20 10 50).</P>
      <P>In addition, the EMU business awareness campaign being run by Forfás on behalf of the Government has distributed large quantities of its extensive information materials for business and many private sector organisations promote information about the euro among their members.</P>
      <P>In June 1999 the ECBI published the results of a national survey of public awareness on the euro. The survey's main findings were that 88 per cent of the population knew the name of the euro &ndash; 59 per cent in 1998; 75 per cent had seen, read or heard something about the euro; 53 per cent were in the right value zone for the euro, at 78.80p; and 48 per cent knew that euro notes and coins will come into circulation in 2002 &ndash; 21 per cent in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These results showed a good general awareness <Col N="1024" /> of the euro, especially when account is taken of the fact that euro notes and coins will not be put into circulation until 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>Arising from the survey, the ECBI's activities are focused on two areas: first, helping people to develop a scale of values for themselves in euro, and secondly, targeting people with lower-than-average awareness on the euro &ndash; essentially, elderly people and people not in the workplace.</P>
    <P>As regards the first, the ECBI ran two outdoor poster campaigns during the summer focusing on a number of common money amounts and their equivalent in euro, and is working with the Forfás business campaign in an effort to promote dual display, that is, in euro as well as in Irish pounds, of net pay on payslips. Dual display is in widespread use otherwise, of course, for example on national lottery tickets, on bills from the ESB, An Bord Gais and Eircom, on tax-free allowance certificates from the Revenue Commissioners, on bank statements, till receipts etc.</P>
    <P>As regards the second, the ECBI's current information activities include the following: a poster has been produced and circulated for display in all post offices and social welfare offices giving basic information on the euro and inviting further inquiries; an information pack, including an information video, is being sent to some 1,000 nursing homes and day-care centres for elderly people; following consultation with organisations involved with literacy, an information pack will be circulated to special schools and bodies concerned with literacy, and a special information leaflet and a workbook for literacy tutors will be provided for use with people who have literacy difficulties; in the ECBI's programme for 1999-2000 of part-funding for information activities on the euro carried out by non-governmental organisations, special priority is being given to activities focusing on low awareness groups.</P>
    <P>Finally, in early October the ECBI launched a new website for schools, linked to Scoilnet, and has since sent an information pack about it to all primary and post-primary schools, some 4,000 in all. The ECBI is also collaborating with the Department of Education and Science on the preparation of subject guides on the euro for teachers.</P>
    <P>The ECBI will continue to provide public information on the euro until the changeover is complete in 2002.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the study carried out for the French Government (details supplied) which estimates that legal and illegal drugs represent a cost to the economy of 2.42 per cent and 0.16 per cent of GDP respectively; and if he will have a similar study undertaken here with particular reference to alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that this study was carried out by Professor Pierre Kopp of the Sorbonne in France, in collaboration with a panel of experts, for the French office on drugs and a special ministerial mission on the impact of legal and illegal substances. It deals with the social cost of consumption of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. The panel of experts found that the abuse of alcohol presented the most serious problem followed by tobacco and then illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>Estimating the economic cost of alcohol related problems is fraught with difficulties due to the problems of gathering accurate data on true costs and the exclusion of other social costs, such as quality of life, the pain and misery suffered, which cannot be adequately quantified. In the case of Ireland, quantifiable costs for some of the measures were estimated in 1980 and again in 1992 both using similar criteria, including, for example, workplace production losses due to absenteeism, illness and accidents attributed to alcohol, losses from road accidents and numerous other areas. The most recent estimated costs available are based on 1988 estimates. However, the national alcohol surveillance project which was set up by the Health Promotion Unit of my Department following the publication of the national alcohol policy in 1996 is currently examining the information available with a view to updating the estimated costs. I understand these will be available next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to tobacco I have agreed to support the development of an information and resource centre for tobacco and health. This centre when operational will be a valuable source of information on all aspects of tobacco, tobacco technologies, marketing practices, tobacco law and the economics of the tobacco industry. A project team was established by ASH Ireland to oversee the development of the centre and will <Col N="1026" /> be submitting its proposals to my Department by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In relation to drug misuse, Ireland is participating in activities being co-ordinated by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction &ndash; EMCDDA &ndash; on estimating the amount of public spending on drugs. This would include the cost of policing, customs, justice, custodial institutions, health and social services, prevention and research and action at international level. The EMCDDA, in conjunction with member states are trying to agree a common set of criteria on which to measure spending on a comparable basis and I am sure that the study conducted by Dr. Kopp will contribute to this debate.</P>
    <P>In addition, the interim advisory group on drugs, which has been established under the aegis of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs has listed research into the cost of illegal drug misuse as a priority for attention.</P>

    <P>There are no statistics available on the numbers of people with physical and sensory disabilities. However, based on the average incidence in other countries, it has been variously estimated that the numbers of people in Ireland with these disabilities could be between 100,000 and 200,000.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December, 1996, highlighted the lack of reliable information on the numbers of people with physical and sensory disabilities and recommended the establishment of a database of the service needs of this group. Following successful pilot projects in three health board areas and in line with the recommendations of Towards an Independent Future, a National Database Development Committee was established and hopes to complete its work by the end of this year. This will enable steps to be taken next year to put the database in place.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the decision by the Irish Medicines Board to list the herbal remedy St. John's Wort for prescription only; if it will be available under the general medical services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland. EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC defines a medicinal product as any substance or combination of substances for treating or preventing disease in humans or animals or which may be administered with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions. The directive does not make any distinction between conven<Col N="1030" /> tional medicines and those medicinal products containing ingredients which may be described as &lsquo;natural' or &lsquo;herbal'.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board, in its recent guidelines on the interpretation of the EU definition of a medicinal product, has revised and updated the similar guidelines published by my Department in 1988. The policy in regard to the controls in force in respect of medicinal products, including 'natural' medicinal products, has not changed in any significant way.</P>
      <P>If a product placed on the market includes a medicinal claim, the product concerned becomes a medicinal product and should be the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board under the Medicinal Product (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998. These regulations give effect in this country to the EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC. Before the board may grant an authorisation, it must first be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product concerned. In the case of unlicensed products that may be available on the market, neither the safety, quality nor efficacy of such products would have been established by the board.</P>
      <P>Products containing the herb <i>hypericum perforatum,</i> St John's Wort, are medicinal products and, as such, must be the subject of product authorisations from the Irish Medicines Board in order that they may lawfully be placed on the market in this country. The decision by the board to recommend that products containing St John's Wort should be placed on medical prescription was taken following appropriate medical assessment by the board. This was subsequently advised to my Department. A number of reasons has been given by the board for its recommendation. These include the fact that the products appear to act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors &ndash; MAOIs. These products must, therefore, be used with particular care because of risks of interactions, not just with other medicines, but also with certain foods. Patients, therefore, may be at risk from hypertension &ndash; increased blood pressure &ndash; if these products were to be taken with certain other antidepressants, over-the-counter cough mixtures &ndash; sympathomimetics &ndash; and with foods rich in tyramine such as cheese, yeast extract and red wine. Side effects such as photosensitivity, gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and nervousness have also been reported. Furthermore, the board has expressed concern at the possible treatment of mild to moderate depression by use of an over the counter medicine. The board considers that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self diagnosis and self medication are inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The placing of any medicinal product under prescription-only control is carried out in the interest of protecting public health and safety and where it is considered appropriate that such products should be used only under medical supervision and advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by both con<Col N="1031" /> sumers and representative organisations regarding the decision to place products containing St. Johns Wort under prescription-only control and I would like to assure the Deputies that it is not my intention to in any way interfere with the rights of individuals to avail of appropriate medicines which they may wish to use. However, it is generally accepted that in the interest of consumer health and protection, some form of regulation of 'alternative medicines' is desirable and this view is supported in principle by the health food and alternative medicines industry. In this respect, the European Commission is currently considering what controls, if any, should be applied to 'health food' products and 'natural' medicines, including the possibility of providing simplified procedures for the licensing of alternative or traditional medicines, but no definitive proposals have been brought forward at this stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the availability of products containing <i>hypericum perforatum</i> under the general medical services scheme, I would like to advise the Deputy that since such products have not been authorised under the Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations 1998, their eligibility for inclusion in the general medical services scheme does not arise.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the long period patients must spend in the casualty unit of James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Dublin 15, before they are attended to; if he will allocate additional funds to the hospital in order that it can address this problem; the plans, if any, he has to address this problem nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and in this regard all accident and emergency departments experience periods of exceptional demand which can result in delays for patients. However, it is important to note that appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times and that waiting periods are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, I made an additional £2.3 million available for the development of accident and emergency services. This additional funding was used to fund a national public education campaign aimed at persuading people with minor ailments to attend their family doctor rather than a hospital accident and emergency department, and also to facilitate the implementation of a range of initiatives aimed at addressing some of the difficulties being experienced in accident and emergency departments, including the accident and emergency department at James Connolly <Col N="1032" /> Memorial Hospital particularly during periods of peak demand.</P>
    <P>In the current year I provided further funding of £2 million to enable major acute hospitals to continue the development of theses initiatives in accident and emergency departments, including the accident and emergency department at James Connolly Memorial Hospital. These initiatives included measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They allowed for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment/observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have also published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and am committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented. The report is one of a number of measures which I have taken to address the question of long waiting lists and waiting times. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999. This is a 66 per cent percent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997. The report recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>In an effort to address these problems, I have provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people. This funding will help to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used, <i>inter alia,</i> to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards. There are also a number of chronic sick and disabled patients in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. I have provided additional capital and revenue funding of £1.002 million and £0.438 million respectively in the current year to facilitate the provision of appropriate <Col N="1033" /> alternative care facilities for these patients on acute hospital sites and in private nursing homes. The task of securing these alternative care plans is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months. I am confident that the measures I have outlined will contribute to improvements in availability of beds in the acute sector and ease pressures in accident and emergency departments.</P>

In July 1997, the assistant inspector of mental hospitals was informed by the management of the Midland Health Board that allegations concerning sexual activity between patients in St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar, had been made by a member of staff and that they were being investigated by the board. In March 1998 a report of alleged sexual activity between two patients at St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar, was received from the clinical director of the hospital by the inspector of mental hospitals. Subsequently, following an inspection of the hospital, the inspector drew the attention of the Department to the poor conditions prevailing in the <Col N="1034" /> ward in question and the necessity to transfer four female patients who were at that time accommodated there.</P>
      <P>Following discussions between the Department and the Midland Health Board, the female patients were transferred to other accommodation within St. Loman's Hospital. In addition, a major programme of upgrading of facilities at St. Loman's Hospital was agreed, including the upgrading of the ward in question. I have to date provided capital funding totalling £841,000 to the Midland Health Board towards the improvement of facilities at St. Loman's Hospital.</P>
      <P>There were no reports of injuries sustained by patients at St. Loman's Hospital received from the Midland Health Board between 1994 and 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has no function in relation to privately funded maternity hospitals or units. National statistics on all live and stillbirths are collected as an integral part of the birth notification system. The Central Statistics Office provides information on variables such as period of gestation, birthweight and maternal age in its annual report on vital statistics. Detailed national statistics are derived from the birth notification system as part of the perinatal reporting system which is administered by the Economic and Social Research Institute on behalf of my Department. Data covers perinatal outcomes classified by parity, method of delivery, type of antenatal care, diagnoses and other relevant factors. The purpose of the report is to describe fundamental social and biological characteristics of mothers and their babies, to report on outcomes with particular reference to perinatal mortality and to highlight important aspects of perinatal care.</P>
      <P>In addition, the three publicly funded Dublin maternity hospitals produce a detailed clinical report in relation to activity and outcome. Activity in these hospitals would be representative of almost 50 per cent of all births. In the case of the health boards, additional information is prepared and forwarded for audit purposes to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</P>

      <Quest>the structure and functioning of the reporting relationships between his Department and all public voluntary health boards and private maternity hospitals or units; his views on whether these arrangements are adequate in view of the Government's commitment to accountability, transparency and quality in service delivery and the number of caesarean hysterectomies at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, County Louth.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> Under existing reporting requirements each health board is legally obliged to prepare and submit an annual report on its activities to my Department. Within each health board area the reporting relationship from service units to the board is a matter for each board to address, in compliance with its overall responsibility for service delivery. Maternity homes registered by the health boards under the Registration of Maternity Homes Act, 1934, must comply with the provisions of this Act and any regulations made under this Act.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the production of annual clinical reports by health agencies as part of this process and see it as a valuable contribution to the development and promotion of a process of continuous quality improvement across health agencies. As the Deputy is aware, such an arrangement exists in the Dublin maternity hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that the situation which arose at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, which was operating at the time as a voluntary hospital, applies in the case of health board maternity hospitals and units. I am advised by the North-Eastern Health Board, which now has responsibility for services provided at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, that no caesarean hysterectomies have been carried out since late October 1998. I am further advised that the North-Eastern Health Board has made a range of important improvements at the hospital, with the full participation and co-operation of all relevant consultant and nursing staff, including revised protocols and procedures for the maternity unit and delivery suite to ensure that best practice is in place; all of the relevant hospital consultant and nursing staff are co-operating fully with the North-Eastern Health Board management in implementing agreed protocols and procedures including audits if these procedures; new arrangements for the management of ante-natal clinics, admission protocols regarding assessment and discharge of women who are in labour are in place; a twice-weekly reporting system is in place which involves consultants and midwifery staff; improvements in the consultative process regarding the management of midwifery and obstetric care; and the use of customer care satisfaction surveys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to domiciliary births, an expert group was established under the auspices of the health board chief executive officers to consider approaches to domiciliary births. The expert group submitted its report to the chief executive officers at the end of 1998 and recommended a number of pilot projects. To facilitate the implementation of the expert group recommendations, appropriate funding was allocated to the relevant health boards in 1999. Following evaluation of the projects the policy, procedures and protocols necessary for domiciliary births will be developed.</P>
      <P>I am advised by management in the maternity hospitals that prenatal tests, including ultrasound scanning have been available to independent midwifes and this service will continue in the future.</P>
      <P>However, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind I will be happy to take the matter up with the relevant agency. I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to the provision of a comprehensive and equitable obstetric service within the public hospital sector.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that the recruitment of midwives is primarily a matter for individual employers. Last year a new nursing policy division was established in my Department. Its primary function is to ensure that there is an integrated and strengthened nursing function within my Department at this important stage in the development of nursing. A number of nurse researchers have been appointed to the division. One of these researchers has been specifically engaged to undertake a study of the nursing and midwifery resource. The aim of this project is to analyse the present position with regard to the nursing and midwifery workforce, and to devise a system for the projection of future needs and plan how these needs may be met. I might add that a further nurse, who will act as a professional adviser on midwifery to my Department, is due to take up appointment shortly.</P>

      <P>This report was conducted, as the Deputy states, under the aegis of the Coombe women's hospital and funded by the Department of Health. The study relates to the period 1981-85 and was completed in 1992. In view of the time which elapsed between the commencement of the study and its completion it was decided not to publish the report.</P>
      <P>The report was, however, made available to the maternity and infant care review group which considered, <i>inter alia</i>, the question of domiciliary births and made recommendations. Funding was provided in 1999 to the relevant health boards for the piloting of a number of the approaches suggested.</P>

      <Quest>the progress to date in relation to the provision of a renal or kidney unit for the Midland Health Board area; when this will be provided; if in the interim his Department will install this unit at one of the empty buildings at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in view of the fact a significant number of people from Longford and Westmeath have to travel to Dublin for dialysis treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In order to provide the best possible level of patient care it is important to concentrate renal facilities in an appropriate location. In the Midland Health Board area, it is proposed to base renal dialysis services in Tullamore General Hospital. The service has been included in the plans for the development of Tullamore General Hospital and will serve the needs of the region in as efficient and effective a manner as possible.</P>
      <P>The project team for the development of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, Mullingar, has commenced its deliberations and is working on the preparation of an updated brief for the whole hospital. In view of the nature of the services involved, the Midland Health Board has no plans to develop a renal dialysis facility on this site. It has concluded that it would not be practicable to provide a unit on a temporary basis at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital. However, the board will continue to ensure that the renal dialysis needs of the population in its area are properly met pending the provision of the unit in Tullamore.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1999, devolve all significant decisions relating to the licensing of taxis, wheelchair accessible taxis and hackneys to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Under these arrangements, a local authority may, as a reserved function, declare an area to be a taximeter area, may determine the number of taxi licences to be granted in respect of that area and may also determine that hackney licences shall not be granted in its functional area.</P>
      <P>The grant of taxi licences and-or wheelchair accessible taxi licences arises in taximeter areas only and must be assessed by local authorities on the basis of criteria &ndash; points &ndash; set out in the regulations and in accordance with any determination of licence numbers made by them. Hackney licences are available without restriction from local authorities, except in cases where they have decided that such licences will not be granted in their functional area. Hackneys may provide services in any part of the country and no points system applies in relation to their licensing.</P>
      <P>Applicants for taxi and hackney licences must also pay the appropriate licence fee, provide a certificate issued by the Garda confirming that the vehicle is suitable to be licensed and produce evidence that the use of the vehicle will be covered by insurance.</P>
      <P>I understand that Wexford County Council has not as yet declared any part of its functional area to be a taximeter area but that hackney licences are available on application.</P>

    <P>New requirements on planning authorities concerning the taking in charge of housing estates are provided in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999. The Bill provides that where an estate has been completed to the satisfaction of the local authority, the authority must take an estate in charge when the developer or a majority of the residents request that the authority do so, through the procedures set out in the Roads Act 1993. Where an estate is unfinished, and the period, seven years for taking enforcement action has expired, and a majority of the residents so request, the planning authority will be obliged to take the estate in charge. The Bill is currently before the Seanad.</P>

The proposed works included the refurbishment of the houses, rewiring, the replacement of windows and doors, the provision of central heating, together with environmental works to the estate. The cost was estimated to be in the order of £500,000 at 1997 prices.

    <P>In addition, families at greatest risk of poverty receive income support up to age 22 in respect of children in full-time education. Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years; however, where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. This applies to long-term payments, such as pensions only; it does not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with chil<Col N="1046" /> dren on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>

      <P>Determinations which I make under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, are confined to determining the intrinsic scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest of a building, and do not purport to determine the entitlement or otherwise of owners-occupiers to claim tax relief under the Act.</P>
      <P>The position is that the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural, or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for relief for expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Since I became Minister in June 1997, I have made determinations in respect of 62 buildings for the purposes of section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. However, it would not be appropriate to disclose information regarding these determinations because the position is that applicants to me may subsequently have decided not to proceed with seeking a separate determination from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of reasonable public access, or indeed may have been refused a determination in respect of reasonable public access by the Revenue Commissioners. In either of these situations, the owner-occupier of the building would not be entitled to claim tax relief under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>

      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for private restoration projects of the type referred to by the Deputy. However, one source of public funds for such heritage projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that although my Department funds the Heritage Council, which is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act 1995, I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants. I was pleased, however, to be able to increase the funding to the council from £4 million in 1998 to £5.08 million in the current year, an increase of 27 per cent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that in May of last year, together with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I launched the package of proposals for the strengthening and protection of the architectural heritage. That package, which is being progressively implemented by both Departments, adopts a comprehensive approach to the protection of our architectural heritage in its many and varied forms, rather than singling out individual aspects of that heritage. As part of the package, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government recently launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities with funding of the order of £4 million per annum. The group referred to by the Deputy may wish to make inquiries with their own local authority in regard to the possibility of applying for grant aid under that scheme.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that intelligence indicates that there is small scale heroin use outside Dublin. In the recent past there have been a small number of heroin seizures in Athlone, Cork and Limerick, which have resulted in a number of persons being charged under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.</P>
      <P>The following table sets out the number of Misuse of Drugs Act offences involving heroin, where proceedings commenced by region in each of the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 as per the annual report of An Garda Síochána. In each year, more than 98 per cent of the offences were recorded in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of this question, juvenile offenders are taken to be those under the age of 18 years. Male offenders aged 16 and 17, and up to the age of 21, may be committed on remand or to serve a period of detention at St. Patrick's Institution. Male offenders aged 17 years and over may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to the five adult committal prisons &ndash; Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea. Sentenced male offenders aged 16 and 17 may be transferred from any of the five adult committal prisons and from St. Patrick's Institution to Wheatfield Place of Detention, Fort Mitchel and Shanganagh Castle to serve their sentences. When the new remand prison at Cloverhill is fully operational, all male remand offenders will be held there, including juveniles who will be accommodated separate from adults.</P>
      <P>Female offenders aged 17 years and over may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to Mountjoy and Limerick Women's Prisons. However, very few female offenders aged 17 years are committed to penal institutions each year. There were two females aged 17 in custody on Monday 8 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While every effort is made to segregate 16 and 17 year old offenders from the general prison population in each institution at all times, this is <Col N="1051" /> not always possible due to pressures of overcrowding and the high turnover of inmates. Those held in the more traditional adult prisons are accommodated with other young offenders or with carefully selected older prisoners.</P>
    <P>The legal provisions for the committal of young offenders under the age of 18 years will change on enactment of the Children Bill, 1996 which proposes that where a court imposes a sentence of detention on a child, it shall, (a) where the child is under 16 years of age, order the child to be detained in a children's detention school &ndash; operated by the Department of Education and Science; (b) where the child is 16 or 17 years of age, order the child to be detained in a place of detention &ndash; provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, separate, dedicated secure detention centres will be required for the accommodation of male and female child &ndash; 16 and 17 years &ndash; offenders and these will be provided. The director general of the Prison Service is currently examining the feasibility of providing two dedicated secure child detention centres, one in the Dublin area and one in the Munster area.</P>

      <P>Discussions took place earlier this year between officials of my Department, Donegal County Council and the local district court judge regarding court premises in County Donegal. It emerged at that meeting that there was no suitable venue available in Ballybofey-Stranorlar for district court sittings and this remains the position at present.</P>
      <P>The matter is being kept under review and has recently been the subject of consultations between the chief executive designate of the new courts service and the local authority. I understand that further consultations between the newly established courts service and the local authority, Judiciary and other court users are planned with a view to considering the restoration of a court presence in Ballybofey.</P>

      <P>The Children Bill, 1999, <Col N="1053" /> which I published recently, gives the courts power to impose a restriction on movement order on children, i.e. persons under 18 years of age. The order can confine a child to a particular residence at specified times between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. the following day or order the child to stay away from any specified premises, place or locality during specified days or between specified times.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides that an action plan, which can be formulated at a conference convened either as part of the Garda diversion programme or following a direction by the Children Court to the probation and welfare service, may make provision confining a child to his or her home at specified times.</P>
      <P>In addition, a condition of temporary leave from a children detention school may require a child to remain in specified living accommodation for different periods on different dates.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that Navan Garda station is open to the public on a 24 hour basis. There are four official vehicles allocated to it and these are utilised in patrolling the area. This patrolling is also augmented as necessary by other resources from within the Meath-Louth Garda Division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has not specified any particular geographical area in his question in relation to illegal parking, I have confined my response to the position in the Dublin metropolitan area. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that there is no significant problem of illegal parking of travellers on public pavements within the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
      <P>However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that when the need arises, the gardaí can act to deal with situations where travellers park on footpaths under the Roads Act, 1993 and Housing (Travellers Accommodation) Act, 1998. Also on occasions fines-on-the-spot have been issued in accordance with the provisions of the Litter Pollution Act 1997.</P>
      <P>I understand that Garda powers were utilised recently as follows:</P>
      <P>(I)nine caravan owners were prosecuted under section 69(1) Roads Act, 1993, on 5 November 1999. As a result, I understand that all of the travellers involved moved from where they were illegally camped at a site at Loughlinstown.</P>
      <P>(II) Furthermore, travellers parked on a pavement at City West dispersed following service of a section 10 notice under the Housing (Travellers Accommodation) Act, 1998, on 30 July 1999.</P>
      <P>Where offences take place on private property, the matter is left to civil remedy. Owners of private property have intervened by way of court orders. I understand that incidents of illegal parking on pavements are confined to three divisions within the Dublin metropolitan region i.e. east, south and western division. Where incidents are reported to the gardaí the travellers move when requested to do so by gardaí and no serious confrontational situations have arisen.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that there is no basis for the alleged view that the Garda Síochána do not enforce the full rigours of the laws in relation to illegal activity by members of the travelling community. I am further assured by the Garda authorities that the criminal law is enforced in a uniform manner throughout the state and all people are similarly subject to the law.</P>

      <P>The managerial authorities of the Christian Brothers' secondary school in New Ross appointed a design team prior to my Department agreeing schedules of accommodation and without reference to my Department. School authorities have never been delegated sanction to engage consultants in the expectation that my Department would be bound by any such arrangements. Acceptance of such arrangements would almost certainly contravene public procurement procedures with which my Department must ensure complete adherence.</P>
      <P>The procedures employed by my Department for the appointment of consultants are designed to ensure that relevant EU and national procurement regulations are adhered to and that the systems used are transparent, fair and equitable. Consistent with my Department's procedures, nominations for the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning of the proposed project at this school have been provided to the school's board of management. Unfortunately, architectural planning of the project cannot begin until the board appoint a design team from the nominations provided.</P>

      <P>I understand that the primary concern of the parents of the person concerned is to establish that he received credit for both elements of the agricultural science examination. I am assured that the results obtained in leaving certificate agricultural science by the person concerned include marks for both components of the examination i.e. project and written examination. The candidate appealed the grade awarded but the result remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>I understand that the candidate has now made a request to the examination commissioners for independent verification that the Department followed the appeal procedures correctly. The examination commissioners will consider this shortly. The examination commissioners have access to all relevant documentation including the marks awarded for each component.</P>
