      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Owen. I call on Deputy Owen to state the matter of which she gave me notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent public importance: the suspension of the sale of Cablelink Ltd., the serious allegation that one of the companies bidding for Cablelink may have attempted to form a price-fixing arrangement and that an invalid bid for Cablelink may have been accepted. Given the major flotations of other State companies likely to take place in the future, this allegation has the potential seriously to undermine their success.</P>

    <P>
      <b>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources </b>
    </P>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): It is proposed to take No. <i>a</i>9, motion re Priority Questions; No. <i>b</i>9, motion re Oral Questions and No. 33, Statements on BIM Seafood Industry Agenda 2000-2006 Report. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) Nos. <i>a</i>9 and <i>b</i>9 shall be decided without debate; (2) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 33: (i) the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes; and (3) the Dáil, on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 May 1999.</P>

      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. <i>a9</i> and <i>b</i>9 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 33 agreed? <Col N="3" /> Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the adjournment of the Dáil agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister ask the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to make a statement as soon as possible, to clarify the situation with regard to Cablelink? The matter is causing deep concern for the flotations of State companies and about the manner in which the sale of this State asset is being conducted.</P>
      <P>The Electricity Regulation Bill, 1998 is before the House. Can the Minister tell us if a major dispute has arisen between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats concerning this legislation, given the interview by the deputy leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, in which he declared the Bill to be very protective of the ESB and appeared to challenge Deputy O'Rourke's legislation? Has a dispute arisen on this matter and when will the House proceed with the legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Owen knows, the London based firm of investment bankers, Rothschild, was contracted by Telecom Éireann and RTE to manage the sale of the shareholding. Bids were invited, the deadline date for submission of indicative offers was 10 March and a number of people responded. As matters since the deadline date of 10 March are before the High Court, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time. The court may give some ruling on the matter as early as tomorrow. I will convey the Deputy's request to the Minster who may comply with it as soon as the court has completed its business.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Electricity Regulation Bill, to establish the ESB as a company under the Companies Act, will now be included in the Electricity Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister inform the House if the Whips have considered the proposal I made yesterday to allocate time for statements in response to allegations of sexual abuse and mistreatment in State run and State funded institutions made in the RTE programme, &ldquo;States of <Col N="4" /> Fear&rdquo;, and for an apology to the victims of that abuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is sympathetic to the points made by the leader of the Labour Party, as are all Members of the House. This matter affects, not merely the House but all of Irish society. There is a Cabinet sub-committee which will present its report to Government shortly. There will be no difficulty at that stage in having a broad-ranging debate. This can be arranged by the Whips. There are no differences between us on this issue. Society should respond comprehensively to these appalling revelations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there are no divisions in the House on the matter. Members want to express their point of view. Given the experience of some on this side of the House of Cabinet, Government and the legal advice of the Attorney General, the last thing we want is a Cabinet sub-committee, the members of which will be told that they cannot open their mouths for fear of incurring compensation costs. It is a matter of considerable regret that in respect of other scandals &ndash; I cannot be specific &ndash; Ministers were unable to apologise for what had happened, notwithstanding the legitimate claims for compensation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We should learn from that experience. It is clear from the Order of Business that we are not overburdened with legislative measures. Deputies on all sides of the House &ndash; officeholders and former officeholders &ndash; should be afforded an opportunity to make the apology which most of the people concerned want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government reconsider and place the child care inspectorate on a statutory basis to ensure children in care in institutions receive the protection they require, now that we know what went on in those dark years when children were locked away and the public was not aware of what was happening to them? Will the Government also reconsider Deputy Currie's proposal that there should be an ombudsman for children so that 20 years from now we will not be indicted by those who follow us into this House who will ask why we did nothing about the situation in child care institutions?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> In the minds of many, a Cabinet sub-committee reporting smacks of putting the matter on the long finger. The shock expressed by the nation in response to appalling systematic cruelty by institutions of the State as well as the Church merits a quick catharsis, an acknowledgement of the enormous pain and suffering, a quick apology and proposals for compensation. The Dáil should deal with the issue next week at the latest. Time should be made available for statements to bring to an end, in so far as is possible, the pain and suffering of so many innocent children who are now adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>An immediate response is required. As the Whips appear to have overlooked the request made yesterday, consideration should be given to making time available &ndash; say, two hours &ndash; for statements to allow Deputies express regret and make an apology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with other Members on all these issues. While I understand Deputy Sargent's point that a quick response is required, the Cabinet sub-committee which has been looking at the matter nationally and internationally will present its report, which is comprehensive, to Government almost immediately. Members will then have an opportunity &ndash; the Whips can discuss the timing &ndash; to express the horror not just of the House but of the nation at the extent and severity of the revelations. The matter must be addressed comprehensively. Not alone must we look back, we must, as Deputies Mitchell and Owen said, also look forward. The Minister for Education and Science has been deeply involved. Together, in an historic approach, we can apologise for what happened in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Who are the members of the Cabinet sub-committee? Does it include the Ministers for Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Will the Government consider placing the child care inspectorate on a statutory basis so that it will have the powers it needs? Because services are often provided voluntarily there has been a failure to intervene in time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They meet regularly. They are discussing the business for next week. The Cabinet sub-committee includes the Ministers for Social, Community and Family Affairs; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Education and Science; Health and Children; and the Marine and Natural Resources who have been involved in some of these matters during the years, as well as the Attorney General. It is the Taoiseach's desire that consideration should be as broad-ranging as possible. All issues, including those mentioned by Deputy Owen and others, on which we have been reluctant to take certain steps, will be dealt with comprehensively. The reason the committee has been deliberating over a period is to look comprehensively at the issue.</P>

    <Title>BIM Seafood Industry Agenda 2000-2006 Report: Statements.</Title>
    <P>
      <b>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources </b>
    </P>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): I am pleased to have this opportunity to review developments in the fishing industry and to set out for the Dáil my policy objectives for the sector and my strategic approach to delivering on those objectives. My objective is to ensure a sustainable and vibrant future for the Irish seafood industry and the communities which it supports backed up by the necessary level of funding to underpin investment post 2000.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the full backing and commitment of BIM in the task of delivering on that strategic objective for the sector. The BIM plan for 2000-6 is an invaluable input into the challenging task ahead to deliver a sustainable future for, and with, the industry and coastal communities.</P>
    <P>The fleet, processing, aquaculture and ancillary service sectors already support jobs for 16,000 people in areas where there are few alternative employment opportunities. The sector is worth £300 million per annum to the national economy. That is important because it applies in areas where there are few alternative opportunities. Irish seafood exports are now valued at £250 million. The achievements to date underlie the significant potential for further growth in this indigenous natural resource based sector which will deliver jobs and growth, particularly in peripheral coastal communities.</P>
    <P>Our existing development strategies have been focused on the modernisation and renewal of the fleet, the continued sustainable growth of the aquaculture sector, expansion in onshore processing and the development of fishery harbours infrastructure and aquaculture landing places. A <Col N="11" /> feature of this year's budget was that extra funds were made available. That was very helpful, although the plans for the future are going ahead. My commitment and that of the Government to the development of the sector is clearly underlined in the delivery last year of funding support and tax incentives for the white fish fleet renewal programme supporting up to £60 million investment in the fleet.</P>
    <P>I also achieved, in the context of the budget for 1999, a very major increase in Exchequer funding for fishery harbours and aquaculture infrastructure development. There is still much to be done and the immediate challenge now is to position the sector firmly to deliver on its recognised economic potential and development needs into the next millennium with EU Structural Funds support.</P>
    <P>My strategic objective is to enhance the safety and competitiveness of the fleet, the quality of landings and to maximise supply through full and effective take up of available quotas and to rapidly develop non-quota fishing opportunities. A critical commercial imperative for the industry at this point in its development is to ensure that supply is matched to demand in terms of price, quality availability and regularity. In addition, therefore, to improving supply and fishing opportunities, we must tackle the demand side, especially product quality and markets. Achieving these policy objectives will require new partnerships and co-operation between the various players, including the catching, processing and exporting sectors.</P>
    <P>In the context of the strategies necessary to deliver on the safety, quality and competitive needs of the industry, I will outline current developments in the industry and set out my objectives for development over the next six years. The whitefish fleet generates most of the employment in the fishing sector and accounts for 65 per cent of the value of fish landings. My first priority in office was to deliver on measures for the renewal of the whitefish fleet in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium. I am pleased to inform the House that the whitefish fleet renewal programme which I announced last year is already paying dividends with new boats being ordered for the whitefish fleet for the first lime in many years. The tax reliefs secured in the Finance Act, 1998, and the capital grant programme has created a new climate of opportunity and will catalyse the much needed degree of change in the fish sector. My investment support strategy is helping significant investment in the renewal of the whitefish fleet. The re-investment now under way in the fleet will enable full and efficient quota take-up and enable Irish fishermen to develop new non-quota fishing opportunities. Safety and competitiveness will be improved and existing employment maintained with potential for additional jobs at sea and in processing and supply services. Over the medium term we need <Col N="12" /> to build on the progress to date in terms of the renewal of the whitefish fleet, in particular by supporting and fostering the synergies between the fleet and the processing sectors. Linkage between supply and demand is the key to a competitive future.</P>
    <P>The parameters governing support for the fisheries sector in the coming six years will be laid down at EU and national level. The terms and conditions governing EU funding for the fisheries sector are decided by the Fisheries Council. It is imperative that EU rules on aid facilitate rather than stifle the continued development of the Irish industry. The actual amount of EU and Exchequer aid for the fisheries sector will primarily be determined at national level. Therefore, decisions taken at the Fisheries Council and in Government in the coming months will be critical to the future of the industry. I am working on both fronts to achieve the necessary investment support for the sector in the next round.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated in the House, I have fundamental problems in principle and in practice with the Commission's proposed terms and conditions for grant aiding fleet renewal under the next round of Structural Funds. At the March Fisheries Council I made clear my total opposition to the Commission's proposals, and with the support of other colleagues secured the German Presidency's agreement to re-examine the Commission's proposals.</P>
    <P>The Commission's opening proposals include a 130 per cent tonnage replacement requirement as a precondition for grant aiding the introduction of vessels. The Commission is also proposing a number of other restrictive fleet capacity management measures, including an effective ban on the trading of fishing vessels within the EU fleet. Essentially, the Commission is seeking to set fleet capacity parameters which are much more restrictive than the MGP IV fleet programme framework which was agreed by Council in 1997. It also seeks to pre-empt future decisions by Council about the nature and framework of the next fleet programme, MGP V, for the period after 2001. The impact of this proposal is that 130 tonnes would have to be found to replace 100 tonnes where replacement tonnage has to be found. This would automatically decrease the size of the fleet and is an indirect way of doing so.</P>
    <P>We agree the funding for fleet modernisation in the next round should, as at present, be subject to member states meeting their obligations under the MGP programmes. To that extent, the funding proposals should take due account of the existing MGP Council decisions and parameters laid down in the individual fleet programmes of member states. However, it is not acceptable for the Commission to try to rewrite the 1997 Council decision on MGP IV and to pre-empt political negotiations and decisions on the parameters for the next MGP which will be determined in 2001. The German Presidency is consulting with Ireland and other member states on the scope for compromise, but in light of the Commission's <Col N="13" /> very hard line, compromise will be a difficult and very tough battle. The fishing industry organisation has been fully briefed on the Commission proposals and I know I have its full support in opposing these unduly restrictive measures.</P>
    <P>At national level, I am seeking a fair share of funding to support the continued modernisation of the whitefish fleet in the next round. Further re-investment in the fleet will be necessary to improve safety, efficiency and competitiveness and to ensure employment is maintained.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen exceptional growth in consumer demand for seafood within the European Union and worldwide. Very significant changes are taking place in traditional seafood markets around the world. Patterns of consumption are changing fast, with a huge potential market for a wide variety of high value seafood as well as for fresh product. Competition is intense and the liberalisation of world trade is adding to the market challenge for the Irish industry. There are significant opportunities, therefore, but also significant challenges.</P>
    <P>I am firmly committed to supporting the development of the fish processing sector, to delivering maximum returns from our fisheries resources and to ensuring the economic benefits of our seafood exports accrue to Ireland in terms of value added. Continued strong growth in the fish processing sector is critical for jobs, growth, value added and exports in the Irish seafood industry overall. Fish processing output is on a steady upward growth curve and amounted to 145,000 tonnes in 1997, valued at £213 million. There are significant opportunities for further growth. A buoyant market exists for seafood in the EU and worldwide. Consumption will continue to follow an upward trend creating the opportunity to develop new products to satisfy market need and allowing the industry to move along the value chain.</P>
    <P>The further development of the processing industry is critical for jobs, growth, value added and exports in the fishing industry overall. A total investment of £26 million has been supported since 1994 in more than 110 fish processing projects. We need to build on that investment and move to the next phase of development. A thriving processing sector is vital for the prosperity of the fishing industry and the communities in which those processing plants are located. There is still a great deal to be done to realise the full potential of the fish processing sector, particularly in terms of quality, value added and scale. We add some 50 per cent to the value of our fish through processing while other countries achieve up to 200 per cent in added value. We must deliver maximum value from our fisheries resources and ensure the economic benefits of our exports accrue to Ireland. There is no point in having excellent fish if most of the benefit accrues elsewhere. New products, new technologies, first class quality and improved continuity of supply are the key challenges. Capacity expansion, product technology and product development in the <Col N="14" /> processing sector will require a significant level of funding support after 2000. This is a key priority for me. The sound economics of supporting investment in this indigenous, natural, resource-based sector are self-evident. I welcome BIM's solid endorsement and analysis of the potential in its Seafood Industry Agenda 2000-2006 which underpins my assessment and which will be an invaluable input into the task of securing the necessary funding support for the sector after 2000.</P>
    <P>There are certain challenges facing the herring and mackerel sector and I have worked in the past year to position the industry to maintain a strong presence and become more competitive in a tough international environment. The EU and global pelagic market is characterised by oversupply, low prices and changing consumer trends. It has also been badly affected by the economic situation in Russia, one of the key markets for mackerel and also an important market for herring. The herring market situation remains difficult. The main underlying global factor affecting herring continues to be oversupply and changing trends on the Japanese herring roe and European herring flap markets which are the key outlets for Irish herring exports.</P>
    <P>I have delivered comprehensively on the concrete recommendations of the task force on the management and marketing of herring since it reported to me in March of last year. The strategies proposed were directed at creating a new partnership approach supporting improved operational efficiency and ensuring better co-operation in management and marketing. A key initiative which I put in place last autumn was the introduction of quality training programmes for the herring fleet and processing sector. There was an excellent take-up of the scheme and I am confident the results will begin to show in improved product handling and processing. I also recently approved the appointment of a pelagic market co-ordinator by BIM who will work with the Irish herring and mackerel exporters on a co-ordinated focused approach to market development in eastern Europe and worldwide. I want to see fish exporters working more closely together on sales strategies and market intelligence. It works well for the Norwegians and the Dutch in the international marketplace. We must aspire to similar high standards of professionalism and teamwork in the overall interests of the industry. It is important for the interests of the catching and processing sectors in the pelagic sector to work more closely together. National co-operation will ensure the maximum return from our valuable pelagic opportunities. Partnership within the industry is the key to moving forward in the medium to long term.</P>
    <P>At my request BIM is working closely with the fish processing and exporting companies to maximise product and marketing opportunities on the domestic and export markets. Good progress is being made to develop existing and new markets for Irish seafood worldwide. Fish exports have <Col N="15" /> increased by some 60 per cent since 1990 and were valued at £230 million in 1997. BIM has now completed a strategic analysis of the home market and has put in place a market-led strategy for the future. The strategy aims to reflect modern lifestyle requirements by improving the range and availability of appropriate products while also increasing consumer, retail and catering trade awareness of seafood as an attractive user-friendly product. The secondary strategy will have a long-term education focus where the versatility and convenience of seafood is promoted to existing consumers in the catering and retail sector and future consumers. The strategic focus in the export market will be on sustained development of existing markets and expansion into new markets which offer significant opportunities. The development of value added export product is a key to competitiveness and market edge for Irish seafood companies.</P>
    <P>Strong and continued support from the EU for fisheries training is important. Under the current operational programme for fisheries, almost £800,000 per annum of EU funds has been allocated towards fisheries training. In addition, EU funding has been allocated for training from the PESCA Community initiative, the INTERREG programme and the smallscale fisheries programme. I look forward to continued strong support from the EU for fisheries training which is vital to the future of the industry. The demand for fisheries training has grown and will continue to grow as a result of safety, quality, health and hygiene requirements and the impact of the technology revolution, including range and sophistication of equipment, electronics and aquaculture techniques. The implementation of the recommendations of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group creates additional safety training requirements. Training is also a vital complement to the whitefish fleet renewal programme. We must ensure that the industry avails of enhanced training programmes to support the new investment in the fleet.</P>
    <P>I have taken a number of initiatives in order to meet the increased demand for fisheries training. I have provided the funding for the new regional fisheries training centre at Castletownbere, which I formally opened two weeks ago. This new training centre will serve the needs of the industry in the south-west catchment area. Improved regional and local access to training is a critical part of my objective to enhance safety, quality and competitiveness. The Castletownbere centre represents my commitment and that of BIM to the local provision of high quality service for the catching, aquaculture and processing sector.</P>
    <P>The Castletownbere facility will augment the fisheries training programmes at BIM's fisheries training centre at Greencastle and by the two mobile coastal training units which play a vital role in bringing safety training to fishermen in our more remote coastal locations. These units, which are equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, bring <Col N="16" /> safety training directly to small coastal communities. They complement the national centre at Greencastle and the Castletownbere facility. These units enabled more than 300 fishermen and fish farmers to acquire safety and certificate training in their home ports during 1997.</P>
    <P>There are two other strategic developments which will impact on future training delivery. First, I am setting up a training and employment task force for the fishing industry. The task force will identify the actions needed to overcome the barriers to local employment in the sector. Through this forum the fishing industry will have an opportunity to bring forward proposals to tackle similar challenges to those which faced the shipping sector. The task force will be led by and will include key representatives of the industry. They will bring their experience and responsibilities to bear on the problems, including working conditions, training strategies and health and safety requirements.</P>
    <P>The development of an integrated human resource development strategy is critical to the future development of the seafood sector. I welcome BIM's commitment to a strategic training plan in Seafood Industry Agenda 2000-06. I have asked BIM to begin work immediately on a medium-term training strategy in close consultation with the industry and in light of the INDECON report on fisheries training which has been circulated to all key players. Expenditure on training must be cost-effective, must represent value for money and must meet the development needs of the industry. A clear strategic plan is essential to ensure optimum delivery for the industry.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is critically dependent on berthage and on-shore facilities for landings and services. Investment to date under the operational programme has delivered a substantial volume of improvements and refurbishment at fishery harbours. This investment provided for a new harbour in Kilmore Quay, an upgraded auction hall in Killybegs, the upgrading of the pier in Greencastle and the upgrading of small strategic harbours around the coast. I secured a 300 per cent increase for investment in fishery harbours in 1999. Key priorities include Killybegs, Dingle, Burtonport and Castletownbere, as well as a range of small but vitally important harbours.</P>
    <P>There is a <i>prima facie</i> case for further expenditure on fishery harbours and facilities in the next round. The investment is needed to bridge the infrastructure gap, eliminate serious bottlenecks and congestion and improve safety as well as efficiency and competitiveness. The investment in piers and facilities will underpin the planned expansion of the fish processing and aquaculture sectors.</P>
    <P>Under the operational programme for fisheries, significant progress was made in upgrading national laboratory facilities, research vessel capability, with the construction of the new research vessel, the <i>Celtic Voyager,</i> and the establishment of a national marine RTD project fund<Col N="17" /> ing mechanism. Ireland's investment in marine research continues to significantly lag behind that of our European partners. It is now time to recognise the commercial return of research and development investment and I will seek a significant increase in the level of funding for marine research in the next round.</P>
    <P>With Government agreement I launched the Marine Institute's marine research technology, development and innovation strategy last year. The strategy document provides a detailed evaluation of the research and development strategies needed to underpin all the development potential of the marine resource. We have already made a quantum leap in Irish marine research and development. Further strategies and funding support will be geared to delivering on the widely acknowledged potential for marine research and development to contribute to growth and jobs.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry has grown exponentially in recent years. It now represents some 30 per cent of the total value of Irish seafood output. The aquaculture sector has the potential to bring much needed further development to our remote coastal areas where economic development opportunities are often very limited. Aquaculture production will supply an increasing proportion of raw material for the Irish seafood processing sector. The support for the sustainable development of this sector is a critical priority in BIM's seafood industry agenda.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Byrne, has special responsibility for the aquaculture sector. He will address the House on the current state of play in the industry and our strategic economic objectives for its future sustainable development.</P>
    <P>I commend BIM for its strategy, which highlights the undoubted economic opportunities which a cohesive and innovative investment strategy can deliver for the sector. The BIM analysis accords with my own and is a critical contribution to the current debate on national investment priorities. I assure the House that I will be working with Government colleagues to secure the necessary investment support.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members of the Opposition for their support for this development and for the work which BIM has been doing. This is a major national resource and one in which all parties in the House are interested. It is one which we must develop. The competition for resources is stiff and the national priorities and challenges are many. However, we have set an ambitious and convincing agenda. It is my objective to try and deliver it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Fine Gael Whip, Deputy Barrett, to include the BIM document for debate in the Dáil. I did so with the primary <Col N="18" /> objective of focusing on BIM, the fishing industry and its importance. The Dáil has debated Agenda 2000 and the farming proposals on many occasions. Yet, the fishing industry has been regarded as the Cinderella industry and it has not received the recognition it deserves. It is important, therefore, to give the industry proper recognition and have it debated in the House. There is also a need to recognise BIM management who prepared this comprehensive document, almost as a blueprint for marine activities for the future. While I represent a rural community and understand agriculture, I appreciate the importance of fishing.</P>
      <P>The last round of funding was disappointing for the marine industry. Successive Governments have failed to get adequate funding to sustain the industry. To highlight this, it is estimated that in 1996 alone, EU and Government funding equated to £14,500 for each agriculture worker while the comparable figure for the fishing industry was £1,500. When it is considered that we have 5 to 8 per cent of EU catch levels, only 2.8 per cent of the tonnage of the total fleet and that we supply 3 per cent of the European market requirement it is clear that the common fisheries policy has not been a success for Irish fishermen.</P>
      <P>Under the operational programme for fisheries the fishing industry received only 1 per cent of all EU Structural Funds, or £75 million. This is unsatisfactory and it pales into insignificance when compared with the funding devoted to agriculture. The Irish seafood industry comprises fishing, aquaculture, processing and ancillary sectors employing approximately 16,000 people directly. Other spin-off activities raise this to approximately 25,000. If one allows for family dependence, nearly 60,000 people rely on the industry.</P>
      <P>The sales of Irish seafood are worth approximately £300 million annually with exports accounting for £228 million. The BIM document has proposed that £153.7 million should come from the EU and £44.8 million from Government funding. It also envisages private investment of £166.3 million. If one divides £44.8 million over seven years it becomes apparent that the level of Government funding required is small.</P>
      <P>The investment is to be focused in different areas. In the case of fishery harbours a total investment of approximately £60 million is envisaged. This is of vital importance for the long-term sustainability and development of our fishing fleet. Insufficient funding has been provided in the past and the infrastructural requirements of other fishery harbours have been neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BIM document outlines the necessity of providing this funding over the next seven years. For example, the two harbours of Killybegs and Castletownbere combined will require approximately 50 per cent of the funding to cope with appropriate infrastructural requirements. Killybegs is the premier port in pelagic fishing and Castletownbere is the premier port in white fish or demersal fishing. Killybegs, located in south-<Col N="19" /> east County Donegal, has an estimated 2,500 people depending on its fishing and related industries. It has approximately 44 vessels with approximately 24 in the pelagic fleet and 20 in the demersal fleet.</P>
    <P>The pelagic fleet is comprised mainly of modern and efficient vessels, but the demersal fleet is old and until recently there were no strong financial inducements to modernise it. The pelagic vessels have the scope to land their fish not only in Killybegs but also in Norway and Scotland. The location is often dictated by where the vessel is fishing at the time, the weather and price considerations. Pelagic vessels fish mainly for herring, mackerel and horse mackerel. The multi-annual guidance programme, under which the objective is to reduce EU tonnage, places severe restrictions on when new vessels are required and the equivalent appropriate gross tonnage must be taken out. As the Irish fleet is small, it is regrettable that this punitive regime operates where Irish vessels are concerned and it is only fair and equitable that this should apply to those who do most of the damage to our fish stocks. I hope the Minister takes this into consideration when the next multi-annual guidance programme is being negotiated.</P>
    <P>Although the Killybegs fishing fleet has improved considerably, there has been no significant improvement in the harbour facilities. Congestion is obvious and, as the quays are not designed to accommodate the current fleet, the quay space is inadequate for safe berthing and available water depths are not sufficient to accommodate large vessels in all tides. Estimates of the overall cost of these structural improvements range from £20 million to £25 million. This is vital to the Donegal region, much of which qualified for Objective One status. Appropriate funding for Killybegs harbour is required if it is to remain Ireland's premier fishing port.</P>
    <P>Castletownbere in County Cork is Ireland's premier whitefish port. While many parts of Cork are economically vibrant, the Castletownbere region is regarded as economically disadvantaged. My colleague, Deputy Sheehan, spoke on many occasions about the urgent necessity for parts of south-west Cork, which are economically disadvantaged and met the criteria, to be included in the Objective One area. He must be disappointed the area he represents was not considered for Objective One status. This is a glaring example of the injustices and anomalies that existed in setting the criteria to meet that status.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a vital economic activity in Castletownbere, where up to 500 people are employed in fishing and related activities. It is also a congested port with insufficient berthing facilities. Up to 80 per cent of fish caught are shipped, whole and fresh, directly to France and Spain. The remote location of Castletownbere was one of the factors that militated against the siting of a large processing industry in the area. The harbour is also used by Spanish, English and French traw<Col N="20" /> lers. It is estimated that up to £10 million will be required to fund the port's structural requirements.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that at least 50 per cent of the £60 million sought under this programme will be required for these two ports alone. Other fishing harbours also have justifiable claims for improvements in their harbour infrastructures. While £60 million might seem a large sum on paper, will it be adequate to cope with the developments which are required for those harbours, on which sufficient development funds have not been spent by successive Governments? As a member of Foynes Harbour Board for many years, I am familiar with what is being achieved by investment in commercial ports but, regrettably, that investment has not been mirrored in fishery harbours.</P>
    <P>The future development of the fish processing sector is linked to the future of the sea fishing sector. It is estimated that about 72 per cent of the Irish catch is brought ashore in Ireland. Most of the processing undertaken is of a primary nature and the opportunity to add value is reduced. The processing sector is plagued by poor availability and continuity of raw materials as a result of the common fisheries policy quotas and seasonality. Uncertainty as to availability of supply is a disincentive to innovation and investment. It is imperative that sufficient funds are made available to support added value production in the fish processing sector and for marketing and research and development to develop future market penetration abroad.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have focused on the marketing of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, as I am confident that with closer liaison between BIM and Bord Bia, which is responsible for the marketing of other food products, there could be greater market penetration for our fish products. I am pleased there are positive indications that these talks have been initiated and that they will bear fruit for fishermen in the future.</P>
    <P>In the past 15 years there have been great advances in the aquaculture area and it is now worth about £60 million to the economy. It is imperative to deliver on the commitment to provide funding of more than £27 million under the programme. This, along with private investment of more than £35 million, will give a great stimulus to aquaculture developments. Sources within the aquacultural industry indicate that it could be possible to have funding of up to £100 million for aquaculture over the next seven years, so great is their confidence that, between private, State and EU investment, even £60 million may not be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In the outgoing round of Structural Funds, in which Fianna Fáil played a pivotal role, more jobs were created in the areas of fish processing, fish farming and added value products for each ECU invested than for any comparable sector. It was regrettable, therefore, that sufficient funding was not provided for all these marine activities. As a result of the Govern<Col N="21" /> ment's attempts to advance this document, I hope we will get sufficient funding for the industry over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing fleet has about 2,100 vessels. When Deputy Barrett was Minister, he carried out an excellent review of the safety of the fishing fleet and revealed that there were safety deficiencies in up to 64 per cent of the vessels, about 60 per cent of the vessels were more than 20 years old and about 10 per cent of them were more than 40 years old. In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Woods, a successful fleet modernisation programme for the whitefish fleet is being implemented. It is imperative that the next round of funds provides for the continuation of this programme. I am pleased the BIM document recognises this is essential. I often wonder if there is a contradiction between trying to stimulate the industry with investment and continue the work the Minister has started and what the EU is trying to achieve in the multi-annual guidance programme in regard to restrictions on the fleet. I suppose the jury is still out on that. I wish the Minister well in the discussions. What the EU tried to achieve at the meeting in March would have had a severe impact on the Irish fishing fleet. The Minister must be extremely careful when the multi-annual guidance programme is being discussed in the future to ensure, as far as the Irish fishing fleet is concerned, the good work we have attempted in the past to bring the fleet up to par will not be undermined by what is being discussed at EU level.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry must operate under the EU common fisheries policy and the restrictions it imposes. The history of the CFP makes interesting reading. In 1973, the six original EEC states included fisheries in the agriculture brief. It was on 1 April 1976, April Fools Day, that fisheries got its own department in Brussels. It was only when Great Britain, Ireland and Denmark, all maritime countries, applied for membership that the EEC woke up and suddenly realised the importance of the fishing industry. Ireland suffered as a result of the regulations that were put in place which allowed equal access to all member states to each other's fishing waters. Norway has refused to join the European Union over the years, mainly because it would lose sovereignty over its waters. It appears to be a wise move on Norway's part because it has good fishing grounds, is renowned for its conservation policies and has a thriving fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In 1994 when Spain made it a condition for new members that it would have access to the Irish box off the south coast. Ireland, along with Great Britain, was hauled over the coals in Brussels and as a result we had to allow Spanish vessels access to our waters. Approximately 114 flagships fish off the coast. We have often asked how serious the Government was in its programme for Government when it promised to ban all flagships. If it is not serious, it should say that while it made that promise in its manifesto, it will not meet it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> Spain is probably the dominant fishery, with 20,000 vessels, and fishing is a central plank in its economy. Fisheries Council meetings are futile given that one expects all Ministers to have an interest in the fishing industry. However, Austria, which does not have fisheries or a navy, has voting rights in negotiations. I am sure Austria horse trades and barters with other member states for concessions in other areas of its economy. In December we will probably have the annual ritual preceding the fisheries meetings to agree the total allowable catch designated by scientists. Successive Ministers stated that they were going to Brussels for a hard battle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>When they returned, they hailed the negotiations as a success because the total allowable catch was retained or there had been minor improvements. There usually is a little give and take so that Ministers can return with concessions. However, that is par for the course and must be accepted.</P>
      <P>The Common Fisheries Policy has not been a success for Irish fishermen. Ireland is currently preparing for the next review of the policy in 2002 and it will be vital for our fishermen. There is already unanimity among many maritime states, with the possible exception of Spain and Portugal which do not have a proper coastal shelf, that a greater degree of regional control should be allowed. It is imperative for Ireland's sake that a fairer and more equitable system is achieved as the current regime is unjust and unfair. A great deal of discussion is taking place with regard to 2002 and, indeed, many organisations have made submissions. I want to be optimistic but Ireland did not do particularly well in previous reviews. Countries such as Spain and Portugal will adopt a strategy whereby they will probably look for even more concessions.</P>
      <P>I wish to digress slightly and refer to oil and gas exploration offshore, which comes under the Minister's remit. I accept his argument that under EU rules he cannot dictate policy on labour and services on rigs off the coast. We went over the jumps last year with regard to this argument. It appears that the battle with Enterprise Oil on the issue has been lost. The company began drilling in 1996 and hired Irish rig workers, whom it seemingly found satisfactory. Traditionally, these workers operated in a weather window which meant their work was seasonal and they worked out of certain ports. They are grievously disappointed that Enterprise Oil appears to have turned its back on them. It adopted a hardline attitude but could have given catering concessions which would not have made a great demand on the company and would have been a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I abhorred what happened in Foynes last year when pickets were placed on the port. It received a great deal of publicity because it was a nationwide SIPTU dispute, which was unfavourable to <Col N="23" /> this commercial port. I very much regret the pickets were placed and a service contract was lost. Enterprise Oil is drilling again this year and the Minister is very optimistic about its exploration work. The <i>Financial Times</i> reported that the last gas find off our coast was enough to service Ireland's gas needs, with enough left over to export to the UK via the interconnector. In September 1997 the Minister said that the find comprised the highest level of gas ever recorded in Irish waters. Enterprise Ireland is using Ayr as its main service base. I do not expect any change in its attitude to Irish rig workers who worked with the company in the past. I understand it will possibly use Killybegs to a limited degree and I hope that works out satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I am concerned because Enterprise Oil is a multinational company with partners such as Saga Limited and Statoil. Statoil is Norwegian and in that country it would not be allowed to get away with what it did here. Because Norway is outside the EU it can dictate that 70 per cent of a company's goods and services must be sourced there. A tax of up to 70 per cent is applied to exploration subsequently. As a result of Ireland's licensing terms, the equivalent tax here is 25 per cent. However, if the exploration is a success subsequently, companies will be able to divert their capital investment for tax purposes. I envisage that not alone will Enterprise Oil not use Ireland as a service base, it will also not pay taxes on the gas it finds because of the concessions that are in place. That is a regrettable scenario and I am surprised that Statoil, which has a thriving business, does not ask Enterprise Oil to move in a positive direction on this issue in order to create goodwill in Ireland, which is sadly lacking.</P>

Déanaim comhghairdeas le BIM agus molaim an bord as an phlean chuimsitheach seo a chur romhainn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from Donegal and fishing plays a hugely important role in the economy of the county. It provides more employment than most other industries there. If fishing is going well, the economy of the county is buoyant and if fishing is depressed or in difficulty, the county's economy suffers. I compliment BIM on publishing this plan. It is a comprehensive and imaginative blueprint for the future development of the fishing industry, which plays such a crucial role in the economy of peripheral areas of the west, including my county. This is the only plan to emerge for many years and I hope it receives the full support of the Government and the Minister. If the plan is implemented over the next five to six years it is estimated that it will create 3,400 much needed jobs in the marine sector, in areas of high unem<Col N="24" /> ployment in the west. It is significant that 62 per cent of the total envisaged investment of £365 million will go to the Objective One regions of the west, the north-west and the Border counties, where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>The plan has a number of different headings. The first is fisheries development, which means the modernisation and renewal of the fishing fleet. This is essential because we have one of the oldest fishing fleets in Europe and it is in urgent need of renewal.</P>
    <P>The second heading is the development of our fishery harbours and it goes without saying that this too is urgently needed to provide the infrastructural requirements to underpin this development. I spent last Friday in Killybegs, viewing the port from the land and the bay &ndash; I went out in a small boat as far as St. John's Point Lighthouse. There is serious congestion in the port at present because it is not able to facilitate the existing fleet. The Minister is well aware of the plans to develop the port, which I have seen also.</P>
    <P>Not alone will the plan sustain the fishing industry and aid its further development in Killybegs, it also has a commercial dimension. There are reserves of gas and oil off the north-west coast and Killybegs would be ideal for supporting off shore energy exploration. The cost of the plan is estimated at £20 million and we await a commitment from the Government and other agencies so that the development can go ahead as soon as possible. The plans are detailed and a great deal of work has gone into them. All we are waiting for is the green light from the Department.</P>
    <P>The third part of BIM's plan is the development of aquaculture. This has tremendous potential and contributes considerably to employment and income in the west. I hope it can be further developed because we still lag far behind other European countries. I went to Scotland last year to see what was happening there and we are well behind them, not to mention the Scandinavian countries. Aquacultural development should be balanced and responsible and we should not overlook the environment. We can learn from the mistakes of others when developing that sector.</P>
    <P>Under the fourth heading, fish processing, the plan recommends the use of the most modern technology from the viewpoint of safety and hygiene. Everyone would agree with that. The fifth heading is market development and the sixth is human resource development. There are many long-term unemployed people in the west and if we are to develop the sector we should draw on this group. Some of them would have a natural affinity for this area and would possess the skills. They are brought up in coastal areas and it would not take much training to make them sufficiently skilled to participate in any new employment created.</P>
    <P>The seventh heading is the ice plant programme. It is essential to have a well-equipped, modern ice plant in every port, in the interest of hygiene and to provide the best quality fish for the international market. A huge market is avail<Col N="25" /> able. In Europe we are used to having a surplus of most commodities &ndash; beef, butter, milk, cereals, etc. &ndash; but we were only 74 per cent sufficient in fish supplies in 1988, and that fell to 52 per cent sufficiency in 1998, a huge drop over that period. There is growing reliance on fish imports into the EU, which shows the potential of the industry. No matter how much we produce we will never be subject to quotas because there is a huge deficit and demand greatly exceeds supply.</P>
    <P>If this plan is to be effective it must get Government support. It will generate investment of £365 million, £199 million of which will come from the EU and national Governments and the rest from private investors. If that level of money is spent in our peripheral regions, from Donegal to Cork, it will provide a great economic boost. I ask the Minister to give the plan total support for the sake of our peripheral areas, which have endemic high unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the BIM Seafood Industry Agenda, 2000-2006. This is probably the best document in the history of the Irish fishing industry and I record our gratitude to the authors of the report. One can imagine the hours of research and work which went into it. The report is practical, simple and effective. If this Minister or one of his successors were to succeed in developing the industry this would be the blueprint for its future, even beyond 2006.</P>
      <P>One could virtually read the report into the record and not need to say much else but I will mention one element. We tend to be parochial in our contributions but my example is parochial because it is the one I know best. Clogherhead is the main fishing port in my constituency, County Louth. The village and surrounding area depends on not only fishing but fish processing. For as long as I have been a member of Louth County Council, more than 25 years, we have tried to encourage various Ministers to take an interest. Ministers from all parties came to Clogherhead by sailing boat, helicopter and aeroplane, usually prior to elections, and all promise to do various things for the port. Nothing has happened yet, and the reasons for this are in the report. That port, like many others around our coast, is controlled by a local authority and harbour development is low on the council's list of priorities. Local authorities can only provide funding for harbour development by levying it from ratepayers and few of these people live in rural coastal areas. Therefore, the general population of each county would be obliged to fund harbour development because the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources refuses to take responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met officials from the Department on a number of occasions in Clogherhead. I discovered that they held a simple view of the situation when they informed me that they could not spend £2 million on developing the harbour &ndash; it would cost £8 million if the job was to be done properly &ndash;<Col N="26" /> because the tonnage of fish landed at the port was insufficient to justify the cost. How can the industry increase the tonnage of fish landed at Clogherhead or harbours in Cork and Donegal if adequate facilities are not provided? It is a chicken and egg situation; the tonnage landed cannot be increased if the requisite facilities are not in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I are neighbours and he is aware that the fishing fleet from Clogherhead is obliged to dock in Drogheda &ndash; I made arrangements in that regard when I served as chairman of the port authority &ndash; or in ports in north County Dublin. The fleet cannot dock at Clogherhead because the necessary facilities are not in place and the boats are obliged to travel 30 miles to Drogheda or to dock on the west coast. The industry cannot be developed if the necessary tools are not provided. I accept that I have offered a parochial example but it is the one with which I am most familiar. I am sure Deputy Sheehan will highlight similar situations in County Cork.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I said during Question Time recently, namely, that sufficient money is not being invested in our secondary ports. Our efforts have been concentrated on developing the fishing industry and fish processing in the major ports and their smaller counterparts are treated as second class.</P>
    <P>As stated on previous occasions, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is the Government's &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; Department. The Department of Defence used to hold that honour but it has since been upgraded, and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has taken its place. I intend to cast no reflection on the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Woods, who has put his heart and soul into his work. However, successive Governments have totally neglected his Department for many years.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources lacks the financial resources, adequate personnel and expertise required to deal with a modern industry that holds great potential, particularly in terms of creating employment. At a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts I stated that the Department requires a huge injection of capital and manpower to bring it up to standard and ensure that it is promoted from the second to the first division of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>In current circumstances the Department is not in a position to deliver the services which will guarantee the further development of the marine and natural resources industries. In the interests of developing a lucrative marine industry which would create jobs and contribute to the further expansion of our economy, the Government must provide adequate funding and treat the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources seriously. Given half a chance, the Department has the potential to make a major contribution to the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> The BIM report on the fishing industry offered a number of heartening predictions and stated that the industry would move from strength to strength, provided it is given proper support and resources. It has been estimated that fish farming will outstrip global beef production in 12 years' time, which illustrates the importance of supporting the industry in Ireland. If it was the IFA who represented the fishing industry, fishermen would be protesting on the streets of Dublin every week and the Government would listen to their demands. With the exception of the IFO, its representative body, the fishing industry does not have the same kind of muscle or offer the kind of voting potential as the farming community. If it did, we would not be discussing under-resourcing.</P>
    <P>If Ireland is to gain its fair share of worldwide fish production, action must be taken to support the industry. As it stands, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has only one fish pathologist who is charged with inspecting the entire fish production industry. A guarantee of quality produce is an essential marketing point, but we simply cannot offer any such guarantee because we lack the manpower to do so.</P>
    <P>In terms of wider maritime issues, it is not only the fishing industry which is important. Sea transport, heavy industry and tourism have major potential. We must adopt a co-ordinated approach instead of concentrating on one element. Last month, the Dáil passed legislation extending Irish coastal waters by a further 200 miles. In light of this, it is crucial that we have the ability to ensure that our seas are not left open to pollution and mismanagement. It is also vital that we should be in a position to deal effectively with pollution, which will become an even more important issue in the future. As it stands, the only surveillance of our coastal waters is carried out by the Navy and the Air Corps. That surveillance is not sufficient, particularly in light of the growth of the fishing industry and the plundering of this natural resource by the bandits of the sea. This matter must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I could speak at greater length on this issue but our paramount concern today is to discuss BIM's excellent report. I again commend and congratulate BIM on its publication. As long as I serve as my party's spokesperson for the Marine and Natural Resources, the report will be my Bible. I hope the Minister will also treat it as such.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the opportunity to discuss BIM Seafood Industry Agenda 2000-2006 and congratulate BIM on a very fine publication. This is an excellent and timely opportunity to review recent important developments in the sector and to update the House on our strategic approach to developing the acquaculture industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate BIM on its seafood industry agenda. This strategy highlights the tremendous <Col N="28" /> potential for the development of the seafood sector of the economy. It is noteworthy that the vital role acquaculture is playing and will play in the future in terms of jobs, growth and value added is particularly evident.</P>
    <P>The industry has come a long way to a point today where it has established itself as an international producer of very high quality products that are competing successfully in the very competitive European market. The industry is now poised and eager to undertake further expansion and to play a key role in the development of the seafood sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government's overall strategic objective for acquaculture is to deliver sustainable development that will maximise the industry's contribution to the national economy and, in particular, to jobs and economic activity in coastal communities. I cannot stress strongly enough the importance of developing this economic potential in our isolated coastal areas. Living in such an area and having visited many such areas, I can assure the House the people of the county involved are very pleased to see economic development in areas where otherwise jobs could not be created. It is very difficult to attract foreign industries to remote rural coastal areas.</P>
    <P>In 1980 total acquaculture production in Ireland was under 6,000 tonnes with a value of only £1.9 million. These levels have increased exponentially over the years to a position in 1998 where total acquaculture production amounted to more than 39,000 tonnes with a first sale value to the economy of more than £60 million.</P>
    <P>This level of production now accounts for 30 per cent of the volume of Irish fish production and it has established aquaculture as an increasingly important supplier of raw material to the processing sector. This increase in production in a period of less than 20 years, which is in the region of 3,000 per cent in terms of value, was underpinned by a number of EU assisted programmes.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we take the operational programme for granted. I, the Department and the fishing industry are pleased these programmes have given such assistance from 1990 onwards and I hope that will continue up to 2006. The Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999 is currently in place. The programme's aims of strategic growth, development and job creation are being achieved through supporting continued sustainable expansion of output, increased productivity, improvements in competitiveness, marketing support and technology transfer. Under this programme to date, almost £11 million of EU grant aid has supported £31.5 million in total investment involving 117 projects encompassing all facets of the aquaculture sector. A further final tranche of projects under the programme will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Údarás na Gaeltachta are the implementing agencies on the ground in terms of supporting and driving projects under the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> Take up of available funding has accelerated significantly since the new legislative framework for licensing came into effect. At this stage demand outstrips the remaining funding available under the programme. This in itself is indicative of the substantial scope and capability for expansion and highlights a new level of confidence in the Irish aquaculture industry.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive licensing regime now in place to regulate the operation and development of the aquaculture industry has been a key development. This new framework is already facilitating a reduction in the backlog of licence applications that had accumulated over many years. The new licensing arrangements have given the industry stability, a firm legal footing and created a solid basis for the aquaculture sector to realise its full productive potential.</P>
    <P>Sustainable development of the acquaculture sector is predicated on best practice in terms of environmental standards. The new licensing arrangements are obviously critical to underpinning those high standards and confidence in the industry. I am confident that the backlog will be dealt with by the end of this year. Much attention is being given to licensing arrangements because of the difficulties experienced over many years.</P>
    <P>Many challenges and opportunities are facing the acquaculture sector. To ensure a cohesive partnership approach to tackling these challenges, I established the Aquaculture Forum, which brings together all key players from the sector, the agencies and the Department. I am pleased to advise the House the forum is delivering, in a businesslike and constructive way, in terms of progressing the key strategic issues confronting the sector.</P>
    <P>Last year I commissioned a strategic study of the Irish aquaculture industry to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and to make recommendations on future strategies for the medium term. This in-depth analysis of the sector was undertaken in consultation with the industry and all relevant agencies. The analysis is now being finalised and I confirm it complements the recommendations and targets identified by BIM. Key considerations for the future are the importance of achieving critical mass in annual production, which is essential for competitiveness, value added and market penetration. This study, which I intend to publish shortly, will critically inform thinking by the sector as well as the agencies on the medium to long-term development and investment strategies.</P>
    <P>BIM highlighted the case for technical and advisory support to underpin continued sustainable expansion of the aquaculture sector to deliver jobs, output and exports and best practice in environmental and quality management. The objective of the strategy is to underpin incremental growth to 68,000 tonnes with an output value of £123 million per annum by 2006. The target is to generate more than 1,700 new jobs in the sector. This will be vital to retaining the economic <Col N="30" /> well-being of coastal communities. I cannot over stress the necessity to provide jobs and to keep alive the fabric of rural life in such communities.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the development of the Irish aquaculture sector to date has been to grow production levels and exports of the traditional economic species of salmon, trout, mussels and oysters. We are now moving into the next phase, which will see increased focus on value added, diversification into new species as well as reaching critical mass. This is in line with global trends in the aquaculture industry.</P>
    <P>The market for seafood is at an all time high worldwide and all indications are that market demand for seafood products will continue to increase over the coming years. I want to position the aquaculture sector to maximise those growth market opportunities with all necessary investment support. I am firmly convinced of the potential and that the aquaculture industry will truly come of age in the next few critical years.</P>
    <P>I applaud BIM's excellent strategy document which is grounded on commonsense. It was produced by an organisation that has an acknowledged expertise of the sector in addition to a genuine understanding of the needs of coastal communities. Kilmore Quay in my constituency has first hand experience of this. It has a new ice plant and refitted mobile training units where training is provided in regard to imports. Added to that, there are about 400 people involved in the industry directly and indirectly in the Kilmore Quay area. Kilmore Quay is alive and well, and is an example to many other areas around the coast.</P>

      <P>I will take the credit for that, Deputy. However, we are also looking after Cork. I congratulate the excellent hands-on chairman of BIM, Mr. Patrick Ridge, who has a background experience in the food industry and Mr. Pat Keogh, the chief executive of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, who is a very committed person. I also commend the board of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which comprises very committed people, all of whom have a tremendous interest in the industry. BIM's aquaculture development staff are led by a very dedicated manager, Mr. Donal Maguire.</P>
      <P>Further major investment is necessary to develop the aquaculture sector, as has been mentioned by all speakers so far. We are in a difficult funding environment with many competing demands being made for various levels of funding. However, the case for aquaculture has been identified by BIM. The Minister, Deputy Woods, I and BIM are determined to get a good deal for the sector because of its potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU is only 50 per cent sufficient in fish food, which is a remarkable statistic. Developments are taking place, however. Only recently I was in Deputy Sheehan's constituency, laying a foundation stone for a factory for Bantry Bay Mussels, which I am pleased to say will be opened <Col N="31" /> in a few months' time. Next week I will travel to Fastnet Mussels to open a factory there. It is a time for good news of such developments. In conjunction with the forum, licensing provides clear indications of my intent to ensure that aquaculture will provide jobs and wealth in areas where jobs might not otherwise be created.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture is a positive development. It is people friendly and environmentally friendly. However, we need to promote this message and we are doing so. Recently I unveiled an interpretative sign in Bantry which tells of the history of the bay area generally, including the history of fishing there and the location of aquaculture enterprises. It emphasises the role that such bays have played historically in the economic development of such coastal areas. More such signs are on the way and in the near future I hope to unveil one at Bannow Bay in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture is a good news story. I look on the problems facing me as challenges that can be overcome because the prospects are so great. Like the rest of the fishing industry, aquaculture has enormous potential for wealth and job creation. I assure the House that as long as I hold this position &ndash; and I expect to be in office for another 15 to 20 years, at least &ndash; I will drive the industry towards achieving its full potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Bord Iascaigh Mhara's seafood industry agenda for the period 2000 to 2006. It calls for the commitment of £153.7 million funding from the EU, or 42 per cent of the total; £44.8 million from the Exchequer, or 12 per cent; and £166.3 million from private enterprise, or 46 per cent. The breakdown of this expenditure is as follows: £65 million for vital infrastructure and project development relating to harbours and on-shore facilities; £104 million for fishing fleet renewal, fisheries development and diversification; £63 million for aquaculture development; £100 million for fish processing; £9 million for market development; and £14 million for training. The total investment proposed over the seven year period is £365 million, or less than 1 per cent of the national plan. It is a very modest and prudent request for a natural industry with such vast potential. The combined State and EU funding sought is only £28 million per annum for the seven year period. I regard this as peanuts. It is not enough to keep the fishing industry afloat.</P>
      <P>Without the proposed investment the industry will not survive. This is the last chance we have to safeguard the one and only natural industry that has no quotas and no production limits. It has a huge market, both national and international, as well as a big future in terms of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am dubious about the amount of money we are seeking &ndash; only £28 million per annum &ndash; from the EU and the Exchequer over the next seven years. Ever since we entered the EU the fishing industry has been treated as the hind tit industry as far as EU aid is concerned. Subsidies <Col N="32" /> or grants of any consequence were not allocated to it. We have the oldest fishing fleet in the European Union. We have 13 per cent of the EU's fishery waters but only 5.8 per cent of its catch. All this must change if our fishing industry is to survive.</P>
    <P>Of the 60 main aquaculture locations around the coastline of the Republic, 30 are situated in the Objective One area, while the remaining 30 are located in the Objective One region in transition. Some 68 per cent of the £365 million envisaged for the next seven year programme from 2000 to 2006 will be spent in the western Objective One region. That amounts to £250 million of the total. The remaining 32 per cent, or £115 million, will be spent in the eastern region which embraces an area from the Aran Islands to Bannow Bay in County Wexford. This is the greatest injustice perpetrated on the Irish people, particularly those in the Aran Islands, Clare, Kerry and south-west Cork, since the Cromwellian era. There is not one affluent area on that coastline. How can any Government impose such a harsh division on a disadvantaged region with a poor, struggling population? That region has 50 per cent of the country's aquaculture locations and has the most natural waters in the country for aquacultural production because it is washed by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan before us does not bear that out. We are getting only £115 million of the £365 million, and that is for a stretch of coastline from the Aran Islands to Bannow Bay in Wexford. The Minister of State should know where Bannow Bay is.</P>
      <P>The waters in that region are the most suitable in western Europe for aquaculture production, yet it is not getting the recognition it should get. I am dubious about the effect this plan will have on the development of aquaculture in my area. Bantry Bay, a happy hunting ground for me, is the recognised capital of the Irish mariculture industry. However, the diversification of the proposed funding to the Objective One area during this seven year period will have a negative effect on the aquaculture industry from the Aran Islands to Cape Clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the contribution of the Minister of State to the aquaculture industry since taking office. He has at least focused attention on a worthwhile industry and I do not doubt he has the spirit and determination to redress the anomaly I have pointed out. I call on him to allocate an extra £35 million over the seven year period in order to bring our share of this development up from £125 million to £150 million. I call on him to ask the Exchequer for an extra £5 million for each year of the seven year period. That is a very modest sum. The Minister of State has the power and the means to influence the Minister <Col N="33" /> for Finance and to get that extra funding for the area designated Objective One in transition. That area will be stifled and starved for lack of finance for this valuable industry. It is only £5 million a year for the seven year period, and given the remarkable growth we have had with the Celtic tiger, I cannot see why any Government would not allocate that extra funding to the region which has the brightest prospects of keeping aquaculture alive.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State does that he will restore confidence in the seafood industry in that area, which includes such remote areas as the Beara, Muintir Bháire and Mizen Head peninsulas, the peninsulas of Kerry and Clare, Wexford and the Aran Islands. I fear that those areas will not be catered for by this plan when 68 per cent of the funding is to be derogated to the Objective One area and the remaining 32 per cent is to go to the Objective One in transition area.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister of State's plans for the expansion of tuna fishing? This is very valuable for fishermen on the south-west and Donegal coasts, and it is important that we get the best deal possible from the EU to explore and expand tuna fishing. The development of ports such as Castletownbere and Baltimore is also of paramount importance to the fishing and aquaculture sectors. Since being elected 18 years ago I have asked those in the Department of the Marine, Taoisigh on the Order of Business and Ministers in debates for one modest act: the removal of the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> from the mouth of Castletownbere harbour. It is a small matter and £200,000 would have done the job, yet after 15 years of my pleading for its removal, that wreck is still there. It is a danger to life and limb. What can one expect from a Department that has failed to remove a serious obstacle from the mouth of one of our premier fishing harbours? It is only by the will of God that a serious accident has not occurred there.</P>
    <P>Baltimore harbour is classified by the Department of the Marine as a recognised port for herring landings, yet the demands of the Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Board for adequate funding have been ignored by the Department. I impress upon the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources the need to upgrade Baltimore harbour in keeping with its position as an official herring-landing port. The development of Baltimore harbour would cost less than £7 million, a small amount compared with the levels of EU money spent on harbours in France, Spain and Portugal. The Irish marine industry does not seem to be getting its fair share of European funds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods says his strategic objective is to ensure a sustainable and vibrant future for the seafood industry and the communities it supports, backed up by the necessary level of funding to underpin investment after the year 2000. I hope the Minister will put his ideas into practice. He is an energetic Minister but when negotiating in Europe, he must emphasise that fishing is our <Col N="34" /> second most valuable industry. We have only three natural industries, agriculture, fishing and tourism. We do not contribute to the wine lake, the citrus mountain or to any other European production excess.</P>
    <P>Since the construction of the Channel tunnel, we are the only island nation in the Community. It costs us 100 per cent more than it costs other member states to place our food produce on the tables of Europe. Therefore, we should demand additional funding for our natural industries. Ireland has been a member of the EU for 26 years and in that time our fishing industry has not received its rightful share of Community funding.</P>
    <P>Since my childhood, I have seen Spanish, French and German trawlers marauding our fishing stock off the south west coast of Cork. It is disgraceful that this has been allowed to happen for so many years. We appear to be powerless to stop this practice now, because we did not use all the power at our disposal to protect the marine industry when we negotiated our entry into the EU. The Minister has received the report of the task force on the herring industry. What is the future for herring fishing in Ireland? Is the Minister aware that German producers are selling herrings in brine, in wine, in beer and in mustard on Irish supermarket shelves? We have failed to capitalise on the potential of the herring industry. What are we doing to market our smoked herring fillets?</P>

We should explore the possibility of developing a herring canning industry because unprocessed herring commands only rock bottom prices.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister and the Minister of State will show the spirit, the courage and the initiative to develop this important natural industry. I hope my plea to them does not fall on deaf ears. I ask only for an extra £7 million per year for an area which has been neglected because it has not been granted Objective One status.</P>

      <P>This is one of the country's most important issues. It is now understood that when we joined the EEC in 1973, we vastly underestimated the value of our coast and many feel that our fishing industry was sold out at that time. The role which fishing should have played in our economic development was hindered from that time and although Ireland has 13 per cent of EU marine territory, compared with 2.2 per cent of its land territory, we have only between 5 and 8 per cent of total allowable catches. Irish fishermen were casualties in 1973 and even now, the question of fishing is rarely given its appropriate place in the House or outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on securing time for statements on this subject. I concur with the sentiments expressed by Members. I congratulate Bord Iascaigh Mhara on the great work it is doing for the fishing industry and particularly on the report before us. Much time and effort has been put into the preparation of this concise, yet comprehensive document.</P>
    <P>I support the objective of BIM, set out in the report, to achieve a major increase in EU and national funding for the development of the Irish seafood industry in the new millennium. As BIM points out, the long-term prosperity of the industry, its unique ability to sustain regional and coastal communities and its ability to generate added value is dependent on critical supply-chain and infrastructural weaknesses being addressed and the development of market-driven processing enterprises of scale. We must look to the new millennium with a positive attitude. If we look to the past, we see only neglect.</P>
    <P>The present team of the Minister, Deputy Woods and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne have done more than previous Ministers by, for example, establishing the £3 million fund to deal with the infrastrucural weaknesses of small piers, harbours and slipways. Much remains to be done because the fishing industry must move from its present extremely low level. This is particularly true of the areas of deprivation outlined in the map on page 4 of the report.</P>
    <P>It is essential that investment be made available. While finding money is always difficult, the amounts outlined in the report are justified or even, as an earlier speaker remarked, possibly underestimated. Investment of the level outlined in the report is justified for many reasons.</P>
    <P>In an island economy such as ours, the development of fishing and aqualculture is fundamental to balanced regional progress. In County Donegal, where fishing, farming and textiles are our three core resources, we rely on a variety of marine-based enterprises. Fishing has generated essential employment opportunities, as can be seen in Figure 2.1 on page 22 of the report, and economic wealth for many people. The map on page 4 shows Greencastle to be one level above most of the rest of Inishowen in the deprivation score, although it is still only on the second lowest level. The marine sector has massive potential for job and wealth creation if investment is encouraged.</P>
    <P>By their nature, fishing activities are coastal based. On the day the report was launched there was talk of bringing product inland to be processed to spread jobs around. This would result in extra costs. The necessary facilities are available along the coastline. There is an advance factory in Moville which has been vacant for well over 20 years. It was adapted specifically for fish processing, but has never been occupied. It could be used to add value to product.</P>
    <P>When I look at the coast of Donegal I see a startling picture of deprivation. It is an area in <Col N="36" /> which the people must rely on marine enterprise. As a person who lives on the coast, investment is justified as there are so few economic alternatives. Increasingly, farming is incapable of providing a livelihood. We are struggling to retain existing textile factories and attract alternative sustainable industries. I trust this will change.</P>
    <P>Ireland deserves a dispersion of socio-economic development. Much of the thrust of policy appears to be directed at the main centres. We are all aware of the difficulties in Dublin, including the shortage of accommodation and traffic congestion. If we continue as we are, we will have a number of &ldquo;small Dublins&rdquo; at the expense of the rest of the country. This cannot be allowed to happen. Support for marine activities is the way to address the severe imbalance to ensure rural Ireland does not suffer the difficulties of depopulation and the cycle of deprivation it creates.</P>
    <P>The issue can be examined in two ways. One can decide the fishing sector has a future and invest in it to enable it realise its potential. In doing this one would help to create jobs. To this end one should support the expansion of the national training centres to ensure a supply of highly qualified and safety conscious skilled workers to match those in any other country. In this context, the fishery centre in Greencastle seeks support. One should also rebuild piers, harbours and slipways that are scars on the countryside and turn them into vibrant and attractive locations for marine activity, be it commercial, social or tourist related. In this way one would ensure the long-term development of road infrastructure and that schools, shops, post offices etc. remain viable. The second option, which is easier, is to say there has been too much neglect to turn things around. We could turn our backs on coastal communities and, in turn, the many supporting structures reliant on the marine sector. The Minister and Minister of State have taken the first option. They recognise the potential of the sea and deserve our support in pursuing vigorously the case of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>For many years people have talked about what could, should and will be done. The Minister has produced the goods and delivered on the critical issues &ndash; the age profile of the fleet and the renewal of the whitefish fleet. The fact that so many boats were in the 25 to 50 year old category should not have gone unnoticed for as long as it did. The response to the scheme is appreciated. It does not provide a hand-out for those who have their hands out to receive it. It demands entrepreneurs within the trade who have not been found wanting.</P>
    <P>As BIM points out, the response to the scheme &ndash; investment of £60 million has been approved in the past six months &ndash; shows the industry has the enterprise and skills necessary to capitalise on new opportunities and is willing to invest in its long-term development. I wish all those involved with the six new boats in Greencastle every success and hope they have a safe and profitable future at sea, leading to continuity of supply of <Col N="37" /> quality raw material which, in turn, will have a positive impact on onshore activities.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are responsible and forward-looking. By proper management of our waters we have the potential not only to maintain what we have but to ensure an improved supply of raw material. The majority of fishermen in my area are part of the whitefish fleet. There is potential to maintain and expand the onshore facilities available in places such as Greencastle. I appreciate the employment that these plants offer.</P>
    <P>The development of aquaculture offers regions, such as the one I represent, great opportunities. There is a need to update the Foyle Fisheries Act of the early 1950s. For years those involved in the sector have waited for new legislation to meet their needs. The Foyle Fisheries Act makes no provision for the shellfish sector. Those who have tried to be enterprising with seed mussels have been kept on tenterhooks because of the lack of supporting legislation. I commend them on their patience.</P>
    <P>I realise the furtherance of this issue depends, in part, on the establishment of the Executive in the North. I hope there is a speedy conclusion. My constituents have a future in aquaculture and seek the Minister's active support in ensuring its potential is realised, not only in terms of the primary product but also the value added aspect. There is a great need for a Foyle Commission office in Inishowen given, among other reasons, the cross-Border nature of the endeavour and the fact that the vast majority of fishermen who use the river are from east Inishowen.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for providing support for Carrickarory Pier which until recently remained in the hands of the Londonderry Port and Harbour Authority and was a blight on the landscape. The relatively small sum provided will ensure the pier will be operational again by July providing a base for the aquaculture sector. Moneys have also been provided for Portmore, Portronan, Bonagee and Portaleen, some of the most deprived rural communities in the country.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may, justifiably, rub his hands and feel satisfied, this should be only a start. We are starting from a low base and there is substantial room for improvement, whether in Moville where a 200 year old pier was replaced by a modern Office of Public Works cement structure and collapsed within a year, Queensport where there is an urgent need for blasting and dredging to accommodate the vast array of activities being pursued in Greencastle not to mention the proposed car ferry or six new boats, Leenan Pier which is in a state of bad repair or Buncrana harbour where many proposals for development are being pursued. A number of slipways equally deserve a mention. The investment will mean that produce can be handled and landed much more efficiently. This links in with BIM's vision of the future.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the resolution of the licensing issue on the Foyle. I also look forward to the <Col N="38" /> planned and balanced development of the Swilly. I believe, as does BIM, there is a possibility of doubling the value of the aquaculture sector in the immediate future. BIM cites the way forward as being through developing largescale value-added businesses capable of operating in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>Although this is an island, it is surprising that the consumption of seafood is not higher than it is. When one visits a country such as Spain, one sees real seafood consumption &ndash; possibly much of that is our exports. We see a variety of products and various presentations and uses of such products, whether as small appetisers in a local pub or as part of a full seafood menu in a restaurant or hotel. There is considerable potential for the marketing of seafood in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The BIM report states that it considers the market buoyant and levels of consumption are on the increase. Surely, through a well delivered marketing plan, the healthiness and nutritional value of seafood, not to speak of the ease with which it can be prepared &ndash; although I am no chef &ndash; could be delivered to a population which is ever more conscious about health, nutrition and convenience. While Irish fish exports may have grown by more than 80 per cent to reach £228 million in 1997, we are not fully exploiting the home market. There is still room for a considerable blitz on that market.</P>
    <P>As was seen in the response to the renewal of the white fish fleet, many see the marine sector can offer a sound business venture. As BIM states, unlike agriculture, the seafood industry operates in a free market without price or direct income supports. As such, the fundamental business economics of the industry are sound.</P>
    <P>As an aside, I commend the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on the introduction of fish assist for those on a particularly low income. It is most welcome to many families who are not yet in a position to expand their fishing earnings.</P>
    <P>The report is encapsulated in the words &ldquo;the proposed development programmes place strong emphasis on sustainable, regional and coastal development, on employment protection and creation, on coastal environmental protection, on resolution of supply side structural weaknesses and on the creation of vital supply change linkages with distributors and retailers.&rdquo;  These objectives mirror the economic and social objectives of Agenda 2000 at national, regional and EU levels.</P>
    <P>In this respect, the logic of the argument jumps off the pages at people who have spent time in coastal Ireland. It will take people, groups or individuals, State or non-departmental, to work together to secure the aims and goals. I know the value of working together and that true success can be achieved through people, who are attempting to attain a common goal, communicating, planning and moving forward simultaneously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> I take this opportunity to thank the National Training Centre, individuals working in the marine area and the various fishing co-operatives on Inishowen which, as experts in their field, have been in the main fair about their needs and the manner in which they express them. They faced years of frustration in trying to get their message across.</P>
    <P>I congratulate officials in the local authorities such as the marine engineer in Donegal County Council, Frank McDonald. He has reacted to the wishes of the members of the council and the people of the county. People like Frank have ensured a full audit of the marine needs of the council were undertaken. He systematically pursued the compilation of reports so the message could be clearly sent to the Department on our immediate requirements.</P>
    <P>I look to the continuing help of the Department and the Minister for the future needs of Donegal and such counties. This report is clear in its presentation of areas of deprivation, areas reliant on fishing and those found to fulfil the criteria for Objective One status. The strength of the case we, as a county, have must surely be undisputed.</P>
    <P>I fully support the case for substantial funding to advance the BIM seafood industry agenda for 2000-06. I see justification for the investment which has been requested to provide infrastructure, including harbours, onshore facilities, fleet renewal, fisheries development and diversification, aquaculture development, fish processing, market development and-or training. It is the Minister's wish to see the advancement of the sector and while many others would be daunted by the scale of the work that needs to be undertaken, we can rely on the Minister and the Minister of State to do their best on national and European fronts because they have a vision of the potential that exists within the marine sector. We have the potential to save rural communities, challenge successfully for real shares in the market and deliver quality added value product with which the growing discerning customer will only be too delighted.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a tough life. It would seem to be almost a vocation when one watches boats head off for days at a time to the perils of the sea, leaving families behind. We in Donegal have had our share of tragedy. I sincerely want to see continued support so that fishing families who dedicate themselves to this most difficult job are, as far as possible, safe in their endeavours while at sea and accorded proper facilities to which to come home. In many cases, that is not there at present. I hope there will be a better future for the marine sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the time of day when one's thoughts turn to food. In one of Deputy Healy-Rae's more memorable comments, he pointed out that they have dinner in the middle of the day in Kerry, as do all the plain people of Ireland. In <Col N="40" /> Dublin, however, people have dinner at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. That was a very down to earth statement.</P>
      <P>I do not know if anyone referred to the desperate winter which fishermen have had to endure. Some did not earn a shilling for three or four months because the gales started in early October and did not stop until early March. Some fishermen did not get out for months &ndash; I refer to people with trawlers and not half deckers. In November I was asked by Dunmore East representatives to ask the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to give them some badly needed financial assistance, which farmers get when there is a problem with fodder or in the marketplace, but lo and behold they got nothing.</P>
      <P>A manager of a fishing co-operative society in Dunmore East said on local radio that Waterford needs a Deputy like Deputy Healy-Rae. The fool did not realise there is a much larger port than Dunmore East in Deputy Healy-Rae's constituency, that is, Dingle. The landings at the various ports are outlined in some detail in the Minister's document. Killybegs is by far the largest port and Castletownbere is considerable. Dingle is a sizeable port and Dunmore East is some way behind. When people make comparison, they should know what they are talking about. There are a few other smaller ports in Kerry South.</P>
      <P>The essence of the fishing industry centres around conservation &ndash; conserving existing stocks and building an industry on what is in our waters and, if necessary, further afield. That was not referred to in the Minister's speech. While we might criticise the European Union at times, it has made efforts to conserve stocks in recent years. Its scientific approach to the fishing industry is bearing fruit and achieving results. Certain fisheries need to be closed down or curtailed for the industry to survive.</P>
      <P>About 20 years ago the situation as regards herring stocks was so critical that herring fisheries were closed. There was uproar but as a result of the closure and conservation measures taken, fisheries have recovered considerably. Herring stocks, for example, are much stronger now than previously. We must be very vigilant in terms of conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times in the House I have said I cannot understand what has come over the Spaniards. Perhaps nothing has come over them and they have not changed. From time immemorial the Spaniards have been destroying fishing grounds in this country, killing undersize young fish, fishing with undersize mesh and fishing illegally. The Spanish have many licences to fish in our waters, but many more unlicensed boats are more often than not fishing in Irish waters. Some weeks ago I made a point to the Minister that in the first three or four months of 1998 literally dozens of Spanish boats were apprehended and prosecuted for illegal fishing while this year hardly any have been apprehended or prosecuted. I find it very hard to believe that the Spaniards have changed their ways. They are notorious and with due respect to the Navy, <Col N="41" /> which with limited resources does an excellent job, I wonder what has happened. It is like the big black hole we talked about years ago in terms of the economy. Have the Spaniards, the greatest sinners of all time in respect of fishing, repented or has somebody cast a spell over them and made them goodie-goodies all of a sudden? I do not believe they have changed. Our greatest problem is over-fishing and the damage being done consistently for many years to our fisheries by the Spaniards. The Spanish fleet is a multiple of the combined fleets of the other EU countries with probably ten times as much fish catching capacity as the combined capacity of all other EU fleets. One can imagine the extent of the damage done when Spaniards start illegal fishing and poaching in our waters. I wish somebody would tell me what has happened.</P>
    <P>A person in Brussels at this time of day would head for a fish restaurant where the fish is cooked so beautifully and presented so well that it would melt in one's mouth. Here one is hoping for a dinner of bacon, cabbage and potatoes, or perhaps stew. Children rush off looking for burgers, mixed grills, sausages and chips or food in McDonalds. Why is there such an extraordinary divergence in eating habits? We do not look for a fish product here but pursue it avidly when we go abroad. Unfortunately, fish is regarded almost as a secondary food by many people in this country. I know this is partly the result of Friday having been a day of abstinence. Many children served with fish would almost throw it back. A peculiar habit has developed in regard to our attitude to fish.</P>
    <P>Many restaurants, including the Dáil restaurant, have made great efforts to produce very high quality seafood meals. There has been a big improvement in this context in recent years, but McDonalds and other take-aways continue to prosper. We go abroad to Brussels and Paris on what the public call junkets, but what Members know as tedious hardworking trips when they will be on the go from 7.00 a.m. until 7.00 p.m. or 8.00 p.m. The one thing I always looked forward when I went abroad was the magnificent fish in fish restaurants. Most of the seafood was caught off our coast, be it shell fish, lobsters or the lowly periwinkle. Much of the time we are reluctant to eat such seafood, probably as a result of tradition. However, an improvement in the situation is evident.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the issue of harbours. Every harbour in the country is a potential industry. In the 1960s and early 1970s four major harbours, namely, Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere and Killybegs, were designated for development. These harbours were built up and generated many jobs. People bought huge fishing boats and the capital programme was a great idea. However, there has not been a significant capital programme of harbour development since then. We live in much more affluent times and we are not doing enough in this regard. Most of the harbours we are using are relics of the British occu<Col N="42" /> pation. Some were built during the famine while others pre-date that time.</P>
    <P>Good quality harbours right around the coast would generate many more jobs in the fishing industry. Dunmore East, one of the harbours included in the capital plan of more than 30 years ago, is far too small for modern needs. It is absolutely full when there are 70 or 80 fishing trawlers in the harbour. The people in Dunmore East want a sizeable marina, another huge money spinner. Ordinary people want to go out in sailing boats and pleasure craft and there is a sailing club in the area. A variety of activities must be facilitated in harbours. Harbours which were quite suitable 20 years ago are no longer suitable as they are far too small. Therefore, a capital programme is necessary to build new harbours and extend existing ones.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan is seeking £6 million or £7 million to get rid of the <i>Bardini Reefer </i>from Castletownbere. I am talking about a couple of billion pounds in terms of harbour development. Building a harbour probably costs £100 million or £200 million. However, harbours are necessary. Also, marinas are all the go nowadays. They attract tourists from Britain, the Continent and the Americas. We must facilitate these tourists and the development of marinas. We need facilities for a variety of activities which generate money and jobs. We are not forward looking in that regard. It is about time we thought big and developed those harbours.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister define the term &ldquo;aquaculture&rdquo;? Does it include fish farming?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The report makes the point, as did the Minister, that 30 per cent of all fish products come from aquaculture. Twenty five years ago the figure was not even 5 per cent. It is a major growth area and will account for 50 per cent before long. Places such as Arklow now farm valuable species such as turbot which we thought in the past could not be cultivated through fish farming.</P>
      <P>Sea and shore angling are not mentioned in the report and the Minister of State may say they are not within his brief or that of the Minister. Is serious attention being paid to this area because it is another tourist activity with great potential, particularly in the inland waterways. Tens of thousands of English and continental anglers were attracted to them years ago. That sector of the fishing industry has been neglected. While the troubles in Northern Ireland caused major problems, it is time we regenerated that element of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cast no aspersions on the Minister of State or the Minister when I say the previous incumbent, Deputy Gilmore, was the best I have seen in the portfolio in my 26 years in the Oireachtas. He was able to think for himself and got things done. For example, he sorted out the driftnet salmon fishermen, something at which all his prede<Col N="43" /> cessors balked. He showed initiative and had ideas. I would like the Minister of State to build on that, which I am sure he will. Let us give credit where it is due. There was a great deal of dead wood in the job over the years, but he was excellent. I would like to see that being built upon.</P>
    <P>Angling, whether it is inland, on the seashore or in boats, has much potential. It may not seem important in the context of the fishing industry, but if proper sewage treatment plants were built in all coastal towns and villages, there would be pure water on the seafront. People could then be encouraged to come angling because fish will come if the water is pure and suitable. Mackerel shoaled into the inner town harbour in Dungarvan last year for the first time in 35 to 40 years because an industry which was dumping acid and other dreadful waste closed. The quality of the water became good enough for fish to come inshore, and mackerel shoaling almost up to the beach is a sign that other fish, such as flatfish and flounders, are also coming in. Sea and shore anglers constitute a significant element of the tourism trade and fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State takes on board what I said about the building of ports. We are not thinking big enough. We have done nothing. Our predecessors in the 1960s would be ashamed of us because they had big ideas for the fishing industry. They started with four major ports which have been very successful and we have done nothing since. It is indicative of our interest in the fishing industry that, although there are 16 maritime counties and fishing should be a major industry, only eight Deputies are interested in taking part in the debate when there should about 50 or 60. That speaks for itself.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the BIM report. We now have a well researched document which gives an integrated approach to the development of the marine industry through partnership and professionalism. I agree with the previous speaker that, despite this being a maritime nation and isolated constituencies like mine being reliant on fishing, the industry is the Cinderella not only of the House but also of industrial development, although it has huge potential. The document sets targets which can be met, leading to increased job potential and export opportunities. Yet it is an industry which does not receive due recognition from the funding agencies, the State and the European Union.</P>

    <P>That said, it is high time the House took the initiative and, instead of speaking of the past, regretting what happened in discussions with the European Union on the Common Fisheries Policy and rehashing many of the arguments about quotas and access to fisheries which have already been debated <i>ad infinitum, </i>we should examine what we have, develop it to its truest potential and look forward to the renegotiation of the CFP. We should be seen to be developmental, and I <Col N="44" /> know the Minister and the Minister of State will do their utmost to support the development of the industry. I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on the initiatives they have taken in consultation with BIM, the industry and the Department, especially in recognising for the first time the development of the whitefish fleet. That is a commendable feature of a Minister's tenure in the House and has been welcomed in my constituency and nationally.</P>
    <P>The targets proposed by BIM for the development of the industry are peanuts. Money such as this would be spent by a Department within weeks on various projects. I support the efforts of the Minister and the Minister of State to ensure the necessary funding is made available, either through the European Union, given that many of the areas in which the industry is located have Objective One status, or through Exchequer funding being made available to the Department for the development of the programme.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from Donegal South I have told the Minister many times that the marine and fishing industries are the lifeblood of my constituency. Without the development of Killybegs and Burtonport, including the development of their harbours, fishing fleets, fish processing and ancillary services, County Donegal could probably be forgotten about. Yet we have not achieved the true potential which I believe is there, especially with regard to the development of fisheries, including the introduction of new species and the progressive renewal of the fleet and ensuring the safety of our fishermen while developing the potential of the fish processing industry.</P>
    <P>A number of matters were raised at a conference held by the Minister arising out of the terrible losses which we experienced in County Donegal and the establishment of a task force. These are reflected in the document. The Minister said that the targets for the development of the industry could be met in County Donegal. I am aware that BIM was involved in supporting the preparation of the Donegal marine plan.</P>
    <P>The physical infrastructure has been mentioned in this debate. An interdepartmental committee must be established between the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to ensure there is proper access to the ports. Aquaculture is developed away from main routes. Similarly, large and small ports are surrounded by county and regional roads. There is no access to national secondary or national primary routes. Anybody in the processing industry will confirm that time is money and if markets, especially fresh markets, cannot be accessed as quickly as possible without the necessity to stop for, say, lorry repairs, as happens on many occasions, the industry will run at a loss.</P>
    <P>Proper infrastructure development in the provision of water supplies and sewerage are also essential in providing access to our vital industries in the regions. I hope that in consultation with this document and in preparation of the national <Col N="45" /> development plan, these will be part of an integrated approach in providing proper physical infrastructure to the ports and harbours to which I refer.</P>
    <P>The other matter referred to in the document deals with harbours. I thank the Minister for copperfastening the KPMG report with regard to the development of Killybegs. He has made funding available for the survey and I know he is genuine when he says that a new harbour development will be made available in Killybegs for the development of fisheries and, I hope, the off-shore oil industry. We look forward to the day the Minister visits the area with a cheque and to the time when we can at last have a proper harbour in Killybegs.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for making funding available in consultation with the councils for the promotion and upgrading of the small fishery harbours around the country. There is a small but vibrant on-shore fishing industry. Many aquaculture developments rely on small harbours, especially those located in isolated areas. A proper development plan with the necessary funding for the development of harbours is necessary for the development of the fishing and aquaculture industries, where there must be safe access and birthage. Both industries need to be married to the oil and marine leisure industries. The latter has huge potential for the coastline. There is a need to ensure that industry and leisure work together in partnership.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry has been identified in this document and by the marine action plan as holding high potential for job creation. I agree with that and was pleased to note the recent introduction of legislation to deal with licensing in the aquaculture industry. There is potential for growth which can work in partnership with the tourism industry. There have been a number of objections to the licences that have been granted. Yet, without the aquaculture industry, County Donegal would have no jobs in many of its small villages, such as Inver, which the Minister knows well. The jobs in that industry are good, well paid jobs.</P>
    <P>I hope we will be able to ensure the development and potential of the aquaculture industry. We must consider an approach to its development which will not only address the need for increased tonnage of existing operators but will also, through a development plan, designate areas of potential aquaculture development which would not have a harmful effect on the beauty of my county or the country generally. Given the potential for the creation of 300 jobs in County Donegal, it is apparent that the industry needs support. However, the support should not only be financial. High levels of funding are required to research the potential of the industry, including the different species that could be developed. Indeed, given that the in-shore fishery industry has almost died out, and is potentially only a leisure activity from hereon, there is also a need to ensure that in-shore fishermen have the oppor<Col N="46" /> tunity to become involved in aquacultural development.</P>
    <P>The processing industry provides added value. A criticism I have encountered in recent years is the lack of funding to the fish processing industry. There are also criticisms that most of the fish processing industry in County Donegal is reliant on primary processing. However, even if this is the case, the industry must develop and adhere to severe EU regulations. There is a vital need to support and upgrade the facilities in Killybegs. Additional funding must be made available through IBM and Enterprise Ireland to ensure that the 30 firms operating in County Donegal have some support in recognition of the job creation they have developed over recent years. At present the industry receives no support, unlike the farming industry.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest concerns is the failure to move into secondary processing. I do not know why people are afraid to develop this area, especially given that a number of small groups have developed considerable added value to their product. There is a necessity for tutoring or support to ensure that they can move to secondary processing. Food which is not processed and requires more than, say, 20 minutes to cook will not be popular. Nobody today will gut fish to cook it, but they will buy it ready prepared and because of its health value. Therefore, we must look at the marketing strategy for the product and how we can invest in and market secondary processing. That is an area in which there is massive potential in Ireland. I do not know why we cannot produce the best food in the world, why we do not provide the best fish products ready for the table while we export to the Far East and the EU without generating additional value. The other countries generate that additional value for themselves and it is unfortunate we cannot do so.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in terms of the pelagic trade's reliance on the Japanese and Far East markets in particular in the past six months relate to the difficulties in the fish processing industry. There is a need to support the promotion of mackerel, in particular, in these countries where the market has been volatile. From talking to some of the processors in Killybegs, they have encountered severe difficulties selling their fish products and they have had to reduce their prices. I am concerned about the loss of part-time jobs in particular. I hope the State agencies will be in a position to support the industry to ensure we increase market development. I hope this is only a blip in the world economy. Over reliance on these markets may be detrimental to the industry. Therefore, we need to support new markets. That will have to be done in consultation with the industry and BIM.</P>
    <P>Another important matter addressed in the document is human resource development. Unfortunately, the fishing industry was seen as a fairly well paid job for six months of the year. Young people went into the industry without training and without regard for safety. The intro<Col N="47" /> duction of the school at Greencastle has changed that position. There has been little emphasis in the fishing industry on human resource development from the point of view of education. Although there is the potential of an institute of technology in Letterkenny and there are a number of VEC schools, there is no marine education available apart from that at Greencastle. We need to make available courses on safety requirements and work. If fishermen, in particular, and fish processors were unable to continue in such employment, it would be unacceptable that their educational qualifications would leave them with no career options. It is vital that the Department of Education and Science and the educational authorities in each county or constituency where there is a fairly vibrant fishing industry take on board the contents of the document. With aquaculture, which is a new industry, there is an absolute necessity to ensure that people are well versed on fish health, fish farming and market development. There is also a need to make available to people in the industry training, management and academic programmes to ensure it has a professional image.</P>
    <P>We must support the targets of the industry. That can only be done by ensuring there is investment in the industry. Current investment, which is paltry compared to that in many other industries, will generate huge returns in areas I represent which are rural and isolated and in which there is little potential for the development of industries other than marine related ones.</P>
    <P>I commend BIM on its professional approach. It is giving people simple messages. I hope the Minister obtains the necessary support from this House and from his Cabinet colleagues to ensure real investment in an industry which unfortunately has been known as the Cinderella industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt faoin tionscal iascaireachta inniu de bharr go bhfuil suim mhór agam ins an tionscal agus ins an shlí beatha a théann leis. Dár ndóigh, mar is eol don Teach, tá cónaí orm i mBaile Brigín i dtuaisceart Chontae Átha Cliath. Tá an-aithne agam ar roinnt mhaith de na h-iascairí i mBaile Brigín agus sna Sceirí ach go háirithe agus in áiteanna eile.</P>
      <P>As it is a fine day, many of us would relish the opportunity to be more closely associated with the fishing industry. This morning I spoke to a number of fishermen who are fishing at present. When I said it was a fine day, they said that the easterly winds mean it is not as fine as one on land might think. There is a great deal that many of us landlubbers need to do to make ourselves more aware of the vagaries of life as a fisherman &ndash; most of them are men although there are some honourable exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for the Government and BIM, whose report we are discussing, to make the fishermen far more aware of what is being planned for their future. For instance, none of the fisher<Col N="48" /> men I telephoned this morning were aware of this debate before I brought it to their attention, nor were they aware of the BIM report. We may wonder why that is so. The report is peppered with projections, percentages and figures, which is a credit to the statistician or the department of statistics at BIM, but unless the fishermen are fully aware of the largescale planning and investment in the fishing industry, they will be left wondering where they are going. If the fishermen are not aware of the future plans for the industry, it is not a good sign.</P>
    <P>I got the clear impression at yesterday's presentation, which I was glad to be able to attend and for which I thank BIM, that the future was in fish processing and aquaculture in particular. I was struck by the message, to which Deputy Deasy and Deputy Coughlan referred, that one needs to be aware that the future is in ready to eat meals. People increasingly want McDonalds-type fast food because they do not have as much time to prepare food as they did previously. This was put succinctly in the presentation as the CTT phenomenon, cannot cook, too lazy to cook or no time to cook.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that change is one with which the industry must be fully <i>au fait</i> and it must adjust to it, there is also a need to remind ourselves that unless fish stocks are healthy in terms of numbers and quality, long-term planning is little more than theoretical. I hope the point that we are planning with stocks in mind and giving due consideration to them will be made more forcefully.</P>
    <P>For example, I take closely to heart that 70 per cent of all our catch is exported to other member states. That creates a huge dependence within the industry on exports and results in a huge responsibility to ensure that each exported fish is of the highest quality. Given the experience of the beef industry, it only takes a number of rogue operators to put the entire industry in peril. Salmonella is a danger which crops up from time to time in discussions. The important aspect of investment and development in this industry is in close monitoring and the rigorous maintenance of the highest standards so that our exports are always 100 per cent beyond question.</P>
    <P>While I support strong Government investment, fishing, of all our indigenous industries, has not had the benefit of price supports which industries, such as agriculture, have had over the years. Investment must involve consultation with, and approval of, the fishermen.</P>
    <P>When I got to know the fishermen of north county Dublin, in particular, I was extremely impressed by the realism they brought to discussions on the industry. Having to face up to the harsh reality that conservation measures mean that fishermen could not fish as much as they would like, I found them to be the strongest proponents of such measures and they were looking to the future. They were urging the Government to take a tight grip on management of fish stocks.</P>
    <P>Many fishermen have a comprehensive knowledge of the seas and fish stocks and they need to <Col N="49" /> be brought into planning more than they have been. Officials in various Departments and fishing organisations say there is a lack of a tradition of co-operation among fishermen but that is an excuse. Whatever about the past, many good fishermen have tried to work with the Department and BIM and have, effectively, become fed up with bureaucracy and a lack of understanding of what they are talking about. They are lost to an important part of consultation and planning.</P>
    <P>I cite the regulation of razor clam fisheries as an example and I have raised it with the Minister every time I have met him. It is too late to discuss the issue in Italy and Portugal because such fisheries were wiped out or exploited to the point where it was not viable to harvest them. Has this lesson been learnt by the Department? Studies have been carried out but they seem to give rise to procrastination. I hope the Minister will be able to give me good news when he responds.</P>
    <P>The absence of regulation results in huge waste of investment by people interested in exploiting razor clam fisheries. They invest blindly because nobody in the Department told them how long the fisheries will be there, how many licences will be allowed, and under what conditions they will be required to operate. As a result there is an extremely large differential between the quantities caught. Some people invest to gain a short-term return while others look for a long-term return. As a result there is an enormous tension between the different interests involved. The Minister has a responsibility to quickly come to the rescue of those who have the long-term interest of razor clam fisheries at heart.</P>
    <P>Apart from monitoring and regulation, a great deal of what needs to be done in the fishing industry relates to marketing. If one asks anybody outside the House what they associate with the marketing of fish in Ireland, they might mention the tune of the BIM advertisement or Captain Birdseye. That may be unfair but there has been a lack of imagination in the marketing of fish and as a result Ireland has a low <i>per capita </i>consumption of fish in comparison to other European countries.</P>
    <P>I referred to the BIM presentation yesterday. A significant anniversary of relevance to the fishing industry is 13 June 1999 and it will capture the public's imagination. On 13 June 1699 Molly Malone, the best known fish seller in the world, died. She is remembered at every sporting event in Ireland. There is a sculpture of Molly Malone nearby and she was synonymous with the revival of the public's interest in the fishing industry. I ask the Minister and BIM not to let that opportunity pass. On 13 June there should be a significant marketing and media event to ensure we do not forget the day Molly Malone died and Monday 14 June should see the launch of the new era of fisheries, dedicated to her memory. This opportunity should not be lost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan mentioned another marketing opportunity which should not be forgotten. <Col N="50" /> Small harbours are neglected and the EU has concentrated on the larger harbours, such as Howth in the Minister's constituency. People who depend on smaller harbours feel they have been left on the scrap heap. Harbours like Balbriggan, Skerries, Loughshinny, Rush and Rogerstown have varying degrees of fishing activity. In Loughshinny it is concentrated on crabs whereas in Balbriggan and Skerries there is a large dependence on prawn fishing. Those areas benefit greatly from fishing.</P>
    <P>Under the Harbours Act the Minister is acting like Pontius Pilate. He is handing the harbours to local authorities, who have little if any experience of consultation with or management of the fishing industry. The Department must keep its hand on the tiller and provide its expertise, funding and guidance to local authorities so that the fishing industry in those areas is not damaged.</P>
    <P>Small harbours have wonderful marketing potential because they do not have the industrialised aspect of fishing which leaves many people cold. Terms like &ldquo;vacuuming the sea bed&rdquo; create an image of exploitation without any cognisance of long-term sustainability. That impression may be right or wrong &ndash; I hope it is wrong, otherwise we will have a difficult future &ndash; but the character and charm of smaller harbours are resources which will help in the revival of interest in fishing. The use of harbours by film crews, for instance, has done a great deal to increase awareness. The current release <i>Sweety Barrett</i>, starring Brendan Gleeson, was shot almost exclusively at Balbriggan Harbour, with the full co-operation of local fishermen. We talk about the film industry promoting tourism in Ireland and there is potential for cross-departmental involvement in promoting fisheries also.</P>
    <P>As an island nation, it would be strange if we did not make the investment sought by BIM. If we are to get the maximum return from that investment we must take into account the needs and interests of fishermen because they are working and risking their lives in the industry. We should be grateful for what they have done against great odds, both internationally and in dealing with our bureaucracy. I ask the Minister to ensure that consultation takes place and that BIM takes the fishermen's recommendations fully on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive and wide-ranging input to this debate and I welcome the positive response. A number of specific points were made and I will deal with these. I note Senator Tom Fitzgerald watching from the wings. He is concerned with his beloved Dingle and the south-west coast and has great interest in fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finucane raised a number of points and made a constructive contribution on the BIM document. Both sides of the House are taking a supportive approach and BIM can feel satisfied with this. It is an excellent document which charts <Col N="51" /> the way ahead. In the context of past events it is an ambitious document but it is timely and appropriate to our future actions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of the great investment in confidence in aquaculture and I agree with him that this needs to be supported. The way is clear to make progress because the legalities have been sorted out, the appeals board is in place and a balanced approach will be taken. I think this will move ahead soon. He regretted that not enough funding had been provided over the years and this is generally true. We are trying to reverse that with the support of both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned what in his view was the conflict between the EU approach and my approach to investment. Let us call it tension rather than conflict, although I appreciate the point. We must be clear where we are going, which makes this document all the more important because it makes clear where we stand, from the viewpoints of BIM and the Government. We will find ourselves continually in disagreement with the EU, in a constructive and democratic way.</P>
    <P>The NTP programmes are designed to control and reduce over-capacity in EU fishing fleets and we can all agree with that, so long as they are not talking about our fleet. That is what every country says. As Deputies said, we must recognise that our fleet is old for the most part, although we are modernising it, and quite small relative to the resources around our coast. When I served in this Department in 1992 I had rows with the EU about fleet reductions which it wanted us to make at that point. I was not prepared to do that and we actually increased the fleet at that time. We are due a reasonable share of the fish in the waters around us.</P>
    <P>The Commission acknowledges the need for a dual track approach, which is why I did not want a sleight of hand reduction where for every 100 tonnes of one type of fish one would have to find 130 tonnes of another type, such as in the recent proposals to which I was strongly, if not violently, opposed. In fairness to the Commission, its dual track approach involves reducing capacity and modernising at the same time. Obviously, it creates a great deal of tension but we will not be able to compete unless the industry is modernised. We must press ahead in that regard. The tension to which I refer is usually recorded in the media and Members are aware that I am obliged to work my way through such tension, which exists in individual countries and between countries.</P>
    <P>Member states' policies need not necessarily be contradictory because there is a structured approach to investment. Renewal and modernisation of the fleet is being achieved within capacity limits. We are seeking fair treatment in respect of those limits in order that our industry can be modernised. If our vessels cannot travel further out to sea, they cannot catch non-quota species or their fair share of other species and the indus<Col N="52" /> try will be put at risk. We want good, safe, well-equipped, modern vessels so that fishermen can go about their work without putting their lives unduly at risk.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane referred to difficulties involving flagships. Under the accession arrangements, only 90 Spanish vessels are allowed to be in Irish coastal waters at any one time. However, flagships, many of which are UK registered, are a different matter and must be dealt with separately. There are approximately 120 of these vessels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 114 of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Our objective is to control and monitor the flagships operating in our waters and to mount an effective ban on some of their activities. The right of establishment and the freedom of movement, which have been contested in court, have an obvious bearing on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are working with the UK authorities to ensure strict controls are put in place. We pass on any information we receive to our UK counterparts which has been a key element in the prosecution of the owners of flagships in the UK courts. The UK authorities are co-operating with us on that policy.</P>
      <P>In EU fishery policy terms, the concept of flagships is unsatisfactory. Flagships can fish against national quotas without necessarily being obliged to make restitution to the coastal communities in the areas where they operate. The strategy we have adopted involves using EU and national control mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane referred to a number of other matters. I find no fault with what he said in respect of oil and gas exploration. The IOOA has been trying hard to obtain a resolution to problems in this area. As everyone is aware, Norway is not a member of the EU and is in a strong position to dictate matters. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that a completely different set of rules govern the transfer of oil and gas onto land. It is unfortunate that an accommodation could not be reached and that last year's Foynes contract was adversely affected by the pickets placed on the harbour. There have been further repercussions this year in that regard. Someone must have gained satisfaction from the dispute to which I refer, but companies in Ireland now lack the confidence to put contracts out to tender as a result of what occurred. The ICTU and SIPTU will be obliged to give consideration to this matter because such behaviour is not <Col N="53" /> acceptable under the terms of any of the national agreements.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley referred to the importance of the fishing industry to County Donegal and the need to put in place a development plan. Deputy Bell welcomed the document which he sees as a blueprint for the industry. The Deputy spoke at length about Clogherhead, which is only natural. If he does not speak about it, who will?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The next commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bell referred to my Department as the Government's &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; Department, which it was in the past. The position has changed, but I accept there is still a long way to go. He also made the point that it was underfunded and understaffed, an observation with which I do not disagree. However, staffing levels and funding have been increased in recent times. Debates of this sort and the documents of the type under discussion indicate the value of the Department and the work it is doing.</P>
      <P>Deputies Coughlan and Keaveney highlighted the fact that Donegal would be forgotten if the fishing industry which is so important to it was to disappear. County Donegal is very fortunate to have two women, one in each of its constituencies, of such vigour with such tremendous interest in the fishing industry. Deputy Coughlan referred to the Donegal marine plan and stated that the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Environment and Local Government should establish a joint committee to consider the issues of transport, access, water and sewerage. I appreciate her suggestion and I will proceed further with it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to support for Killybegs and stated that she looks forward to my arrival with a cheque. The problem is that a succession of cheques have been sent to Killybegs and until one matter is concluded we cannot deal with the next. No one believes the next cheque is coming until they see it arrive. The development of Killybegs, which is crucial to County Donegal, will proceed. The Government is prepared to support the developments put forward by my Department, on which progress will be made as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan also stated that not enough funding had been provided for the fish processing industry and referred to the need to promote the pelagic sector. BIM has appointed a pelagic market co-ordinator who will work with exporters to develop markets for herring and mackerel. However, the co-ordinator has only just taken up his new position and he must be given the opportunity to settle in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to £1 million will be provided for remedial works on the existing piers at Killybegs this year and next year. The site investigations and technical study relating to the new pier development will be completed shortly and we cannot proceed to the next stage until they are received. The new <Col N="54" /> development is a major capital project which will take a number of years to complete. However, we are fully committed to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent raised a number of issues and stated that fishermen are not aware of the debate. The organisations that represent them are aware of the debate and I suggest that these organisations should do more to communicate with their members in respect of it. However, I appreciate the Deputy's point. It is not easy to get our message across to fishermen, particularly as they spend so much time at sea. BIM should be aware of that. We organised seminars across the country on the whitefish fleet renewal scheme. They were organised at times to accommodate the people concerned. They were well attended and produced good results.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sargent mentioned the issue of razor clams. We stopped issuing licenses for them some weeks ago. It was important that was done and I agreed with it, but it was not a simple matter. We had to get various officers from the Marine Institute together to work out the plans and to decide how the matter should be handled. The conservation and management regulations are being finalised for it and are nearly ready. If regulations are put in place, they must relate to conservation and to what will happen in the future. In this case there was a new fishery and there was not enough information. In the meantime I stopped the issue of licenses until this area is under control. The Deputy need have no fear about that side of the matter.</P>
      <P>He asked about the upper limit on licenses. It is whatever the limit was a few weeks ago and more licenses will not be issued until this area is assessed. The Wild Shellfish Committee of the IFO includes razor clam fishermen who want conservation. We will also meet them shortly.  </P>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy said about small harbours. I got £3 million this year for small harbours. This is the first time all allocation in that regard was included in our heads of Estimates. While that would be particularly beneficial to the aquaculture industry, I could not allocate all that money to it. While some of the people involved in that industry would not like to hear me say it, work must be carried out on some of the other small harbours. We tried to strike a proper balance. We will be able to carry out works on a certain number where the aquaculture industry is based. I hope more money will be available separately for that industry as I accept it merits it. We also want to carry out works to smaller harbours that facilitate a mix of activities that are crucial to the local areas concerned. We have started and such investment will prove to be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> We are living in a different era in terms of leisure and fisheries activities from that which pertained in the past. If we invest in this area now, other things will happen. However, one could have invested in these areas ten years ago and it would not have generated such development. There has been a good response from Deputies around the country to the use of that money. That is important because it means that people are beginning to realise such investment is important for the local communities concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a policy is devolve responsibility for this area to local authorities, but there is a problem in doing that. The Department will give them any advice they need. In allocating the £3 million secured, we asked the local authorities about the small harbours for which they had plans. We also considered our plans in relation to the acquaculture industry and we noted the view of the fishing sector.</P>

      <P>We do, but we want to strike a balance between the two areas. We do not want the money invested in only one area such as acquaculture, otherwise leisure activities, such as the classic ones in Skerries in the Deputy's constituency, would not benefit from such investment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan raised the need for exploration trials in the tuna fishery. During our negotiations we got resources from the EU, which were hard won.  We got money for the EU funded scientific tuna project which started last summer and it will continue this year. Up to 30 vessels have applied to participate in it and BIM are assessing them and trying to co-ordinate the project. Funding of up to £1 million will be available again this year. In light of the ban on driftnets that will come into force in three years' time, the exploratory programme and its success are critical to future sustainability of the tuna fishery. I accept Deputy Sheehan's point about the urgency of this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy raised the issue of the tourism angling measure. We are well on course to spend slightly more than £17 million on that measure. Initially the measure was slow to take off because we did not have such a measure in place previously. People had to prepare plans in the early stages. This measure has progressed well this year. It did well last year, although it did not do so well the year before, but that was the start-up period. The measure covers from 1994-99. It took off slowly in the beginning, is progressing very well now and there have been excellent developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned sea angling and coarse and game angling which are funded under the tourism angling development measure. There will be a major bid separately for Structural Funds for that area in the next round of negotiations. The Central Fisheries Board Develop<Col N="56" /> ment Plan 1990-2002 also covers angling development strategies. I also secured money this year for an investment of £400,000 in sea angling vessels to ensure they are safe. The allocation of that money for those vessels is a recognition for the first time, of their function and the importance of ensuring they are safe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keaveney spoke about the Foyle Fisheries legislation and aquaculture. It has major potential. In the context of that development and the North-South developments, she would like a Foyle Fisheries office to be set up in Inishowen. She always pitches for that side of Donegal. She welcomed the small pier programme. She mentioned the Moville Pier and other piers in her area. She stressed the areas that still require further investment and was particularly pleased about the investment made in Carrickarory Pier. I visited that area and I realise that investment was urgently required. That pier is in a busy area and those involved in the aquaculture industry make use of it. There is a good deal of work to be done in that area. The Foyle Fisheries legislation has been subsumed into the North-South framework and work is continuing on that legislation with a view to having it in place before the end of the year, the deadline in the British-Irish Agreement Act. Wider political developments will ultimately dictate the pace in that area, but work on that is progressing and it will be very important.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies for their interest in what is happening in this area. This is an ambitious programme but, as Deputies said, it is a well targeted one. It is also an appropriate one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department completed a comprehensive review of the Irish Genealogical Project, IGP, earlier this year. The purpose of the review was to consider whether the IGP should continue. The central issue addressed by the review was whether the investment of additional public resources in the IGP was required or warranted. My Department's review considered, <i>inter alia</i>, the past performance of the IGP, the findings of the Value For Money report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the IGP and its future potential. The review concluded that the IGP still has the potential to produce significant economic, social, cultural and political benefits to Ireland. The key strategic issues, in respect of which action must be taken if the IGP is to be a success, were iden<Col N="57" /> tified by the review and recommendations made as to how these issues should be addressed. The review concluded that the priority should be to deal with those issues which would have an impact on the project as a whole and that accordingly there exists a compelling case for supporting and resourcing the central management of the IGP to enable it to address an agreed programme of work directed at tackling the critical areas.</P>
      <P>The board of Irish Genealogy Limited, as managers of the project, was given the opportunity to consider the report of my Department's review and to comment on its contents. Having considered the review and the response of the board of Irish Genealogy Limited I decided, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, to provide Irish Genealogy Limited with funding of £210,000 in the current year. This funding will be conditional on Irish Genealogy Limited preparing and agreeing a business plan with my Department covering the period 1999-2000. The business plan will have to address and prioritise a number of critical tasks identified in my Department's review. The implementation of this business plan will be closely monitored by my Department.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply, but we would need more time than is available here to deal with the matter. The Minister spoke about her Department's internal assessment, but what is the current status of that report and at what level was it conducted? Will the Minister publish the report? The Heritage Council commissioned a report which was finalised last December and given to the Minister. Will she publish that report also? Has it been analysed and have any decisions been made on it by the Department? What is the relationship between the Department's internal report and the final conclusions of the report of the Heritage Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my initial reply, the review of the IGP by my Department was a comprehensive one. It had to be because of the concerns that had been raised. In addition, we wanted to see what we could do for this project. To do so we had to find the strengths and weaknesses of the IGP. That is why a business plan will now be drawn up, in consultation with my Department, to cover the period 1999-2000, and to target in the best possible way the £210,000 that will be allocated by the Department.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the reports are very comprehensive and certain recommendations were made. It is now time for us to go ahead with those recommendations which have already been initiated. The next move will be to hear from the IGP about its business plan and once that is agreed we can get on with the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not aware the Deputy was interested in the reports being published. I do not believe they will shed any greater light on the matter than I have already done. It is of interest that questions have been raised, not necessarily in the report, <Col N="58" /> but by the general public as to whether a dedicated workforce should be put in place to deal with a number of issues regarding local databases. That was one of the weaknesses that was revealed by the report. It was not so much the fact that the databases existed, but that not all of them had been completed.</P>
    <P>The FÁS personnel who have been involved in collecting information at local level have been exemplary. Because of that there is no need to put in a workforce as some people have suggested. The work that has been done by people on these FÁS schemes has been particularly good. It is a question of seeing how best we can manage to get all the databases around the country drawn up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that Ireland has not had a tradition of professional expertise in genealogical practice, and given that the whole area is riven with internal tension, jealousies and a great deal of envy, it would be helpful if the Minister laid copies of the internal report of her Department and the final report of the Heritage Council in the Dáil Library, and published them.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister account for the work to date in respect of the proposal to transfer personnel to Roscommon? What is the status of activity at the general registry office? This year £210,000 is being allocated on condition, by the Minister for certain works, which is right and proper. However, the Minister has been working on this project for two years. There is an opportunity for her to make an outstanding contribution to genealogy, but she appears to be merely tinkering around the edges. When one considers that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints &ndash; the Mormons &ndash; provide free internet access to microfilmed genealogical records dating from the mid-1800s, it makes a mockery of what we are trying to do. The Minister should take this issue by the scruff of the neck and lead from a ministerial point of view. There are tremendous opportunities and potential. The Minister could set an example for many other countries to follow, but in the current international context we are very far behind.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister think £210,000 will achieve this year? Is it her intention to lay out a three-year comprehensive development plan that will see the genealogy project creating genealogical practices for users both at home and internationally to achieve economic advantage from tourism roots? Is that the Minister's intention and where does she stand on the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We all recognise the tremendous work that can be done in the area of genealogy, not least for the tourism industry in dealing with the personal interests of those concerned. The Deputy will be aware that the IGP came under the Department of the Taoiseach and only in recent times was it transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. After being transferred, we had <Col N="59" /> to find where the strengths and weaknesses were in order to see what we could do about funding to improve the operation for those who wished to use the service. As we discovered, the IGP is of significant interest not only to local people but also to tourists. Many economic, social, cultural and political benefits stem from this matter.</P>
      <P>The business plan will be drawn up between the board of Irish Genealogy Limited and my Department. At this stage it would not be fair to pre-empt any such decisions. The plan is being drawn up and will provide a clear focus on where we want to go, particularly with regard to this year's funding totalling £210,000 for the period 1999-2000. Much work remains to be done. We must combine the tremendous work that has already been done at local level with the national overview to co-ordinate our efforts. When the IGP's functions were transferred to my Department, we had to examine what the situation was in terms of strengths and weaknesses, and work from there. That is exactly what we are doing. I agree with the Deputy that there is a wealth of knowledge to be correlated, and that is being done at local level. There is still a good deal of work to be done, but it is a question of planning in a co-ordinated way. That can best be done in the approach we have initiated between the ITP and my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not have responsibility for terminology in the Irish language nor for the provision of dictionaries relating to that language. Responsibility for the development of terminology lies with the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>One of the functions of An Foras Teanga or The Language Body, the North-South implementation body to be established under the Good Friday Agreement, is the development of terminology and dictionaries in the Irish language. This work will be effected on the establishment of that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that little or nothing is happening in the organic growth of terminology in the Irish language, even in the Gaeltacht areas? For a language to be real and alive it must grow organically. When one hears that there are 20,000 new words per year <Col N="60" /> coming into English it gives a measure of where we are. What Department is responsible for the development of terminology? What role will the Minister of State have according to the new Foras Teanga and will his Department have new responsibilities as a result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>De réir mar a thuigim, tá Coiste Téarmaíochta ann i láthair na huaire. There is a Coiste Téarmaíochta which works on this but it is not the responsibility of this Department.</P>
      <P>Traditionally Irish has had many more words in it than English, which is an advantage. There has been a great deal of development in the use of Irish terminology. Creating terminology has not been a difficulty; until now dissemination of that terminology was the problem. We know of the difficulties that arose in the Gaeltacht as a result of a lack of meáin chumarsáide. From the 1930s to the 1950s words like nurse and bicycle were common in the Gaeltacht as these terms were introduced through English. Raidio na Gaeltachta and TnaG have given great service in accepting new terminology and making people aware of it. For example, &ldquo;idirlíon&rdquo; is now accepted for the Internet.</P>
      <P>I often wonder if there is a necessity in English for some of the terminology that has been created. Much Eurospeak is beyond my comprehension until it is explained to me in ordinary English. I am not a big jargon man; much of the jargon we have is unnecessary, and I hope we do not introduce jargon into Irish as it would destroy it in the same way that Shakespeare's English has been destroyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Which Department is responsible for the Coiste Téarmaíochta? I do not propose to jargonise Irish, but given the age of information technology, does the Minister of State accept that there is a need to expand Irish terminology so that Irish can cater as effectively as English with the involved nature of that terminology? My difficulty is that there has been a trough period in Irish words evolving through usage, and Irish has not moved forward in this regard. The Minister of State did not say when the Foras Teanga will be put in place, but when it is will it be responsible to his Department? How will it be linked to Government Departments or State agencies? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an oversight on my part not to be more precise. If one looks at the Act passed recently dealing with the Agreement, which has not been implemented because of other difficulties, the Foras Teanga would be responsible to the Ministers. Those Ministers would be the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Minister for Education and Science and the appropriate Ministers in the North who would be dealing with language and related issues. One is not talking about a specific Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> Within the Act there is a power to give any direction, general or specific, from the Ministers together, North and South. The Coiste Téarmaíochta is at present under the Department of Education and Science and is not the responsibility of my Department.</P>
    <P>Irish has been bedeviled recently by the effort to find direct translation of words in English. We get translations that are in no way dúchasach and there may already be a way to say these things in Irish. Translation and finding matching terms in Irish is a very highly skilled occupation, and we should avoid direct translation. Words such as &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; and sites on it need Irish names, but we have found that it has not been hard to find words in the Irish idiom that give a graphic description of the term that is sometimes better than the English. Take &ldquo;software&rdquo;, which is &ldquo;bogearraí&rdquo; in Irish. That is not a problem because &ldquo;bog&rdquo; and &ldquo;earraí&rdquo; are old Irish words. There is a need to develop terminology, and that will become a very important function of the North-South Irish language body. We will have to have a focus for the dúchas, and then, having created terms, we must disseminate them, which has been a problem. The word &ldquo;rothar&rdquo; existed from the time the first bicycle was invented, but &ldquo;bicycle&rdquo; was commonly used in the Gaeltacht by people who had very little English because there was no way to disseminate &ldquo;rothar&rdquo; as there were no meáin cumarsáide. The big change for those who use Irish every day has been the meáin chumarsáide láidir béalGhaeilge in Raidio na Gaeltachta. That station has introduced new words into common usage as they are introduced in English by using them in news and official reports every day.</P>
    <P>Cohesion is a big European word for all sorts of things that have nothing to do with cohesion. How did we get familiar with this buzz word? We got it through the meáin cumarsáide, and we need vibrant meáin cumarsáide in Irish to make sure that new terminology is disseminated widely. We are moving in that direction, but I hope we do so in a way that does not lose the rich dúchas of the language.</P>
    <P>There are people who think that Irish has some difficulty with the modern world, though I do not include Deputies Kenny and O'Shea among them. I often hear native speakers in my constituency describe things in Irish that are indescribable in English. There is no particular lack in Irish as a language. Going back to what I said earlier about Douglas Hyde and knowledge of Irish words, I do not think we have a problem creating words or terminology. However, we have, historically, had a problem with dissemination. I hope the money we are spending on the meáin chumarsáide will deal with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In sharing the Minister's view that we should, as far as possible, retain the dúchas, the case he is making seems to be for updated dictionaries. When new terms come into common use in the English language, we would then be <Col N="62" /> able, using the dúchas terminology, to cover new definitions. There should be a definitive dictionary to which people can refer. From time to time, I look up technical terms in the dictionary and I am of the view that they do not come from the dúchas but from Gaeilge Bhaile Átha Cliath. Can we expect to see a comprehensive, modern dictionary in the Irish language in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>That is part of our remit. A great deal of work has been carried out on dictionaries but even the Oxford dictionary requires constant updating. There are a number of issues here, one of which relates to terminology. Relying on dictionaries <i>per se</i> could give rise to problems. When the word &lsquo;rochtain' &ndash; meaning access &ndash; started to appear in documents, I was not sure what it meant. Any native Irish speaker would say &lsquo;an bealach isteach go dtí' or &lsquo;fáil isteach go háit' and that would be perfectly correct. If one were to use the word &lsquo;rochtain' to a native Irish speaker in Connemara they would ask &lsquo;céard faoi atá tú ag caint?'. One would answer &lsquo;tá mé ag iarraidh go mbeadh fáil isteach do chuile dhuine go dtí áit éigin'. We must be wary of the one/one match.</P>
      <P>When we create official names for things using ordinary words in conjunction with each other, we should at the same time create an equivalent Irish version. We have a responsibility to do that. When we use terms such as Agenda 2000, we should immediately create an Irish equivalent which would be accepted as the standard Irish version of the English term. We must create that type of bilingualism. I regret that there seems to be less inclination now to give Irish names to agencies and bodies than there was in the past when everyone referred to Bord na Móna as Bord na Móna and to Bus Éireann as Bus Éireann. We could make our lives a good deal easier by ensuring official bodies or programmes within Government or the public service have official Irish titles.</P>

The comhdháil encourages these communities to become involved in local development as well as provid<Col N="63" /> ing a forum of communication between island communities. The comhdháil regularly makes representations to my Department with regard to the many problems facing islanders and assistance has been provided to the comhdháil by my Department at various times.</P>
      <P>I attended the annual general meeting of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann on 17 April 1999 in Oranmore, County Galway; my Department regards the comhdháil as the official voice of islanders and the concerns expressed by it are dealt with in that light.

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Gaeltacht islanders will have a voice in the Údarás na Gaeltachta elections. Because so many deficiencies on the islands relate to infrastructure, close links have been developed between the Department and the islanders over the past year. The AGM revealed the depth of communication and inter-working which have been developed with islanders up and down the coast. A very intensive two hour question and answer session followed my half hour address to the meeting. I received the impression that islanders feel things are happening now, that current structures are delivering to them and that the strength of those structures lies in their simplicity.</P>
      <P>There is now a direct connection between islanders and the Department and the Department is carrying our major work in co-ordinating the work of bodies such as Údarás, other Departments and semi-State bodies to ensure the delivery of services to islanders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht islands are moving in the right direction. The efforts made over the past number of years by this and previous Governments support that. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has taken over responsibility for the Water Scheme Federation and has given its chief executive &ndash; for want of a better word &ndash; a salary which is pitched at departmental level. Apparently, that federation has the right and authority to alter lists recommended by local authorities in regard to water schemes. Is it the Minister's intention to increase the authority and responsibility of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann by allowing it a direct input and decision-making influence on proposals for island development by Departments and local authorities? Is the comhdháil to have a formalised responsibility through which it can influence events?</P>

      <P>I have no great knowledge of the other case referred to by Deputy Kenny. I take the view that, at the end of the day, the buck stops with me and my senior colleague in regard to any decisions made. I cannot allow a situation to develop where the comhdháil could overrule any decisions I might make. Since most of the direct spend on the islands is incurred directly by my Department, the power to make final decisions will rest with the Minister. I do not envisage a situation arising whereby the comhdháil could overrule a decision taken by the Minister.</P>

      <P>If a future Minister has a list of developments in regard to slipways, piers or whatever he or she wants prioritised for Gaeltacht or non-Gaeltacht islands, Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann might decide on a different order of priority. I fully understand that no organisation subservient to a Minister should be able to overrule him, but can the Minister of State envisage such an organisation having a direct influence on the priority listing of development projects on the islands? A Minister might have a personal preference to undertake one project before another. In such a situation could Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann have a say in drawing up priority lists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a foolish Minister who would ignore the views of the islanders he was appointed to serve. However, in the event of a Minister believing one thing should be done and a body such as Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann believing something else should be done, the Minister's view would have to prevail. As long as I am Minister of State, that is how it will be. I have been elected by the people and appointed by the Taoiseach as Minister of State with responsibility for the islands to make such decisions. Those of us who are in Government must consider many aspects of every question. There is a danger in giving the power of direction to a particular group. I am sure Deputy Kenny, when in Government, had people pull him by the sleeve to tell him quietly that bodies which were supposed to represent their interest did not do so. In such cases one must make valued judgments.</P>
      <P>I do not foresee conflict between myself and Comhdháil Oileán na hÉireann. To date, we have had the most harmonious relationship. I will continue to listen carefully to what they ask for, promote or suggest. In a situation such as that described by Deputy Kenny, where my priority was in conflict with theirs, the decision would be made by the Government. I will face any electorate on that fundamental issue. To do otherwise would be to undermine those who elected me and on whose authority I make decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">

      <P>As I have explained in replies to previous parliamentary questions, the Government has approved a proposal submitted to it by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to the restructuring of the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta. The Bill which will be published soon will provide for the giving of legislative effect to this restructuring and to other proposals in relation to Údarás na Gaeltachta. The Bill will specifically provide for an increase in the number of constituencies for the purposes of elections to Údarás na Gaeltachta and for an increase in the number of elected members to an tÚdarás. I am satisfied the proposals in this regard will meet the demands of Gaeltacht communities for increased representation on the board of an tÚdarás and that this increased elected representation will contribute to addressing the needs of Gaeltacht communities in general and as a result to maintaining and promoting the Irish language in the Gaeltacht. These proposals will involve the most significant legislative changes in relation to an tÚdarás since it was established nearly 20 years ago and I look forward to a fruitful debate on the proposals when they come before the House.</P>
      <P>While it had been hoped that this Bill would have been available sooner, the drafting process has not yet been finally completed. In the light of this the Government has agreed that a short Bill extending the maximum interval between the elections to Údarás na Gaeltachta from five years to five years and six months will be published. This proposal was to have been included at any rate in the comprehensive Bill being drafted. The short Bill will be introduced in Dáil Éireann in the very near future. The purpose of this short Bill is to enable the next election to an t-Údarás, which has been due to take place in early June, to be held later this year in accordance with the revised structures which I have already outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate when the comprehensive Bill will be published? Will he give details of the numbers to be elected to Údarás na Gaeltachta and of the new constituencies? In view of the fact that the board of an tÚdarás is a semi-industrial board concerned with the provision of postanna sna Gaeltachtaí, would it not be more feasible to hold elections every four and a half years? If Údarás elections continue to be held after local and European Parliament elections, they will be treated as a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The short Bill will provide for the holding of elections at any time between four years and five and a half years after the previous election, as opposed to four years and five years. If we had intended holding this year's elections on 11 June, as I think the Deputy proposes, a Bill such as this would have been required because <Col N="66" /> that will be five years and two days from the date of the last Údarás elections. This minor amendment will allow a Minister, in the future, to realign the Údarás elections with the European and local elections without encountering the problem which would have arisen this year. If we had retained the old formula for Údarás elections we would have faced problems if European elections were held even a few days more than five years apart. This amendment is therefore desirable for that reason as well as in its own right.</P>
      <P>The short Bill must be before the Oireachtas in the next few weeks because the date for setting the election, under the regulation, is mid-May. I can also assure the Deputy that the larger, more comprehensive change to the Údarás will take place in this Dáil session. Because we are extending the life of the board by only six months, the elections must be held in the autumn and we must introduce the amending legislation before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>While many people in the Gaeltacht feel that Údarás elections should be held on the same day as European and local elections, a large body of opinion takes the contrary view that the Údarás elections should be held on a separate day. It is felt that if they were held on the same day as local and European elections and a referendum, the Gaeltacht debate would be swamped by other issues. Much more Irish language and general media attention will be directed to the Gaeltacht issue if the Údarás elections are held on a separate day. This may not be a bad thing.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is aware that the MSF trade union is seeking representation on the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta. Does he intend to grant that request? Will the Minister of State confirm that Ring Gaeltacht will have a place on the reconstituted Údarás? Before the elections take place, does the Minister of State intend to alter the boundaries of Gaeltacht areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every Deputy who represents a Gaeltacht community, I have a received a letter from MSF which represents workers in Údarás na Gaeltachta. I was a little surprised that it was in English. This was disconcerting. I am certain, however, that this was an oversight. There is no proposal to provide statutory representation for MSF on the board of Údarás. On one occasion a trade unionist was selected as a ministerial nominee while a member of staff was selected on two occasions. This was at the discretion of the Minister concerned; it did not occur under the Worker Participation Act.</P>
      <P>In moving towards a mainly elected board, it is not intended to have a member of staff on the board. The staff of Údarás are mainly administrative and managerial. They are represented mainly by MSF whose members, some at senior level, are central to all the major management decisions. I will forward a copy of the press release outlining the Government's decision to the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> There is a need to improve dramatically the representation of the smaller Gaeltachts. Deputy Kenny will be delighted to learn that the number elected in County Mayo is to be doubled to two. Small Gaeltachts, such as Ring, Ráth Cairn and Baile Ghiobain, will be guaranteed representation on the board for the first time. This is an important step in the right direction. These Gaeltachts, though small, are vibrant.</P>
    <P>The Údarás Act has always defined its area of operation as the Gaeltachts as defined in the 1956 Act under which an order would have to be made to change the boundaries. I do not see this happening before the next Údarás election. I have asked the CSO to conduct detailed analyses of linguistic patterns throughout the country to allow work on the broader issue of Gaeltacht boundaries to proceed. I hope the legislation to be introduced shortly will have as long a shelf life as the Act which has lasted 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the minor amending legislation will be introduced before the summer recess and that the major legislation will be dealt with in the autumn session? Competition in any area of life produces more tangible results. Those in the Gaeltacht who believe Gaeltacht elections should be held on a separate day do their cause an injustice. The Irish language media should be able to highlight the relevance of Údarás elections in Gaeltacht areas. We could save ourselves a great deal of trouble by stipulating that local, Údarás and European Parliament elections should take place on the same day. With the devolution of power to the regions, the electorate will have an opportunity to vote on an increasing range of appointees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State look again at the question of statutory representation for MSF? He said that the staff of Údarás are primarily administrative. They should not be debarred because of this. The principle of worker participation is important and will contribute to a more effective and committed approach on the part of all involved. Does the Minister of State have any mechanism in mind whereby it will be possible to deal in a more systematic and effective manner with Gaeltacht boundaries? There are problems which have not been addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The minor legislation has to be passed by mid-May; otherwise, legal difficulties will be encountered in making the regulations for the election which, under the Act, has to be held before 9 June. Deputies will have an opportunity to debate these issues again at that stage. The major legislation will also be passed before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of having the election on a separate day &ndash; because there are hot issues in west Mayo and west Galway &ndash; media time in the run-up to the local elections in June will be at a premium. For that reason on this occasion I <Col N="68" /> would welcome a heightened national debate. Some people cavil about the cost but it will be small. This is a sorry state of affairs because we could afford democracy when the country was much poorer. It would not be a waste of money to have the election on a separate day. We should have a major debate about the future of the Gaeltachts and the Irish language. If the wider media can be brought into the debate, all the better. That would be a healthy development. I will reflect on what Deputy O'Shea had to say about representation on the board of Údarás in respect of which the Government has made a decision.</P>
    <P>On Gaeltacht boundaries, a considerable amount of work has been done. I am awaiting information from the CSO which has been most helpful in making available its data which, compared to our scéimeanna na Gaeilge, is proving intriguingly accurate in relation to daily speakers of Irish, etc. It is giving us very accurate pictures which match up to people's experience and that of our field officers.</P>
    <P>I am actively involved in trying to develop programmes to deal with the pressures on the Irish language in the Gaeltacht. I am also looking at setting objective linguistic criteria by which we could measure whether areas should be in the Gaeltacht. That was not something which was considered when they were originally drawn. We had a different approach to matters in those days.</P>
    <P>These issues are ongoing in the Department and much work is being done. I will announce a number of schemes, which are part of a large canvas on which we are working. We are putting it together piece by piece. I do not want to hold back things which can be done immediately because I cannot put the whole picture in place. Deputies will see a comprehensive picture evolve in the coming months. This issue has to be tackled and there are issues as regards Gaeltacht boundaries on which we will have to bite the bullet. We must be fair and equitable and give the various communities a chance to see on what criteria we are making these decisions. We could not do that within a timescale of two or three months nor would it be right to put back the Údarás na Gaeltachta election for two or three years.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>EU Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992, the Habitats Directive, requires member states to propose, on the basis of specified scientific criteria, relevant natural areas containing specified wildlife habitats and species for designation as special areas of conservation, SACs, and to protect their favourable conservation status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> The directive also required member states to transmit to the EU Commission a list of the proposed areas, together with full information on each site, within three years of the date of the notification of the directive.</P>
    <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law in February 1997 by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94/97). Some 207 areas proposed for inclusion in Ireland's SAC network have, since March 1997, been publicly advertised for SAC designation and receive legal protection in Ireland from that date.</P>
    <P>Ireland is currently in breach of the directive in respect of the requirement to transmit the list to Brussels, within the timeframe set out in the directive. However, my Department is ensuring effective conservation of more than 500,000 hectares of land included in the 207 publicly advertised sites and the non-transmission of the list has no damaging conservation impact on these sites.</P>
    <P>In August 1998, I transmitted to the EU Commission an initial list of 39 sites where no objections to their designation were received by my Department. In January last, I met officials of DG XI of the EU Commission and outlined a programme for formally transmitting notice of additional sites to them. My Department to date listed a total of 103 sites to the Commission and it is anticipated that notice of 95 per cent of the sites published will be transmitted by the end of July next. The Deputy will appreciate that there must be adequate public consultation before a list of sites are formally transmitted to the EU Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean 104 sites have not yet been transmitted to Brussels as part of the Minister's list? Are there any proposals to increase the 207 SACs originally advertised? What is the status in terms of having those sites approved locally and notice of them transmitted to Brussels? Is 207 the final figure in respect of SACs receiving legal protection here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is well aware that there was some concern, particularly among local communities, where SACs were designated. Many local people felt they did not have an opportunity to have an input into their designation. The Minister of State and I were particularly concerned that there should be a local input and we ensured that under the appeals system, there would be liaison committees to allow people the opportunity to raise issues of scientific interest and concern in the designation of the SACs.</P>
      <P>It is as a result of this consultation process &ndash; one which was very much needed &ndash; that there may seem to be delays. I underline that 207 sites have been publicly advertised. People are aware of those sites and they are protected in law from the first day of their designation. There is no question of damage to conservation on those sites. They have legal protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> The Minister of State and I went to Brussels to talk to people in DG XI and to explain the difficulties. We have, at all times, said it is important to get co-operation among local communities if we are to have sustained conservation. In rural areas and areas involved in farming, in particular, people have always been to the fore in conservation. We want to ensure a consultation process so that everyone may have a part in the final decisions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked whether there will be further sites. We plan on 207 sites at the moment. As I said to DG XI, we have a plan of action to ensure any site about which there has not been controversy or about which people do not wish to appeal a decision have been immediately listed with Brussels. As these sites are cleared through the appeals board, Brussels will be notified of the decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I love the utopian assertion by the Minister that every protection is in place and there is no problem. I am sure many NGOs would disagree, as I would. Is the Minister aware that the Irish Peatland Conservation Council specified the need for 113 additional raised bogs to be included in the SAC designation list and 19 additional blanket bogs? Is the Minister aware Scotland has a much higher percentage of its original peat land listed as SACs than Ireland?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the assertion by the IPCC that ten mountain ranges were not surveyed for SAC designation? It has given me a list which I will give to the Minister if she would like it. Will she say whether the review of the SACs and the additional list will be submitted and if Ireland will be compliant by September of this year when the Atlantic biogeographical seminar is held in this country? That seminar will focus on progress to date as regards countries' compliance with the habitat directive.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister include Rogerstown Estuary in her review? It is divided by a railway line that is not relevant to wildlife which, by all accounts, regard it as a single estuary? Will she look at that again to ensure it is considered as a single habitat rather than one divided by a railway line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in consultation with the IPCC and both I and the Minister of State have had the opportunity to meet the IPCC and discuss issues pertaining to it. I found it extremely co-operative in that it has always been very forthcoming in what it wishes us to achieve in Government. We also realise the importance of raised and blanket bogs.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that Ireland has perhaps some of the best examples of such bogs, some of which are still, thankfully, in pristine condition. We are and wish to be compliant with the relevant directive to ensure these examples are preserved for future generations. We feel we have achieved a fair balance between preservation of bogs and the rights of local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I will certainly take on board the suggestion of the Deputy regarding the ten mountain ranges which he feels are not on a list or should be reviewed and his suggestion concerning the estuary. I will examine these issues if the Deputy furnishes me with further information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>In her reply the Minister stated every protection is in place, something with which I agree, particularly in relation to bogs. Given this and the Department's monitoring and protecting the sites, why will the Minister not allow the continuation of turf cutting in the west Roscommon area? What percentage of the proposed sites are owned either by the State or Bord na Móna? Are there other bogs which could be designated which are in the ownership of the State or Bord na Móna? Of the 95 per cent of sites to be transmitted to Brussels in July, how many are bogs? How many of these bogs are controversial? Have all the esker sites been submitted to Brussels? When will the Minister deal with compensation for farmers where eskers have been zoned for designation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy has tabled a specific question concerning bogs in the west and the traditional rights associated with them. This question concerns SACs in general. Very many habitats are involved in the overall definition of SAC, and not just raised bogs, although I agree with the Deputy that raised bogs are a very important component. I do not have information concerning percentages, but if the Deputy wishes I will send that information to him.</P>

      <P>Clonegan Church, Portlaw, County Waterford, is a monument which is included in the record of monuments and places established under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994. As the monument is in private ownership I have no proposals to refurbish it but Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, will provide advice to any person proposing to carry out work on the church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> The Deputy will be aware that the Heritage Council is a statutory autonomous body established under the Heritage Act, 1995. Under the Act, the council has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the built heritage. I wish to point out, however, that while I provide operational funding to the Heritage Council under my Department's Vote, I have no function in relation to the council's decisions on the disbursement of funds.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that last year I and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced a package of measures for the protection of the architectural heritage. Among these measures is the establishment of a new grant aid scheme for approved conservation works to listed buildings which will commence very soon. The new grants scheme will be administered by the local authorities. It will have funding of £4 million per annum and will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards drawn up by an advisory group made up of the two Departments and the Heritage Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that Clonegan Church is very important from an architectural and historical perspective? Indeed, much of the history of the current family of the Marquis of Waterford is connected with the church. Is the Minister or any agency under her Department willing to enter into discussions with the Church of Ireland authorities concerning the church? I believe the Church of Ireland would be willing to put into State ownership Clonegan Church and some other churches in the south-east region on the basis that they would be preserved. They are a very important part of our heritage. The Minister will be aware that a window was blown out in Clonegan Church. Efforts are being made to find a contractor to repair it. If the church is not attended to within a reasonable time span, a vital part of the heritage of County Waterford will be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that Clonegan Church is of great historical interest. However, I must point out that it is not in State ownership. I already have responsibility for maintaining and managing 750 of the most prestigious national monuments and historical properties in the State. The Deputy is aware that a different issue is raised by Clonegan Church and other properties in private ownership. I advise those interested in Clonegan Church, including the Deputy, to contact the Heritage Council, a statutory autonomous body established to examine such buildings. In terms of advice, including technical advice, the Deputy is also welcome to contact Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and we will see what we can do in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> Another possibility arises in the context of the architectural legislation which will be passing through the House either next week or the following week. Once implemented, projects such as this may well be in receipt of money, depending on acceptance of the application. I will not be dealing with these applications as the grant system we are putting in place will be run by local authorities. However, I advise the Deputy to look at the issue in the context of this forthcoming legislation as a good alternative.</P>

      <P>The core policy goal of my Department in relation to the Irish language is to reverse the decline in the use of the language as the principal means of communication in the Gaeltacht and to extend its use in the rest of the country. A supporting objective to that policy goal is to encourage the expansion of the use of Irish and the delivery of State services through Irish on a countrywide basis.</P>
      <P>While no specific decision has been taken by this or previous Governments that the policy objective of the State is that Ireland should be a bilingual society, the thrust of policy in recent years has been to encourage the expansion of bilingualism throughout the country. In the Gaeltacht, of course, the policy remains that Irish should be the principal means of communication.</P>

    <P>The North-South language body dealing with the Irish language opens up new and exciting possibilities on an all-Ireland basis to promote bilingualism and, indeed, this development was <Col N="74" /> widely welcomed when the Bill was before the Oireachtas. It is difficult to measure the extent of the progress made in the past ten years towards achieving a bilingual society as there are no relevant statistics available. There has undoubtedly been some progress judging from the number of pupils who have passed through the education system, the growth in the number of Gaelscoileanna and those attending Irish classes and courses in the Gaeltacht and the activities of the voluntary Irish language organisations.</P>
    <P>Regarding my views on the level of success achieved since the foundation of the State in the restoration of the Irish language, it is a little facile of the Deputy to expect me to cover this matter adequately in reply to a parliamentary question which must of necessity be brief. There has been considerable progress, as evidenced in the census returns. In the period 1926 to 1991, the number of people returned in the census of population as being able to speak Irish increased from 540,820 or 19.3 per cent of the population aged three years and over to 1,095,830 or 32.5 per cent of the population. Between 1986 and 1991, the number of Irish speakers increased by 53,129 or 5.1 per cent, while there was a decline of 39,755 or 1.4 per cent in the number of non-Irish speakers. A new question on ability to speak the Irish language and frequency of speaking Irish was introduced in the 1996 census. The returns showed that 1,430,205 people aged three and over or 39.5 per cent of the population claimed to be Irish speakers. This progress is in no small part due to State policy in promoting the language through the education system and on a broad front through State assistance generally, combined with the efforts of the Irish language organisations.</P>
    <P>The language Bill will set out for the first time a comprehensive legal framework for the position of Irish and will, I hope, create a more level playing pitch for the two official languages.</P>

      <P>I want to be accurate in my interpretation of what the Minister of State said. I understand the achievement of a bilingual society is not a policy objective of the Government. Despite the fact that he has already stated there is an uncanny resemblance between the census returns and the experience of offices of his Department regarding use of the Irish language, does he agree the information the census provided is subjective and, therefore, of doubtful value in terms of assessing the level of spoken Irish, either in the Gaeltacht or in the Galltacht? Does he agree there is a consensus within the education sector that the standard of Irish at leaving certificate level, for example, has been deteriorating? We can bandy about statistics but the language is in decline. Does he agree that, unless we have an open and honest national debate in which the language is not treated as a sacred cow but as one of our national treasures with the <Col N="75" /> potential to enrich our lives, we will not reverse a trend which causes concern to those involved in the revival of the language?</P>

      <P>I have always been a little sceptical about the number of Irish speakers compiled by the census, although they are the only comparative figures I have. I do not have the figures for the number of people who speak Irish daily because the question was not asked. Therefore, the only comparative figures we have are for the number of people who have some Irish.</P>
      <P>There is some validity to the figure of 39.5 per cent. I always start and end the speeches I make in Irish as I travel around the country. The majority of people seem to understand what I say because they laugh at the appropriate moment. A large number of people have a comprehension of Irish.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a large number of people who understand Irish which would not have been the case 100 years ago. More people would have spoken Irish every day then and a number would have had no English, but there would also have been many who did not know any Irish. That n has changed in the past 100 years because of education policies.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned about what I perceive as the decline in the standard of Irish in schools. I am puzzled by this because the Department of Education and Science has allocated many resources to it. It is valid to ask why people who spend 13 years learning Irish do not know it when they finish school. I launched a package yesterday for the idirbhliain based on <i>Ros na Rún.</i> With all the facilities available, learning the language should be easier. It is attractive if one can watch nice programmes on television as a way of learning a language. We should compare this with the way we had to learn it in the classroom years ago.</P>
      <P>More interesting information is available from the last census, but I do not have comparative figures. I have examined the figures closely and, allowing for the bulge in figures because of schoolchildren who say they speak Irish every day because they speak it in class, it appears about 104,000 people speak the language every day. I wish to correct the figure of 70,000 which has been bandied about. That relates to people over 19, but those between three and 19 who also speak Irish every day at home and not just in school must also be included. They are legitimate Irish speakers. It is fair to say there would not have been 100,000 people who used Irish every day 30 to 40 years ago. On the basis of documentation available at the time, that would not appear to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> If one studies the speech patterns of older people on the margins of the Gaeltachtaí and how little Irish they know, the meath na Gaeltachta has not been that considerable considering the huge pressures on the language. Times have changed and those huge pressures on the language and the Gaeltachtaí are of major concern. In that context, there is a need for radical steps to see how the Gaeltachtaí, which are tobar na Gaeilge, can be retained as Irish language communities. I have no doubt the language will survive, but Irish language communities are a different issue. I am concentrating on them at present. Huge forces are affecting them, one of which is economic success which, while a good thing, poses a challenge.</P>
    <P>I have no fear for the Irish language, taking into account the number of speakers in the country who speak it on a daily basis. The level of competency in Irish among the population at large, the balance of the 39.5 per cent, is perhaps questionable. However, there is no question about the survival of a dispersed Irish language community. When I was asked this question in Scotland I said that the Irish language is like the grass growing in tarmac; every time people think they have got rid of it, they find it sprouts again. I have no fear for the future of the Irish language into the new millennium.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a national debate. I am disappointed at society's unwillingness to recognise that it should have two official languages, Irish and English, living side by side. It is towards that end and to ensure final and full recognition by the major institutions, not only State institutions, and a complete change in mindset that I am introducing a language Bill. It will do what has been done in other countries with major and minor languages, for example, Canada, Wales, the Basque country etc. It will put the two languages on a much more equal footing in terms of official recognition.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for accepting this Adjournment matter. Kilmallock is probably the fourth largest town in County Limerick. It has a strong rural hinterland. Kilmallock and Newcastlewest were divested in December 1995 when an American company, Neodata, decided to close both operations. The Newcastlewest premises was sold to a private individual while a company established a teleservices centre in Kilmallock. This would be in conformity with the call by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment at her recent party conference in Galway to people in the private sector to take the initiative and set up business ventures. In this instance a group of people bought the teleservices centre, customised and altered it and turned it into a a modern building that any potential teleservices could move into at short notice, get a turn key facility and establish an operation.</P>
      <P>The people in the area who decided on this course of action deserve to be congratulated on their initiative. However, there has been disappointment since then. In July 1998 the Tánaiste visited the facility. I met her there with many other politicians and community leaders from the Kilmallock area. She commended the initiative shown by these people and, with the industrial agencies present, indicated that they would do their utmost to market the facility. To date there has been no movement of business to the area.</P>
      <P>In view of the competition for industry on the Kilmallock to Limerick road and in the surrounding area, incentives must be offered to industrialists to move to rural locations. There is a huge incentive in the case of Kilmallock where there is a turn key facility ideally equipped on the teleservices side, which has recently been a booming part of the economy. In many instances potential industrialists do not have a customised building to move into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste may have forgotten her visit to Kilmallock in July 1998, but Kilmallock has not forgotten her. Enterprise Ireland and SFADCc operate in the region and I ask them to try to get a potential industrialist for this community. The town has high levels of unemployment. Despite this it has a vibrancy, with the council spending almost £2 million in trying to revitalise the urban part. It is a town with a proud history, where two schools have amalgamated in recent times and there are now 800 pupils in a new educational establishment. The town also has a ready pool of labour with many people who are computer literate, articulate and good in customer relations and who have a proud tradition having worked with the previous company. The town now needs a <Col N="78" /> shove by the promotion agencies to get an industrialist into this premises.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, is deputising for the Tánaiste. There are probably similar communities in Wexford making a passionate plea for industrial development. In Kilmallock there is both a premises and a facility. All it needs is an employer to move into the location. I can assure whoever moves in that he will never regret his decision because he will get a very good workforce and premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I assure the Deputy I will pass on his case which he presented very strongly. The securing of alternative or new industry for any area of the country is a day-to-day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one in which the Minister has a direct function.</P>
      <P>Mayday Management Consultants, I hope the name is not an omen, were commissioned in 1998 to carry out an economic scoping study of Kilmallock for the Kilmallock Association of Trade and Commerce. This study was co-ordinated by Shannon Development and supported by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Limerick County Enterprise Board. The final report, which has now been completed, outlines how Kilmallock could develop into the future and identifies development weaknesses which require attention by all the agencies. IDA Ireland, for its part, continues to promote Kilmallock and its environs to mobile overseas investors.</P>
      <P>The availability of the Kilimallock Teleservices Centre now represents an important addition to the capital based industrial infrastructure in this area. In addition to the existing industrial property portfolio in the area, the centre gives Kilmallock an added value option in terms of supporting inward investment. SFADCo continues to work closely with the promoter of the centre to widen marketing efforts and revitalise certain contacts made in its early development. The agency has offered to fund the redesign of the centre brochure to allow for wider market appeal and it intends to work closely with the promoter and to position this area as a key priority for development within the east Limerick area.</P>
      <P>Apart from the efforts to attract inward investment to the region, I am informed by SFADCo that it is working to develop expansions to existing businesses and towards the development of certain new businesses. Limerick south-east had a total of 22 indigenous companies employing 429 people in December 1998 compared to 22 companies employing 394 in December 1997. Kilmallock accounts for over 60 per cent of this employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> I assure the Deputy that a determined drive is under way by the industrial development agencies to achieve a better regional distribution of industry. In this regard I am hopeful that the strenuous campaign being mounted by the various agencies will have positive results in the medium term. However, in the final analysis, the decision on where to locate operations rests with the potential clients themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this Adjournment matter. Castledermot has an antiquated sewerage system which is totally inadequate to meet the needs of the town. It is hindering development from a residential as well as a commercial point of view. The town is well positioned on the N9 and is ideal for both types of development. There have been numerous applications for residential developments that have had to be put on hold because of the present state of the sewerage system.</P>
      <P>The close proximity of the town to Carlow makes it an ideal location for commercial development. An IDA site in the town could be developed if proper sewerage facilities were made available. A hotel is also proposed for the town but this was put on hold because of the sewerage problems. Both local and national developers have expressed an interest in obtaining many of the fine sites available within the remit of the town, only to find that the sewerage system has been the cause of delays in planning applications. This town urgently needs a proper sewerage system. I ask the Department to allocate funding to Kildare County Council for this purpose. The result would ensure that this historic town can develop in tandem with all the other towns in south Kildare which are experiencing a boom in residential development. Available sites can be sold for development. There is a need in the south Kildare area for residential development. Many people travel to Dublin each day from their homes in south Kildare. If the sewerage system in Castledermot was upgraded, residential developments could be provided. It is crazy that the sewerage system in Castledermot is designed in a way which does not allow for any development in the town. As a result, Castledermot has fallen behind all the other towns. I would ask the Minister to ensure that money is made available to allow Castledermot to develop on an equal footing with the other towns in south Kildare.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wall knows of my interest and affinity for County Kildare. I will pass on his request to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who is unable to be in the House to <Col N="80" /> respond. He asked me to apologise and reply on his behalf.</P>
      <P>This matter has been raised with the Minister on numerous occasions over the past 22 months by Deputy Power and Senator Dardis. However, I thank Deputy Wall for raising it this evening.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I want to outline the broader picture in relation to investment in water and sewerage services before I deal with the specific matter raised by the Deputy. The extent of the Government's commitment to the water services area generally has again been firmly underlined by the unprecedented level of investment set out in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme, which was published in January last.</P>
      <P>The 1999 programme is by far the largest ever. At £275 million, investment in water and sewerage services this year will be 50 per cent greater than last year and no less than double the size of the 1996 spend. Funding of this order will impact substantially on the environmental infrastructure and the ability of that infrastructure to meet current and projected development needs from residential, industrial and other forms of economic activity.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that the Deputy's county is a significant beneficiary of the 1999 programme which includes Kildare schemes worth approximately £37 million. Listed to start construction are Monasterevin water and Prosperous sewerage schemes. The Kilcullen, Osberstown, and Leixlip sewerage schemes are included for continued construction.</P>
      <P>Funding has also been approved under the serviced land initiative for schemes worth almost £1.5 million at Calverstown, Derrinturn, Kilcock, Kildare/Rathangan, Kill and Prosperous, designed to bring additional serviced residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to ease pressures on the housing market. It is clear that Kildare is getting a fair share of available funding and that the schemes which have been approved will greatly contribute to removing development constraints and to creating the infrastructure needed to support and expand tourism and other important economic activities. I am conscious of the strong case for Castledermot made by Deputy Wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is aware of the sewerage needs of Castledermot. A revised preliminary report was submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government on 6 July 1998. This proposal comes within the terms of the Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by the Department in framing future water and sewerage services <Col N="81" /> investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>
    <P>In addition, the scheme will be considered, along with all other competing proposals, under the rural towns and villages initiative. This initiative, which was announced in the budget by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, a fellow Kildare man, aims to provide much needed water and sewerage facilities in small rural towns and villages.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, the ball is in Deputy Wall's court. It would be pleasant for any of us to have the Minister for Finance living in his or her territory. As he is a strong GAA man also, I am sure the Deputy will find a road to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue. The reaction of all who viewed the RTE programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; was one of deep shock and hurt that such brutal and sadistic cruelty was visited on the most vulnerable children under the supervision of the State's institutions. The State must acknowledge its role in the severe damage caused to many children. The State must apologise for what occurred. There must be a full inquiry into the facts surrounding the abuse which took place in the industrial schools. I ask the Minister for a firm commitment that such an inquiry takes place.</P>
      <P>Why should children who fell on hard times be battered, brutalised, dehumanised and made victims of sexual abuse? Their only crime was being poor. These people must have their stories heard and their suffering understood and they must receive a compassionate response from the State.</P>
      <P>We must make sure that what happened does not recur. We must ensure that this generation of legislators are not found culpable of failure to act. Child abuse continues. The level of abuse is increasing, yet there is a high level of legislative neglect. During the period from September to December in 1998 there were approximately 100 incidents reported to the Garda where suspicious approaches were made to children yet the Government will not introduce a child sex offenders' register.</P>
      <P>We urgently need a children's ombudsman's office established on a statutory basis to promote and protect children's rights. Children have the right to feel safe, not to be brutalised and dehumanised. Children have a right not to suffer from sexual abuse. Children have a right to be treated with the same respect for their person and dignity as every human being. A children's ombudsman will ensure that this is adhered to as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that all those who signed shall undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the <Col N="82" /> rights. Accordingly, as Ireland ratified the convention the Government is obliged to take steps to ensure compliance with the provision to protect and promote children's rights. A children's ombudsman is a priority.</P>
    <P>There are a significant number of children in situations of considerable disadvantage. These include children in care, children in legal custody, children who are subject to abuse and neglect, homeless children and children with disabilities. The Government should introduce a children's ombudsman as an overall mechanism for the promotion of the rights of children generally.</P>
    <P>We cannot undo the past. We must recognise and apologise for what happened. While many of the religious orders who ran industrial schools have apologised to those children they damaged and hurt, there has been silence from the State.</P>
    <P>In referring to the involvement of the religious, for full clarification I wish to quote my esteemed friend, Senator Norris, who stated yesterday in the Seanad:</P>
    <P>One would think this matter concerns only the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of Mercy. I went to an upmarket Protestant boarding school in this State and nothing I have seen or heard on television is strange to me. I am aware of lives ruined in these institutions by depraved and sadistic masters bullying, beating and handing out corporal punishments. I know of people who are still damaged. Let us not think it was only the Roman Catholic working class which was mistreated by orders of nuns and priests. It was an entire ethos.</P>
    <P>A full inquiry must be introduced into all aspects of this sadistic cruelty visited on children who, due to their circumstances, were placed in industrial schools. Until the full facts are known and the level of involvement of the various institutions, both lay and religious, are identified, we cannot begin to say how deeply we feel and how sorry and moved we are about what occurred, and begin to make restitution to the victims. Unfortunately, we can only pray for some whose suffering was ended by death, in many cases in mysterious circumstances.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and providing me with an opportunity to outline the Government's approach to the full range of issues relating to the abuse of children both in the past and today.</P>
      <P>The programme referred to by the Deputy examined with great skill and sensitivity the nature and extent of the abuse of children in industrial schools over many years. The programme makers are to be congratulated for their work, as are the victims, who with great bravery and dignity told their stories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> I visited Letterfrack last year and I was proud that the community had taken over the old industrial school and developed a community facility. However, if the walls of the school could talk, they would have some story to tell. I was taught by the religious and, in recent times particularly, the work of priests, brothers and nuns has been underestimated and forgotten. I congratulate and thank all the religious who did an enormous amount of good down through the years.</P>

      <P>That is why the Deputy is so articulate. However, as in other institutions, there, unfortunately, are bad apples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This area, as the Taoiseach has explained to the House, is one which the Government has been considering in depth. Through a special sub-committee of the Cabinet, chaired by the Minister for Education and Science, the Government has been determined to develop proposals which will <Col N="84" /> address all of the issues relating to abuse in a comprehensive and appropriate manner. The sub-committee's work has been undertaken on the basis of meeting the needs and wishes of the victims of abuse and seeking to ensure that such abuse as continues in our society is properly tackled. An element of this is that victims want a means to tell their story and have the truth recorded.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee's recommendations will be presented to Cabinet next week and it is intended that an extensive statement on behalf of the Government will be made next week, which is an indication of the serious consideration being given to the issue by the Government. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not open to me to seek to pre-empt such decisions as the Cabinet may take. However, I assure him that his views and those of other members of the House will be fully considered by the Cabinet during its discussions.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental working group established by the Minister for Education and Science and myself submitted its interim report on 31 July 1998. Both my colleague and I, and our respective officials have been considering the various issues raised in the interim report.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in my answer to previous questions there are still important issues to be decided in relation to the proposed academy. Principal among these are; the disciplines and skills that need to be encompassed in the new institution to answer the needs of the performing arts in Ireland at the beginning of the next millennium and; whether it will be possible or not to locate the academy in the Earlsfort Terrace building which is currently owned by University College Dublin.</P>
      <P>In relation to the first point, I can say that, while the interdepartmental working group in its interim report suggested broad parameters for the academy, the group stated in the report that further discussion was needed to identify the precise areas of specialised training required and indeed the precise model for an academy in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science and I, believe it would be both useful and productive to have a more widespread public discussion at this stage on the proposed academy for the performing arts. I and my colleague both recognise that while the working group endeavoured to bring forward recommendations on the scope of the academy it was not possible for them to do other than to suggest broad parameters without engaging in detail with practitioners, tutors and others. We strongly agree that more discussion and consultation is required and we are pursuing this.</P>
      <P>Formal consultations and meetings will be arranged with those involved in the teaching and practice of the performing arts. This will be with a view to bringing forward recommendations on the disciplines to be given priority in the proposed academy and the standards of qualifications and recognition. Since the submission of the report our officials have been independently looking at the possible scope and model for an academy and this work will inform the consultations with the practitioners I have just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> In relation to the location of the academy, UCD have recently put proposals to the Department of Education and Science as to the manner in which the Earlsfort Terrace premises might be transferred for use as an academy building. These proposals are currently being examined.</P>
    <P>I should say that the proposed academy will not seek to supplant or undermine existing colleges or institutions which have already achieved academic or international qualification status. I would hope that we would have exciting cross-fertilisation between the academy and other institutions.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is that the importance of Bull Island for our natural heritage is fully recognised by the various ecological designations it has attracted or that are proposed for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986 the island was designated a special protection area under the EU Birds Directive. My Department has also included it as part of the North Dublin Bay proposed candidate special <Col N="87" /> area of conservation, a designation category under the EU Habitats Directive. It is also proposed for designation as a natural heritage area. Most of the island is managed by Dublin Corporation as a nature reserve. In 1986 the island was designated a sister reserve to Polar Bear Pass, a national wildlife area, by the Canadian wildlife service, in recognition of its international importance for brent geese. The island is also a designated world biosphere reserve, a biogenetic reserve, a corine biotope site, a ramsar site and a wildfowl sanctuary.</P>
    <P>A contract ecologist engaged by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, recently visited Bull Island as part of the conservation planning process. This visit involved an examination of the islands ecology. A plan to ensure the conservation of the island ecology will now be drafted and reviewed by Dúchas. The plan itself will not be completed until after full public consultation has taken place.</P>
    <P>The many ecological designations applied to, and proposed for application to, the island will indicate to the Deputy the recognition by my Department of the importance attached to the natural heritage of Bull Island.</P>

      <P>While it will be appreciated by the Deputy that the acquisitions policy of the National Gallery is a matter for the gallery itself under statute, I am glad to inform him that since I took office the overall funding for the gallery has increased by almost 13 per cent.</P>
      <P>Funding resources for the various institutions which come within the remit of my Department, including the National Gallery, are decided having regard to the overall financial resources available to the core collecting institutions of the State. Historically many of these institutions have not had sufficient resources to maximise their potential in the way they should in Irish society. However within these constraints, funding provided by the State by way of separate vote to the National Gallery including staff costs is £2.396 million in 1999. This does not include significant expenditure through the Vote of the Office of Public Works on developing the National Gallery, nor the combination of Exchequer and EU funds made available directly to the Gallery itself for the major Clare Street extension project, which is currently under way and which will cost approximately £16.0 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, the gallery is entitled to avail of a tax relief provision which is designed to encourage donations or heritage works of art to our core collecting institutions. Through this measure, I am pleased to say that the National Gallery has received important donations of significant art works, most recently the sculpture titled Amorino by Antonio Canova.</P>
      <P>Apart from the State's contribution to the National Gallery, the gallery itself generates income from a number of sources, notably from the George Bernard Shaw and Sir Hugh Lane bequests, and from the gallery shop and restaurant. Taken as a whole the gallery has substantial resources at its disposal, although by international standards, the amount of resources must still be considered modest.</P>

      <P>I have announced the terms of a compensation package for the cessation of turfcutting in raised bogs proposed for designation as special areas of conservation. Bogs proposed for designation in the Deputy's constituency fall into this category. The main provisions of this package provide for a payment of £1,300 per acre for turbary and fee simple, £1,100 per acre for turbary only and in each case, the amount of compensation will be increased by a single additional payment of £1,000 where the applicant agrees to cease cutting turf before the commencement of the current turf cutting season which has been notionally set at 31st May 1999. A streamlined scheme which should allow for early payment of compensation has been devised and advertised in local newspapers. Under this scheme payment of compensation will be made primarily on the basis of an affadavit sworn by the land-turbary owner or the person claiming traditional rights to turfcutting.</P>
      <P>Turfcutting in areas of bog which are outside proposed special areas of conservation may continue as before.</P>

      <P>My Department is at present examining the possibility of implementing a language strategy in certain Gaeltacht areas on a pilot basis. Such a strategy would involve inter alia the identification of the problems and difficulties facing the language in the Gaeltacht, possible remedies for these problems and the implementation of a plan of action. While appropriate research would of course be an integral part of such a project, I have no plans at present to commission specific research for the purpose of assessing the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>In regard to the position of spoken Irish outside the Gaeltacht, I understand from Bord na Gaeilge that it regularly commissions Irish marketing surveys to include questions relating to attitudes, ability and use of Irish in a national omnibus survey. The most recent one &ndash; in December 1998 &ndash; confirms a fairly stable situation with about 11 per cent speaking Irish daily (or several times a week).</P>
      <P>The board also regularly collects data on various aspects of the use of Irish by public bodies. For example, a recent report noted a 7 per cent increase to 47 per cent in the number of bodies conducting business through Irish with the public.</P>
      <P>An expert group was established by the board in 1998 under the chairmanship of Professor P. Ó Riagáin of ITE, to give advice on research matters relating to Irish. I understand that the board is presently examining the research needs for the promotion of Irish in an all Ireland context.</P>

      <P>While I consider that the provision of a satisfactory legal framework for <Col N="93" /> our national parks and historic properties remains a necessity, I have decided that the issue is one to be developed within the context of the preparation of a national heritage plan, on which work is already under way. The plan will address the protection, conservation and presentation of the natural heritage, the architectural and archaeological heritage, the inland waterways of the State, and documentary and archival heritage. It will also review the existing situation in relation to the administrative and legislative arrangements for the national heritage and will set out strategies and actions for the future. I expect the national heritage plan to be published next year.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to announce on 18 April the awarding of the contract for the development of the new Irish folklife collection of the National Museum of Ireland at Turlough Park in Castlebar, County Mayo in association with Mayo County Council. Work is now beginning on this major project at a cost of £9 million in EU-Exchequer and county council funds, which will see the transfer of a substantial part of the folklife collection from storage in Daingean, County Offaly to new purpose-built facilities in County Mayo. As a project grant-aided with EU Structural Funds, the schedule of works envisages a completion date and opening to the public in the last quarter of 2000.</P>
      <P>Recruitment and transfer of staff to this facility will occur as necessary during the preparation period as determined by the management of the National Museum of Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, given by her to the motion passed by the South Dublin Council on 19 October 1998 asking that the Government provide funding to facilitate a full archaeological excavation to the lands and outbuildings adjacent to Rathfarnham Castle and to enable the council to restore the outbuildings and provide for their use by the local community in a manner compatible with the castle as a national monument; and the response to date forwarded by her to the council.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the motion passed by South Dublin County Council in October 1998 requesting my Department to fund a full archaeological excavation and restoration of the outbuildings at Rathfarnham Castle. My Department has no funds available to cover <Col N="94" /> the preservation of national monuments other than those in the ownership or guardianship of the State and the outbuildings at Rathfarnham Castle are largely owned by South Dublin County Council. I should add, however, that the State has undertaken substantial capital works at Rathfarnham Castle itself at a cost of some £2m to date.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of the proposal by Rathfarnham Courtyard Developments Limited to develop a modern hotel and bar complex on the site in question. Such a development is considered inappropriate as it demonstrates a lack of sensitivity for the National Monument status of Rathfarnham Castle and outbuildings and undermines the historical integrity of the demesne, which has already been seriously encroached on. Accordingly, my Department lodged a strong objection to the proposed development and planning permission was subsequently refused by the local authority. I understand that Rathfarnham Courtyard Developments Limited have now appealed this decision to An Bord Pleanála whose decision in the matter is awaited.</P>
      <P>My Department has entered into discussions with South Dublin County Council to try to agree a plan for this site which is mutually acceptable to all concerned. In the meantime, I am extremely concerned about the condition of the outbuildings which are in a severe state of dilapidation and I would urge South Dublin County Council to undertake urgent remedial works in consultation with my Department to prevent further deterioration of the buildings, given the National Monument status of the site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I took office I made the improvement of the quality of access to offshore islands one of my top priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998, my Department spent almost £0.7 million on the provision of subsidised ferry services to a number of offshore islands. A subsidised winter ferry service was introduced for the first time in 1994 serving Clare Island and Inishturk, County Mayo and Inishboffin, County Galway. In addition to this, after close consultation with the island communities concerned, a daily service was introduced serving the two smaller Aran Islands, Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr, thus improving significantly the level of service to these two islands. It is intended in 1999 to continue my Departments work on improving the availability of adequate transport between the islands and the mainland. This will involve a continued improvement of <Col N="95" /> ferry services together with the examination of access by air to some islands.</P>
    <P>Progress is also being made in the consideration of the application for the provision of a cable car to Inis Bigil.</P>
    <P>I also recently informed Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann that I hope to make decisions regarding the ferry services to the Cork islands by the end of June.</P>
    <P>My Department has also made a considerable investment in piers serving the offshore islands over the last few years. This included funding of over £1.7 million which I approved last year for the improvement of landing facilities on five islands off the County Cork coast and expenditure of almost £0.9 million on the continuation of major marine works on Tory Island. It is my intention to continue my Department's investment in both pier infrastructure and access services in order to further improve the quality of access available to offshore islands.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Heritage Council, which is an independent statutory body, has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the heritage. Under this remit, the council administers a community based heritage grants scheme. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, I have no function in relation to decisions by it on the disbursal of grants under this scheme or any other scheme administered by the council. I was, however, pleased to be able to increase funding for the Heritage Council from £4 million in 1998 to £5.08 million in the current year, an increase of 27 per cent.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna 28, 32 agus 40 le chéile.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the Heritage Council had advised that it supported the proposal of the Asgard restoration group to restore the vessel. The council advised at that time that it was not envisaged that the vessel would ever be sufficiently seaworthy to undertake the more rigorous programme of sail training again, but that it could form a floating exhibit at a suitable maritime exhibition area, with the possibility of bringing it occasionally by sea to particular events.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, owing to divergent views on the treatment of the Asgard, the council, in seeking to formulate its most recent advice established a special working group which engaged in a broader-based consultative process.</P>
      <P>The council has now recommended that the ideal situation for the boat is its full conservation, display and interpretation as a land-based exhibit in a suitable location. The council states that this would allow the preservation for a maximum amount of original material while also providing the opportunity for an exciting exploration of the multi-layered heritage of the vessel.</P>
      <P>In relation to the possible annual costs mentioned arising in the event of the vessel being conserved, it should be noted that the future treatment of the vessel under the National Monuments Acts has yet to be decided and any costings in advance of these decisions are, by their very nature, highly speculative.</P>
      <P>The issue of the sources of private funds that might be available for the restoration to a sea-going standard and the maintenance of this vessel by the Asgard restoration group does not fall within my remit. This would be a matter for consideration by my colleague the Minister for Defence, who is the owner of the vessel, at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>I am currently awaiting the advice of the National Museum of Ireland regarding an application for a licence, under the National Monuments Acts, for the restoration of the vessel by the Asgard restoration project. It would be inappropriate to comment further on this matter until this advice has been tendered and considered.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Heritage Council is a statutory autonomous body established under the Heritage Act, 1995. Under this Act, the Council has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the built heritage. I would point out, however, that, while I provide operational funding to the Heritage Council under my Department's vote, I have no function in relation to the council's decisions on the disbursement of funds.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that last year I and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, announced a package of measures for the protection of the architectural heritage. Among these measures is the establishment of a new grant-aid scheme for approved conservation works to listed buildings, which will commence very soon. The new grants scheme will be administered by the local authorities. It will have funding of £4 million per annum and will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards drawn up by an advisory group made up of our two Departments and the Heritage Council.</P>
      <P>While my Department would have no direct function in addressing the case of the round tower in question, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, may be of assistance by providing some technical advice and guidance as to the type of works which would be appropriate. The local community should contact Dúchas in this regard as, in any event, this monument is protected under the National Monuments Acts and I would have to be consulted prior to any work of restoration being undertaken.</P>

      <P>The State already has a sizeable portfolio over 700 of national monuments and historic properties in its care, which is placing an ever-increasing strain on the resources at my disposal to maintain and manage such properties. Therefore, for heritage properties generally I favour private ownership as much as possible so that they can be put to appropriate uses and their tourism potential can be maximised in an appropriate manner.</P>
      <P>As for those heritage properties in my care, my Department is involved in thirty three projects which are mainly of a conservation nature and which range from stately homes such as Castletown House, County Kildare to castles such as Trim Castle, County Meath and Barryscourt Castle, County Cork. The current works programme will result in a capital spend of about £30 million on the 33 projects concerned. The programme is supported by the European Union under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 and there is, therefore, a clear tourism potential therein. When the programme is completed, a significant addition will have been made to both the peak and off-peak tourism attractions throughout the State.</P>
      <P>In the next round of Structural Funds my Department will be considering proposals for a further programme of tourism-related projects which will be primarily aimed at the conservation and presentation of National Monuments and Historic Properties in State care, in keeping with my remit as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that I and my officials will be doing our utmost to maximise the benefits from the next round of capital funding while ensuring that the overriding priority of conserving our built heritage is met.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the proposed legislation consultation with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the organisers of events, broadcasters and the general public will be required before an order designating events can be made. The order will also have to be ratified by both Houses <Col N="99" /> before it comes into force. I will begin the consultation process as soon as the Bill is enacted and I believe that it would not be helpful to specify particular events in advance of this process.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated to the House it is my intention that all island communities will have adequate and suitable access to the mainland. My Department is in the process of finalising a comprehensive analysis of the access requirements of all our populated offshore islands. As the Deputy is aware I announced capital funding last year of over £1.7 million towards access infrastructure for the inhabited islands off the coast of County Cork.</P>
      <P>I hope to be in a position to make a decision with regard to the subsidisation of ferry services for the islands in question by the end of June. The Deputy is aware that the ferry services to Oileán Chléire are already being subsidised. It is my intention that subsidies will be provided elsewhere as necessary after public advertisement inviting tenders for the provision of those services.</P>

    <P>I have now approved a first phase of the Maynooth Castle restoration project. This phase in itself is a stand alone project and involves the development of the ground floor vaulted areas for exhibition purposes together with access to the first floor and provision of small scale guide <Col N="100" /> and visitor facilities. It is intended to commence the first phase of the restoration works in the latter half of 1999 and to complete them before the end of the year 2000.</P>
    <P>A provision of £1 million has been made in my Department's Estimates for this project of which 75 per cent is being funded by the European Union's Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999. This provision is considered adequate to meet the requirements of the works outlined.</P>
    <P>The remaining phase of the overall restoration scheme will be considered in the light of available resources to my Department after the year 2000 when the first phase is completed. It is not possible at this stage to give firm estimates of cost in relation to such future works.</P>
    <P>Officials from Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, met with representatives of the Maynooth Castle restoration committee at the end of March and outlined the details of the first phase to them.</P>

      <P>A feasibility study into the re-opening of the Ulster canal, which was jointly commissioned by the Rivers Agency of Northern Ireland and Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, was published last August. This comprehensive study concluded that the re-opening of the Ulster canal is feasible but it would be a large engineering project estimated to cost some £68.4 million sterling, at 1997 prices, and the works stage alone would take at least four years.</P>
      <P>In publishing this study, I stated that, while it could open the way to an imaginative joint restoration project with benefits to communities on both sides of the border, there are major financial, legal and environmental considerations to be addressed by both Governments.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement Act, 1999 recently passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas but yet to be brought into force pending the setting up of the Northern Ireland Executive, provides for the establishment of Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body for inland waterways, and one of its immediate functions will be to &ldquo;take forward appropriate studies and appraisals in relation to the possible restoration of the Ulster canal&rdquo;. I believe that this is the appropriate mechanism for progressing the matter and I hope that Waterways Ireland can come into existence at an early date.</P>
      <P>My Northern counterpart will be the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure who has yet to be appointed and I look forward to working with the person appointed in the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>

The restocking of grouse on areas from which they have disappeared is unlikely to be successful unless the factors causing the decline have been identified and rectified. Widespread overgrazing and the lack of effective predator control are considered important in this context. There has been a substantial decline in numbers since the 1920s as a result of the break-up of the sporting estates. From a conservation perspective, under section 24 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, the hunting season for grouse is limited to the month of September. However, I understand that the National Association of Regional Game Councils recently applied to the Heritage Council under the wildlife grant scheme to undertake a census count of this species with a view to establishing baseline information for future long-term studies and a grant of £10,000 has been made available under this scheme. For the purposes of this count Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department issued a licence under section 29(C) of the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>The burning of vegetation, including heather, in the countryside is already regulated by legislation. Under section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 subject to certain exceptions it is an offence to burn vegetation on uncultivated land between 15 April and 31 August. The burning of heather to stimulate fresh growth is considered a low priority on blanket bog and also conflicts with other conservation interests. On heath, particularly in the east of the country it is considered a valuable management technique for grouse but too difficult to control on a large enough scale to be effective.</P>

Currently, there are 53 cases before the board for consideration. Earlier, one of the impediments to the progress of the board's work was the fact that there was no financial aid available to appellants who, must under the terms of the European Community (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, make appeals on scientific grounds only. I have now arranged for financial assistance to be made available to deserving appellants through the board and with its prior approval.</P>

      <P>The project referred to and which was described in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 14 April, is an initiative being developed by Cardiff University for that city's local authority. I understand that it involves the collection of data on four main energy using sectors namely domestic, non-domestic, industry and transport. This will enable city planners to assess the impact of actions such as grants for the insulation of domestic dwellings on energy use and related emissions. The impact assessment will be carried out using a computer model which when completed will allow city planners to assess the costs and benefits of any planned new initiatives.</P>
      <P>I am following such developments which may have application here. In the meantime, there is a number of completed and ongoing studies of energy consumption levels by various agencies in Ireland. I draw your attention to a similar study recently completed by the City of Dublin Energy Management Agency in November 1998, entitled Dublin City Energy Balance. This study is part of CODEMA's objective of identifying the actual energy usage in Dublin city and contributing to the sustainable development of the city through the promotion of increased efficiency. I encourage local authorities and local energy management agencies to undertake such studies to both inform local policy makers and ultimately my own officials in the development of national policy in this area in response to Kyoto and Local Agenda 21 energy issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another example is the domestic insulation agency Energy Action, funded by my Department. Energy Action has commissioned a research report entitled The Cost of Heating Ireland from UCD. The aim of the report is to develop an affordable domestic energy conser<Col N="108" /> vation strategy to upgrade all housing stock to 1997 Building Regulation standards. As part of their house insulation programme, Energy Action also maintains a database on clients energy consumption and other energy related topics. Information on over 1,200 houses has already been collected in Dublin.</P>
    <P>On a broader level, an important related development will be the early publication of my Green Paper on Sustainable Energy. This will establish a new framework policy for energy efficiency and the use of renewables in Ireland. I will be focusing on necessary measures to promote energy efficiency among targeted consumers such as residential consumers, small businesses, government and local authority offices, schools, health boards and hospitals. The role of industry, transport and the power sector will also be addressed. In preparing the paper, I am drawing upon research and experience such as the Cardiff project and I will set out policies appropriate to Irish circumstances.</P>

      <P>To avail of the relief provided by section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, the owner or occupier of the building must apply to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for a determination that the building is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest. Having obtained that determination he/she must then obtain a determination from the Revenue Commissioners that the building is one to which reasonable access is afforded to the public. Therefore I am providing, in response to the Deputy's question, a list of properties supplied by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of which the Commissioners granted a determination in relation to access and which could accordingly avail or have availed of the relevant tax concession.</P>
      <P>There is also certain relief available from capital acquisitions tax. Under the provisions of section 39 of the Finance Act, 1978, an exemption from capital acquisitions tax can be granted for a house or garden situated in the State which is not held for the purposes of trading where it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioners to be of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest. To qualify for relief the section requires that reasonable facilities for viewing on a continuous basis be allowed to members of the public during the three years immediately preceding the gift or inheritance. The claim for the exemption arises at the time of the gift or inheritance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the properties which have availed of the capital acquisitions tax exemption since January 1994 are as follows:</P>

At that time records were not kept in a manner which allows such cases to be readily identified. The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they are having further inquiries made in respect of these cases and will make the details available as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to change the income tax reliefs for seafarers which were introduced in 1998 and extended in the 1999 Finance Act. These reliefs are as follows. The 1998 Finance Act provided for a new seafarers tax allowance of £5,000 per annum. This allowance is available in respect of seafaring earnings, and is conditional on a seafarer being at sea on a voyage to or from a foreign port for at least 169 days in a tax year on a passenger or cargo ship which is registered in an EU member state's shipping register. The 1998 Finance Act also allowed voyages to offshore servicing installations outside Irish waters to be allowable for the purposes of this seafarers tax allowance. This allowance has now been extended in the 1999 Finance Act to the crews of vessels servicing such rigs within Irish waters.</P>
      <P>Certain long-haul seafarers, who do not meet the requirements outlined above, may qualify under the foreign earnings deduction scheme (FED) which applies generally to any persons working abroad for a substantial part of the year. To qualify for this deduction an employee must spend at least 90 qualifying days abroad in a tax year or 12 month period, and each period of absence must be for a minimum of 14 days at a time. A long-haul seafarer can claim either the seafarer allowance or the FED, but not both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The FED does not apply to the UK due, <i>inter alia</i>, to its proximity and the fact that extension <Col N="116" /> to the UK would bring Northern Ireland within its scope, leading to possible abuse which would be difficult to control. However, I did make an exception last year to cater for the special circumstances faced by seafarers on long-haul voyages who happen to make an incidental stop en route at a UK port. This concession is, therefore, consistent with the overall aim of the deduction as already outlined.</P>
    <P>The Irish shipping sector is in a position to avail of an attractive mix of incentives. These incentives cover both employers and employees and include not only the 1998 and 1999 Finance Acts measures outlined above but also the employers' PRSI exemption that currently applies to the Irish maritime transport sector. These provisions are also consistent with the European Commission's guidelines on State aids to the maritime transport sector and I believe that the measures will help improve the competitive position of the Irish shipping sector in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would explain that under the normal income tax system, an individual taxpayer is entitled to have certain allowances and reliefs taken into account in calculating, their tax liability. Any income greater than the sum total of the allowances and reliefs is then taxed at 24 per cent and-or 46 per cent as appropriate. Such allowances include the personal allowances &ndash; single or married allowances, age allowance, PAYE allowance, blind allowance, etc. &ndash; and reliefs such as that for health expenses, medical insurance, qualifying rent relief etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternatively, if more favourable to the taxpayer, he-she may be taxed under the exemption limits-marginal relief system. Under this system individuals are provided with exemption limits, which are higher than the normal personal allowances, and are taxed at 40 per cent on all income above the exemption limits until their level of income is such that it would be more favourable to be taxed under the normal tax system. However, the exemption limits displace the normal personal allowances and reliefs, including medical insurance relief. For historical reasons people on exemption limits-marginal relief continue to be eligible for mortgage interest relief subject to the usual conditions. It must be stressed that if you are being taxed under the <Col N="117" /> marginal relief system you are in fact paying less tax than if you were being taxed under the normal tax system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that those aged 65 and over are treated more favourably under the income tax code than the generality of taxpayers. The exemption limits for those aged 65 and over are significantly higher than those which apply generally. In the last two budgets, I have implemented substantial improvements in the tax treatment of the elderly. In the 1999 budget I introduced a unified income tax exemption limit of £6,500 single &ndash; £13,000 married for all those aged 75 and over. This represents an increase of £1,500 single, £3,000 married for those aged 65 to 74 and an increase of £1,000 single, £2,000 married for those aged 75 and over. The new age exemption limit compares favourably with the general exemption limits of £4,100 single-£8,200 married. The large increase in income exemption limits for the elderly announced in Budget 1999 will remove 15,000 elderly persons from the tax net.</P>

      <P>With effect from 1 July 1999, the existing drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes will be merged into one new drug payment scheme. The primary aim of this scheme is to bring about important improvements in the existing schemes by effectively merging the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new family scheme will have significant advantages over the existing drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, families and indi<Col N="119" /> viduals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. Many families and individuals have very heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and have to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter before they receive a refund. This can cause considerable cash flow problems for a significant number of families and individuals. This will not happen under the new drug payment scheme. From the introduction of the new scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines. It means that families and individuals will, for the first time, be able to budget for the cost of medicines. Families and individuals will know that, whatever the size of their drugs bill, they will not have to pay more than £42 per month. In addition, there are families where, although one member may qualify for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card, combined expenditure on medicines by other members, which can be considerable, cannot be recouped until the end on the quarter. With the new drug payment scheme, no family will have to pay more than £42 in any month for prescribed medicines. The new scheme will be of significant benefit to such families.</P>
    <P>The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the current drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example in one month have expenditure of say £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
    <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion on the new drug payment scheme and as such, this scheme is open to everyone. Where expenditure by a family or an individual exceeds £42 per month on prescribed medicines, the balance will be met by the State. This is in contrast to the old DCSS scheme, where patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
    <P>Individuals or families availing of the new drug payment scheme should register with the relevant health board. Registration forms, containing information on the scheme, have been circulated to every household. In addition, registration forms have been issued to patients currently claiming under the existing schemes. Additional registration forms will also be available in community pharmacies and general practitioners' surgeries. Public notices have been placed in the national newspapers regarding the scheme and it is intended to place further public notices. Posters advertising the scheme will also be supplied for display in health centres, community pharmacies and general practitioner surgeries. It will of course be possible to register after 1 July 1999 and to avail of the benefits of the scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department has published the traffic signs manual (1996) as a comprehensive guide to the provision of road signage in Ireland. It prescribes the design of all road signs and the standards required to ensure that road users are given messages clearly and in good time. Use of the manual is intended over time to lead to greater uniformity of practice and to the creation of a more consistent approach to signing generally.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority (NRA) has been co-ordinating the signage and delineation of the national roads network. In 1995, the NRA embarked on a major programme of improvement to directional signing and lining throughout the network of national primary roads. Expenditure on the programme up to the end of 1998 is almost £10 million and a further £4 million is being provided this year. At this stage the improvement programme for national primary routes has been completed and work has commenced on national secondary roads, with a view to completion by end 2002.</P>
      <P>Individual road authorities are directly responsible for the provision, maintenance and funding of signposting and roadway markings on non-national roads, either through their own resources and/or through discretionary grants made available by my Department. Approximately £23 million has been allocated to county councils in discretionary grants this year, while the discretionary block grant allocation to urban authorities is £9.750 million. My Department wrote to all road authorities in August 1998 reminding them of the need to bring signage up to the standards set out in the traffic signs manual as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has been no direct approach to my Department by the Irish Hotels Federation in <Col N="121" /> relation to this issue, I understand that there has been contact between the federation and the National Roads Authority and that the specific concerns raised by the federation are being addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The old age (contributory) pension scheme was introduced on 6 January 1961, in accordance with the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960. This was the first major extension to the range of contingencies covered, following the unification of the various insurance codes into a new system of social insurance on 5 January 1953.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 164 of 21 April, prior to 1953 coverage for &ldquo;social-insurance-type&rdquo; benefits was provided by way of three different types of contributions which gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid, namely: national health insurance, which provided cover for sickness benefit, maternity benefit and disablement benefit; widow's and orphan's insurance, which provided cover for contributory widow's and orphan's pensions; and uemployment insurance, which provided cover for unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>At the same time as the introduction of the old age (contributory) pension scheme, the rate of social insurance contribution was increased to include an element towards the funding of the new pension scheme. Contributions paid prior to 1961 did not include any such element. However, it was decided to count all contributions paid under the unified scheme &ndash; i.e. from January 1953 &ndash; towards qualification for the new pension.</P>
      <P>Special provisions were introduced for people who had already reached pension age or who were close to reaching pension age (which, at that time, was 70) when the old age (contributory) pension scheme came into operation. These measures permitted certain contributions paid before 1953, under the national health insurance acts, to be taken into account for the &lsquo;yearly average' test for anyone born before 5 January 1903.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, provision was made that contributions paid before 1953, under the national health insurance acts, could be taken into account for the purposes of satisfying the first two qualifying conditions under the old age (contributory) pension scheme; that is, that a person must have <Col N="123" /> (a) entered insurance ten years before pension age; and (b) have, at least, 156 social insurance contributions paid since first entering insurance.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind these concessions was to extend coverage for the new pension scheme to as many insured people as possible. If, for example, entitlement to the OACP had been confined solely to social insurance contributions which included a pension element &ndash; i.e. social insurance contributions paid since 1961 &ndash; ten years would have elapsed from the date of introduction of the new scheme before anyone could have qualified. This would have meant that the first old age (contributory) pension would not have been payable until 1971.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have often stated my commitment to ensuring that contributory pension coverage is as widely available as possible. The Department is undertaking a detailed review of the contribution conditions applying to the old age (contributory) and retirement pensions and, as part of this, is reviewing the use of contributions paid prior to 1953 for the purpose of satisfying the &lsquo;yearly average' qualifying condition.</P>

      <P>I introduced a range of measures in the 1999 budget, at an additional annual cost of over £18 million, to improve and develop the position of carers. These measures, which are set out below, were based on a detailed examination of the review of the carer's allowance, which I published in October 1998.</P>
      <P>The main improvements include: the extension of the carer's allowance to carers of children in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance (DCA); the extension of the carer's allowance to carers of all people between 16 and 65 who require full-time care and attention; an annual payment of £200 as a contribution towards respite care to all qualified carers; the extension of the free telephone rental allowance to all qualified carers; the relaxation of the residency conditions for receipt of carer's allowance; the relaxation of the full-time care and attention conditions for receipt of carer's allowance; the amendment of the means test to give carers income disregards in their own right; the introduction of measures to ensure that carers' social insurance records are preserved; the extension of the free travel scheme to all qualified carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above measures the carer's allowance will increase in June this year by £3 per week for recipients of the allowance who are <Col N="124" /> under age 66 and by £6 per week for those who are over age 66. This represents an increase of 4.1 per cent and 7.9 per cent respectively on current rates.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1999 provides for the extension of the carer's allowance to carers of those between the ages of 16 and 65 and to carers of children in receipt of DCA, the increase in the rates of carer's allowance, the annual respite care payment and the improvement to the means test. Regulations covering the other improvements will be introduced in the next few months as these improvements take place.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions No. 320 of 9 March and No. 477 of 23 March. In relation to the amount of grant aid sanctioned by Údarás na Gaeltachta for the company involved as I have previously stated details of the financial assistance sanctioned and paid by an tÚdarás will be published in the normal way in that body's annual report and accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> Following an assessment of the proposed development by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, I am satisfied that the type of activity proposed by this development will not adversely affect the conservation value of the candidate special area of conservation nor will it have a significant negative impact on the environment therein. In granting planning permission recently for this proposed development I note that the county council took on board the concerns of Dúchas by omitting the proposal to develop a playing pitch on the site of an intact priority habitat and I am satisfied with this.</P>

      <P>The Irish language will be promoted in 1999, in so far as its promotion relates to the functions of my Department, through the schemes of assistance operated by the Department itself, both within and outside the Gaeltacht, through the activities of the State boards under its aegis &ndash; particularly Údarás na Gaeltachta, Bord na Gaeilge and Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge &ndash; and through the work of the voluntary Irish language organisations which are assisted financially by my Department.</P>
      <P>While I would not advert to it as a special promotion, work is proceeding in my Department on Bille na Gaeilge, which will be the most significant legislative measure proposed in relation to the language since the foundation of the State and will I hope have a very positive impact on the use of Irish.</P>

      <P>The premises of the National Museum of Ireland at Kildare Street, Merrion Street and Collins Barracks are open to the public each week between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Tuesday to Saturday and between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Sunday. They are closed to the public on Mondays and also on Christmas Day and Good Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 14 on 15 October 1998 the National Museum favours the extension of opening hours to improve access by the public. As I pointed out then, such an <Col N="126" /> extension would have major financial and human resource implications. I understand that the management of the National Museum has had preliminary discussions with the relevant staff interests and that further discussions will be taking place with the view to reaching agreement on extending opening hours.</P>
    <P>The total number of visitors to the National Museum in 1998 is estimated at 815,000, made up of 420,000 to Kildare Street, 205,000 to Collins Barracks and 190,000 to Merrion Street (Natural History).</P>

      <P>I understand that there are four separate national schools in Belgrove, Clontarf as follows: Eoin Baisde junior boys &ndash; Roll No. 19006; Eoin Baisde infants girls &ndash; Roll No. 19007; Eoin Baisde senior girls &ndash; Roll No. 17148; and Eoin Baisde senior boys &ndash; Roll No.17936.</P>
      <P>My Department's guidelines on maximum class size for the current school year are as follows: 35 in the case of a single-grade class-group; 34 in the case of a class-group of two consecutive grades; 31 in the case of multi-grade class-group; 29 in the case of disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>The existing complement of teaching staff in each of the four schools is based on the enrolment of each school on 30 September 1997. There seems to be no reason why classes in each of these schools cannot be organised in compliance with the above maximum class size guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that last month I announced that all primary schools will operate to a maximum class average of 30 pupils in the 1999-2000 school year. As a result of these improved staffing arrangements, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that three of the schools in question &ndash; Eoin Baisde Junior Boys, Eoin <Col N="132" /> Baisde Infants Girls and Eoin Baisde Senior Boys &ndash; will qualify for an additional teaching post from September 1999.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses of which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual higher education grants scheme which I approve sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. The <Col N="134" /> approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly-funded third level institutions. However, there are a number of religious and other institutions that have been admitted to the scheme over the years.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Irish School of Ecumenics offers two courses at postgraduate level in ecumenical studies and peace studies, with the awards being made by Trinity College Dublin. I further understand that the school is in formal discussions with Trinity College Dublin, with a view to a more structured relationship with the college. The higher education grants scheme is reviewed annually and I have asked my officials to consider the position of the Irish School of Ecumenics in that context, having regard to any developments in relation to the school.</P>
    <P>My Department allocated £100,000 to the Irish School of Ecumenics in 1995. Since then, significant allocations have been made. In 1997 and 1998, grants of £270,000 and £250,000 respectively were paid to the institute. Provision has also been made for a grant of £250,000 to the institute for 1999.</P>

      <P>Courses approved under the free fees initiative are full-time undergraduate courses, other than ESF aided courses in the institutes of technology, which are followed in one of the approved colleges. The courses must, other than exceptionally, be of a minimum of two years duration. As the BA in community studies is not a full-time course it is not an approved course for the purposes of the free fees initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> Similarly, under the terms of the third level student support schemes, eligible students must be pursuing approved full-time third level courses.</P>
    <P>In their report, the steering committee on the future development of higher education referred to the profile of part-time students and noted that almost 90 per cent were in employment. In this context, I would point out that tax relief is available at the standard rate, under section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses. I understand that this course has been approved for tax relief.</P>

It is envisaged that, at the end of the five-year period, every school in the country will have access to an educational psychological service.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service will be organised in close collaboration with the services provided by the clinical agencies of the health boards. This is in order to minimise delay and to ensure efficient co-ordination of the assistance to be offered to children and their families.</P>
