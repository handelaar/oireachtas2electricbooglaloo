    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all of its aspects remains the key priority of the Government's Northern Ireland policy. We are working closely with the British Government and pro-Agreement parties in the North to achieve this objective. In a little under a year, considerable progress has been made.</P>
      <P>The institutional, equality and human rights aspects of the Agreement were passed into law at Westminster last November. The Assembly on 16 February approved the report of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on the number and demarcation of Government Departments which the Executive will oversee. On the same occasion, it also endorsed proposals relating to the other institutions.</P>
      <P>On 1 March, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland circulated the Standing Orders covering the d'Hondt procedure under which members of the Executive will be appointed. She has indicated that it is her intention to trigger the procedure in the Assembly this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a major step forward, on 8 March the Secretary of State and I signed four supplementary international agreements providing for the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council, the six North-South implementation bodies, the <Col N="1282" /> British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British Irish Council. These agreements were approved and the legislation required to establish the implementation bodies was passed in the Oireachtas and at Westminster later that week. They were signed by the President on 22 March.</P>
    <P>Work on the implementation of other aspects of the Agreement is also continuing. The Human Rights Commission is up and running in the North. Work on the draft legislation to establish a human rights commission in this jurisdiction is well advanced. The Patten Commission on the future of policing, the Criminal Justice Review and the International Commission on Decommissioning are all continuing with their work.</P>
    <P>All the necessary provisions are now in place for the institutions under the Agreement to &lsquo;go live' once the current impasse over the formation of the Executive and decommissioning has been resolved. We are working intensively with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties in the search for a way forward. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs had a series of valuable bilateral meetings in Belfast last week, and the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister arrived there last night. I have just come from our discussions and will return to Belfast shortly after Question Time. I am fully convinced all the pro-Agreement parties are totally dedicated to finding an honourable way forward. However, it will be appreciated that, at this most delicate moment in the process, it would not be helpful for me to go into detail on our discussions.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution to the current impasse and, as the Taoiseach has indicated, accommodation can only be found if everyone shows flexibility and willingness to move from present positions. It took partnership, creativity and shared responsibility to reach agreement last Good Friday &ndash; my message, which remains the same to all parties, is to approach the current negotiations in exactly the same spirit, and I believe that is happening.</P>
    <P>The challenges we face this week are daunting, but we must find a means to overcome them. There is simply no alternative. As President Clinton rightly said, failure is not an option. The vicious murder of Rosemary Nelson, and other recent incidents of violence, have highlighted once again that there must be no going back to the old ways. The people of Ireland want a future built on partnership and peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On my behalf and on behalf of my party, I wish the Minister and his colleagues well. We hope the talks will be fruitful and that everything will go well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House recognises the difficulties that decommissioning presents for the republican movement and welcomes the IRA's identification of the burial sites of disappeared persons. In the interests of humanity, we hope the burial places of the remaining disappeared persons will <Col N="1283" /> become known. The House favours the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, including the release of prisoners. The House, on behalf of the people of the Republic, wants sanity in the republican movement. It recognises the difficulties the Unionists face and hopes for a generous response so that the impasse is broken and the Good Friday Agreement can be fully implemented.</P>
    <P>Are both sides adopting the flexible and creative approach for which the Taoiseach hoped so that progress can be made? Are the leaders of Sinn Féin stretching the republican constituency, as Mr. Adams promised on Capitol Hill? Does the Minister believe the d'Hondt system will be triggered this week leading to the setting up of the Northern Ireland executive?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for his opening remarks which are appreciated. There has been all-party support for the goal we are seeking to achieve over the next 36 to 48 hours. Since last evening, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister had intensive bilateral meetings. They also had intensive meetings with Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell and myself met Sinn Féin, the UUP and the SDLP. There were also other meetings.</P>
      <P>The message I can give to the House at this remove, having just come from Belfast and returning shortly, is one of hope. There is a mindset within the parties that this is the opportunity which must not be missed. I am hopeful. I cannot, in the context of the British Prime Minister's involvement with the obscenities taking place in the Balkans and other matters upon which he has to focus, see him staying in Belfast beyond tomorrow. I would like to think &ldquo;the business&rdquo; will be done by then. The message from me to you is one of hope, particularly with regard to the attitude of the parties yesterday evening.</P>
      <P>This morning there was a series of meetings, including one with the Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition and a joint meeting of the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach with a local school. The atmosphere is one of friendship and a wish for a solution to this terribly difficult problem.</P>
      <P>We accept the question of decommissioning is central to the whole problem of the impasse. We accept the Agreement does not contain a precondition that there must be a start to decommissioning before Sinn Féin can take its place in the Executive. Given the size of its mandate, under the terms of the Agreement, Sinn Féin is entitled to two places in that Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is equally a reality that the UUP interprets the Agreement in a different way. Its understanding is that the participation of Sinn Féin in the Executive requires a start to decommissioning. These are the realities we as a Government must face and the realities we and the British Government must overcome. We have succeeded in get<Col N="1284" /> ting this far by finding solutions with which all sides can live and we now must do the same with the present impasse. We do not, however, have much time to do that.</P>
    <P>The parties to the Agreement, in their wisdom, established a mechanism to deal with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning under General John de Chastelain. This is seen as the way forward by all sides, including Mr. David Trimble and Mr. Gerry Adams. The task now is to help General de Chastelain find the formula to unblock that impasse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, in wishing the Minister, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister well in their task of seeking a compromise on the issue of decommissioning. I thank the Minister for travelling back to the Dáil to take Question Time today.</P>
      <P>Does he agree the problem derives from an uncertainty on the part of Sinn Féin about whether it can carry its organisation with it if it concedes on the issue of decommissioning, and an uncertainty on the part of David Trimble as to whether he can carry his party with him if he does not get a concession on decommissioning in advance of the establishment of an Executive? If that is a correct analysis, is the Minister in a position to outline the parameters of a compromise in overcoming those difficulties? Will he agree also that the decommissioning issue has been on the horizon from virtually the beginning of this process, that initially the Unionist position was that there would not be talks without decommissioning, that the Mitchell principles indicated there should be decommissioning during the course of negotiations &ndash; that did not happen &ndash; that the Agreement provides for it to happen within the two year period from the acceptance of the Agreement, that a year of that two year period has now passed, that David Trimble finds himself in the position of having to have some concession on this issue and that, therefore, it is critical that a compromise is found?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not giving the Deputy a short answer, because this is a matter of extreme seriousness, but it is a compromise that would meet the requirements of the parties and, more particularly, the UUP and Sinn Féin, and the broad parameters of what is necessary to enable the Good Friday Agreement to come into force. The Deputy is aware that all legislative arrangements are now in place to allow for the entry into force of the Good Friday Agreement. That will occur through an exchange of letters between the two Governments. As this is related to issuing a devolution order by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State transferring powers to the executive and the Assembly, the exchange of letters clearly cannot take place until the current impasse has been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what has been done, more particularly in the context of urging Sinn Féin to <Col N="1285" /> decommission, the Government has had a number of meetings with Sinn Féin representatives where the issue of decommissioning has been extensively explored and it has had many meetings with Sinn Féin on other issues, some of which have been resolved. We would welcome any progress on decommissioning and we would like to see progress in this area sooner rather than later, but this problem will only be resolved by give and take on both sides and we are, at this very moment, exploring all possibilities and options in this regard. I am grateful for the Deputy's remarks at the beginning of his intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the day that is in it, and the issue we are dealing with, I have no wish to cause any difficulties for the Minister or pursue questions which might be best left alone. On the murder of Rosemary Nelson, will the Minister agree it would help the atmosphere of any negotiations if not only is justice done but justice is seen to be done, and that the undertakings given in relation to a fully independent investigation of this murder are delivered on? Will the Minister confirm that progress is being made in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to tell the Deputy progress has been made. While I was not immediately party to the discussion between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister I was in the general area and entered the room on their invitation subsequently. The British Prime Minister is seized of the need, arising from the Taoiseach's intervention, for an open, transparent and accountable inquiry into the tragic death of Rosemary Nelson. I understand the Taoiseach, no later than today, may have either phoned Mr. Nelson or visited him; I think the former is the case but I am open to correction. I agree the inquiry must be and be perceived to be an independent inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that Sinn Féin should view decommissioning as a statement of its own self-confidence rather than a surrender? Does he also agree that decommissioning would be a demonstration of Sinn Féin's confidence in the democratic process and its crossing of the threshold into that process?</P>
      <P>When will the human rights commission in the Republic be operational? Does the Minister think the other ten &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; who have not been accounted for by the IRA are likely to be located? Is the IRA in a position to indicate where the bodies of these unfortunate people are located?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the Government's normal position to respond to questions on what the IRA may or may not do. However, the Deputy has asked a reasonable question and I will make an exception in this instance. Given the current atmosphere, it is hoped that the bodies of the ten &ldquo;disappeared&rdquo; will be recovered in the name of <Col N="1286" /> whatever God they pray to. We all wish the minds of their families to be at peace.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will shortly introduce legislation concerning the human rights commission. I would like to think that will be during the next session. I am grateful to the Deputy for pointing out that there is some urgency concerning this issue.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in Kosovo is extremely grave, giving rise to the most serious concern for the Albanian civilian population. I unreservedly condemn the latest atrocities reported from Kosovo. Since the outbreak of hostilities in Kosovo last year more than 500,000 people, more than one fifth of the population of Kosovo, have fled or been displaced from their homes. Up to 100,000 people have been driven from their homes in the past month and this tragic exodus is continuing today.</P>
      <P>Since the withdrawal of the Kosovo Verification Mission it is hard to get accurate or comprehensive information but it is clear that the civilian population continues to be the target of aggression by Serb forces. These attacks have sharply escalated following the action undertaken by NATO. There are new victims every day, with reports of summary executions and other atrocities and a continuing exodus to neighbouring countries. Because of the extremely dangerous conditions the delivery of aid to people on the move has become extremely difficult. All of this means that once again we are facing a large-scale humanitarian disaster as bad, or even worse, than that which arose last September, when tens of thousands of Kosovars fled as refugees to neighbouring countries.</P>
      <P>In previous statements to the House, I set out the development of the crisis over the last 12 months. I would recall, in particular, the decisions taken by the UN Security Council. On 23 September 1998 the council, acting under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, adopted Resolution 1199 calling for a cease-fire; the start of meaningful dialogue between the sides and the withdrawal of Serb security forces to pre-crisis levels. These demands were intended to stave off the humanitarian catastrophe facing those displaced from their homes.</P>
      <P>In the absence of any compliance by the Serb side, NATO threatened air strikes. These did not occur because President Milosevic reached agreement with US envoy Holbrooke on measures to implement Resolution 1199. This agreement was subsequently endorsed by Resolution 1203 of the Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the auspices of the contact group, negotiations at Rambouillet sought to advance a pol<Col N="1287" /> itical solution acceptable to both parties. It was understood that when these talks were suspended there was acceptance by both sides of the political elements. The Kosovo Albanians were prepared to accept, <i>ad referendum</i>, the implementation measures. However, when the talks resumed in Paris on 15 March, the Serb side tried to reopen a number of other issues. In the interim, they had also built up their security forces both within and on the borders of Kosovo, in violation of the terms of Resolution 1199 and the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement. With no prospect of further progress at Paris, the contact group decided to adjourn the talks, but not before the Kosovo Albanian side had signed the full text.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disappointed that further last minute efforts to persuade President Milosevic did not succeed. His flagrant violation of the provisions of Resolution 1199 and the threat of a new humanitarian catastrophe led directly to NATO carrying out its threat of air strikes. The international community simply would not tolerate a repetition of the horrors of Bosnia.</P>
    <P>There has been debate as to the legal basis for the action by NATO. The Government shares the view of a number of others that it is always preferable to have explicit Security Council authorisation for the use of force. In Berlin, I had a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of the other EU neutral states &ndash; Austria, Finland and Sweden &ndash; and it was evident that our views on this and other aspects of the Kosovo crisis were very close. Realistically, however, given the divisions among the permanent members of the Security Council, it was clear that it was most unlikely that any furthermore explicit decision would have been agreed. The Secretary General of the United Nations spoke for many when he said: &ldquo;It is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace&rdquo;. I agree with Kofi Annan.</P>
    <P>The European Council, meeting in Berlin last week, considered the developments in Kosovo as they unfolded. At the forefront of our concerns was the new humanitarian crisis emerging in Kosovo. Following the commencement of the air strikes, the Council concluded that the responsibility lay with President Milosevic, who was facing the severest consequences about which he had been repeatedly warned. The European Council also made it clear that the international community would not tolerate crimes against humanity. It stated:</P>
    <P>Those now persisting with the conflict in Kosovo should not forget that the mandate of the Hague tribunal covers Kosovo. They and their leaders will be held personally accountable for their actions.</P>
    <P>However, together with our EU partners, we have made it clear that our policy is not directed against the Yugoslav or Serb population or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is directed <Col N="1288" /> against the irresponsible Yugoslav leadership under President Milosevic.</P>
    <P>The latest developments also involve enormous risks, not only for the Kosovar population but for the stability of the region. There are dangers of escalation and of overspill. The Government is committed to working in international fora &ndash; the United Nations, the OSCE and the EU &ndash; to ensure that these risks are minimised and that the way is facilitated for a return to the political process which alone can provide an acceptable outcome for all concerned.</P>
    <P>We are also actively involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance. Since the crisis in Kosovo began, the Government has provided a total of £200,000 to the International Red Cross for Kosovar refugees in the region. This has included assistance in the form of clothing, food, shelter and health care for the most vulnerable. The Government is monitoring the situation closely and is in regular contact with the international agencies involved in the relief effort, notably the UNHCR which is the lead humanitarian agency in the region. A contribution of £400,000 was announced yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, to the UNHCR to allow it meet the needs of refugees fleeing from Kosovo.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland is contributing assistance through the European Community Humanitarian Office &ndash; ECHO &ndash; which has in the past few days approved further emergency aid to address the needs of both refugees and the local populations in neighbouring regions. The situation in Kosovo has now entered a new and highly dangerous phase. NATO air strikes are not an objective in themselves but are a means to an end. However, there was always the risk that they might prove counterproductive. I sincerely hope that this does not prove to be the case.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that prolonged hostilities, with mounting casualties on all sides, will contribute to peace and reconciliation in the Balkans. The focus of attention must now be to get back to the negotiating table and re-establish an international presence in Kosovo, acceptable to all. This can best be achieved under the auspices of either the United Nations or the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. We will continue to work to achieve the objectives on which there is broad international agreement.</P>
    <P>In this context, I welcome the initiative of Prime Minister Primakov, who is currently in Belgrade. I understand he will make contact with the German Presidency of the EU subsequent to his visit. The Government has been supporting the maintenance of close contacts between the EU and Russia on this issue, following the discussions which the Taoiseach had with Prime Minister Primakov in Shannon last Tuesday. I also understand from contacts in the EU that the Troika &ndash; Germany, Austria and Finland &ndash; is seeking a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No situation is black and white. It is clear &ndash; I hope the Minister would agree &ndash; that for more than a decade now one man, Slobodan Milosevic, has contributed to mayhem in the former Yugoslavia and in the Balkan region generally. Would the Minister agree that, notwithstanding good intentions on the part of all sorts of organisations, including the European Union, NATO is the only organisation capable of getting Mr. Milosevic's attention and that no other approach from any other organisation has ever been heeded by Mr. Milosevic or his cohort? </P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, and, so far as the Minister is aware, would others who are advocating an end to bombing agree, that should the bombing end ground troops should be sent in? Is it the Minister's or the Government's intention that Irish troops should be part of the ground troops being advocated, or are we again expecting that this will be looked after by some other organisation or some other state? </P>
      <P>In regard to the refugees, the Minister mentioned that a contribution of £400,000 was made yesterday. I welcome that and I hope the Minister will keep the situation under review. Will he confirm that Ireland will take its share of refugees from Kosovo if and when the situation arises and if this becomes a particular necessity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the last part of the Deputy's question first. The Deputy is asking whether the Government is prepared to accept Kosovar refugees in our country. The primary objective of international effort remains to search for a lasting settlement in Kosovo which would allow refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes. The resettlement of refugees in third countries would be a last resort. The refugees see it as a last resort, despite the enormous obscenity, tragedy and stress to which they have been subjected. It is critical that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees which is working in the region continues to be given support to carry out its mandate. The Government has to date given more than £600,000, and a tranche of £400,000 in recent days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, our position as outlined by the Taoiseach and others is, and remains, that the use of military force against another state other than in self-defence should be authorised by the United Nations Security Council. In the case of Kosovo the Security Council has agreed the objective, which is to protect the human rights of the Kosovo Albanians against the repressive actions of the Belgrade leadership. However, the permanent members of the Security Council have been split on the question of the action necessary to secure that objective. Within the Security Council, of the co-called permanent five &ndash; that is, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom and the United States &ndash; three have said that UN Resolutions 1199 and 1203, passed last September and October respectively, cover this air strike. On the <Col N="1290" /> other hand, the Chinese and the Russians say they do not.</P>
    <P>Deputies have called on me to go to the United Nations. I have no problems about any of those matters and I am not critical. Everybody is entitled to their opinion, including the newspapers. I must accept their right to hold opinions but I do not have to agree with them. I do not agree with the view expressed that I should go to the United Nations and raise the matter there. The UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has this situation under control and if the United Nations passed a resolution, it appears to me, in the current circumstances and condition of the permanent five, that we would get nowhere. Therefore, I respectfully suggest that to follow that advice would be an exercise in futility.</P>
    <P>The problem that has arisen, however, is that in the case of Kosovo, as the Deputy quite rightly points out, a State practising murder and other appalling human rights abuses against its own population is effectively immune from intervention unless explicitly authorised by the United Nations Security Council. I have no doubt that this dilemma will be a major challenge for the international community as we enter the new millennium.</P>
    <P>There are clearly some aspects of international law, particularly the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of states, which need to be viewed not as an absolute but in the context of ensuring respect for human rights and averting human catastrophes within states as an effective basis for concerted action by the international community. I would wish for consensus in the Security Council when faced with situations of human catastrophe. However, I am afraid that in this regard they have been found particularly wanting.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism, justified or otherwise, of my position on the matter. I will set out what I said in Berlin when I was interviewed for some ten minutes by a very pleasant young man on that programme. I have not seen a recording of the programme since but, as I understand it, I said our position was that we would prefer to have had a UN mandate, but in the meantime I asked whether the international community was supposed to stand by and see hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes? I concluded by saying that I would like to see the bombing stopped as soon as possible and the parties getting back to the talks.</P>
    <P>I saw a situation where one fifth of the Kosovar Albanian population has been put out of their homes by this terrible obscenity in Belgrade &ndash; the leadership of Yugoslavia. In one month, up to late in the evening of the Thursday before the bombing started, 65,000 people had been put out of their homes. Up to the previous Friday, 25,000 people had been put out of their homes. That is what I was remarking upon. We did not initiate, nor were we a party to, the decision to go in and strike Belgrade. We are not members of NATO and we will not be as long as this Government is <Col N="1291" /> in power. Due to our neutrality, we cannot be a party to military alliances. If there is to be a change in our neutrality we have to put that to the people by way of referendum and they will decide.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General of the United Nations said, &ldquo;It is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace&rdquo;. I said that in my substantive reply to the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>The Austrian Chancellor said that &ldquo;in view of the drastically sharpening situation there was effectively no other option than to stop the behaviour of the Yugoslav army and the Serbian paramilitary groupings by aerial attack. It is not a question of taking sides but rather forestalling a deterioration in the absolutely unbearable humanitarian catastrophe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Swedish Prime Minister said, &ldquo;From the point of view of international law it is difficult to find a clear and unequivocal basis for the military operations which are now taking place. NATO's decision to proceed with air strikes has clearly been taken with the aim of preventing a new humanitarian disaster and to re-establish peace in the region. I concur with the Swedish Prime Minister on that point.</P>
    <P>There has been some misleading information on the Austrian position as a neutral country. Mr. Wolfgang Schussel is the Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor. He is a conservative who wants to ditch Austrian neutrality, while the Chancellor, Mr. Victor Klima is a socialist who wants to retain Austrian neutrality. Interestingly, the Austrian constitution does not allow overflights in this or any other context.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will revisit my question about refugees. Will we or will we not accept refugees if that situation arises?</P>
      <P>Is it true that the NATO bombing has taken place because there is no other plan? If the bombing stops now, what proposals do the Minister and his EU colleagues have? Is there a plan B? If the bombing can be stopped, are there any other plans to try to bring Mr. Milosevic to account?</P>
      <P>What steps has the Minister personally taken to influence events in the former republic of Yugoslavia, particularly in Kosovo? Will he tell the House not what members of the Security Council are saying in relation to UN Resolution 1199 or 1203 or any other resolution, but whether in the opinion of the Irish Government this action is legal in international law? Far from Mr. Milosevic shaking in his boots at the prospect of being brought before an international crime tribunal, there are others in Bosnia such as Ratko Mladic who should be brought to justice. Why are people like that being allowed to run around?</P>
      <P>Following discussions here last week with the Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Yevgeny Primakov, is the Government aware of whether Mr. Primakov has some compromise proposals that might solve the problem if the bombing ends?</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Primakov had discussions with the Taoiseach on his way to the United States. I understand he left Shannon for the United States but when he was two hours from the US coast he turned back, for obvious reasons. I understand that up to the night the bombing began Mr. Primakov was talking to Mr. Milosevic, who still refused to listen to sense and to call off the dogs of war. I was there. I was on the point of doing a number of television and radio programmes when a man called Brunsen from one of the British broadcasting companies told me that he had this information. I accepted what he said because he belongs to a reputable profession. Mr. Primakov at this moment is talking to Mr. Milosevic and there is hope that, while he was not successful the first time, he may be successful now. As the Deputy quite properly says, the stakes are too high. War could spread with a ripple effect in the Balkans and the question of refugees and their overflow into neighbouring countries is of immediate concern. I have already indicated the Government's position in relation to Kosovar refugees coming to Ireland. The primary objective of international efforts remains the search for a lasting settlement in Kosovo so that refugees and displaced persons can return to their homes. That would be the first post-war objective of any settlement. The resettlement of refugees in third countries at this time would be a last resort. It is critical that the United Nations <Col N="1293" /> High Commission on Refugees which is working on the ground in the region continues to be given support to carry out its mandate. In this regard, the Government has given a contribution.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has asked if I am saying the Government will not offer to bring Kosovar refugees to Ireland and that is a fair question. I will not avoid it. I do not say we will not take in Kosovar refugees. I am saying that our clear preference, at this stage, is that a solution to the present crisis be found which would allow refugees to return to Kosovo to whatever has been left of their homes. Should the need arise, Ireland would naturally be prepared to play its part.</P>
      <P>Since the crisis began the European Union has given 9.06 billion ecu towards the relief effort through ECHO, the EU humanitarian agency. These funds were channeled through the various UN agencies and the NGOs operating in the region for the provision of food, health care and shelter. In response to the latest developments a further 2 million euro in emergency assistance has been allocated to the UNHCR, the International Federation of the Red Cross and NGOs to distribute emergency supplies of food and domestic items. Refugees, host families and the most vulnerable will benefit from this assistance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has asked about troop movements. Being the week it is, I do not intend to wash my hands of this matter, as has been suggested. However, we were not part of the organisation which carried out these air strikes. If and when a UN mandate is given and when the OSCE comes into play after the war, we will play our part as we have already done. Our Army and gardaí played a decent and honourable role, as always, in Bosnia. We were prepared to be part of the verification mission in Kosovo. That remains our position.</P>
      <P>We will continue to monitor the position with regard to humanitarian aid, taking account of our obligation in this enormous human catastrophe. As for decisions about army movements, we are not part of a military alliance. We would not be party to any decisions taken by NATO in that regard nor, as a result of our non-membership, would we be informed of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vienna European Council of 11 and 12 December last addressed the question of arrangements, under the Amsterdam Treaty, for ensuring the availability of an effective operational capability at the Union's disposal. The essential backdrop to this matter is Article 17 of the Amsterdam Treaty under which provision is made for the Union to avail itself of the Western European Union, &ldquo;to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union&rdquo; in the areas covered by the Petersberg Tasks &ndash; humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
      <P>The Vienna European Council invited the German Presidency to further the debate on how the European Union can best ensure effective responses to the kinds of crises that we have seen in the Balkans in recent years. The European Council will review matters at its meeting in Cologne in June on the basis of a progress report by the German presidency and is expected to encourage continuing consideration of these matters. Also of relevance will be developments in other fora of which Ireland is not a member, including the NATO summit in April which is expected to finalise arrangements whereby NATO supportive resources may be made available for Petersberg Tasks conducted at the instigation of the EU, and the Western European Union ministerial meeting at Bremen in May which Ireland will attend in an observer capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consistently made clear my view that the Amsterdam Treaty offers much potential for enhancing the operation of the Union's common foreign and security policy and I did so again at the recent informal ministerial meeting in Germany to which the Deputy has made reference in his question. The value of the Amsterdam Treaty is that it affords a role in peacekeeping and crisis management to all 15 EU members if they so wish. I underlined the importance of making effective use of the Amsterdam Treaty's mechanisms on the Petersberg Tasks and I was glad to see that there is a general view among EU partners that the EU's priority should be effective conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management. The German Presidency has made clear that the focus of EU efforts in the defence area should be the Petersberg Tasks, as distinct from issues of mutual defence commitments which are for NATO. This is in accordance with the provisions of the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treat<Col N="1295" /> ies relating to the specific character of the security and defence policies of certain member states.</P>
    <P>This debate will continue, I believe, well after Cologne. To date, no formal proposals have been put forward. The priority, in my view, should be to ensure that the Treaty of Amsterdam's crisis management provisions are fully implemented and tested. In the light of the requirements of the Petersberg Tasks, consideration can be given to any practical improvements within the European Union deemed necessary to support the more efficient and effective implementation of the Treaty's provisions.</P>
    <P>There is of course full acceptance within the EU that the views of all EU member states, including those of Ireland and the other neutral states, must be taken fully into account as the debate unfolds. However, the debate is at a very early stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What military structures do the Germans have in mind? Can the Minister tell the House if, for example, the incorporation of Petersberg Tasks-type commitments into the EU post-Maastricht would require military structures? Is the German proposal simply that Ministers for Defence should attend general affairs council meetings or do they have in mind the European Union becoming a sort of European NATO? </P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, following the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, for Ireland to join a European defence structure would require a referendum? This would be in keeping with Article N of the Maastricht Treaty and with the Amsterdam Treaty, which requires that any change in this area must come about after an intergovernmental conference and be ratified in accordance with the constitutional requirements of each state, which in Ireland calls for the holding of a referendum. However, if we were to join NATO, the Constitution would not require the holding of a referendum. Furthermore, under the Good Friday Agreement, we could do almost anything within these islands without holding a referendum. Is it not a fact that only joining a European Union defence community would require a referendum post the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The central purpose of the Amsterdam Treaty negotiated while the Deputy's party was in Government is to enhance the EU's capacity for peacekeeping and crisis management. The EU is not a military organisation and the Western European Union possesses negligible resources of its own. NATO possesses such resources and a key element as I made clear in this House before, is effective and mutual co-operation between institutions, such as the EU, the Western European Union and NATO, so the EU can act for peace and security in Europe through the Petersberg Tasks. This is crisis man<Col N="1296" /> agement and conflict resolution right across the board.</P>
      <P>At the informal EU summit in Poertschach last October, the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, raised the question of enhancing the effectiveness of the common foreign and security policy in the face of crises such as the Balkans, particularly, if and when, other countries do not wish to be fully engaged. These ideas were further aired at an Anglo-French summit at St. Malo in early December. At the Vienna European Council in December, it was agreed to continue to reflect on these issues. Central to these reflections is the imminent entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam under which the EU can use the Western European Union to undertake the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
      <P>I, like other neutral countries, want to see the effective implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty provisions on the Petersberg Tasks, which were the result of an initiative by Sweden and Finland and fully supported by Ireland. The ongoing debate as far as our position is concerned and that of the other neutral countries should proceed with respect for the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty and the specific positions &ndash; this is the important point &ndash; of the non-allied EU member states, including Ireland, should be taken into account. That is accepted by other EU member states and our position on neutrality is a principled one.</P>
      <P>As long as we remain neutral, we have an obligation to ensure our position is clear within the EU and as long as I am Minister for Foreign Affairs, I will continue to do that. That is why last Thursday I, and the other neutral countries, felt this statement &ndash; one statement was made before the bombing started and the shorter one after it &ndash; showed an unnecessary bias in a NATO context. That is why we wanted to make it more EU and neutral friendly. I am fully committed to Irish neutrality until there is a referendum and the people decide otherwise. I respectfully suggest that if there was a referendum on Irish neutrality tomorrow, it would hold the principle of continuing Irish neutrality.</P>

      <P>In the context of this reply and an earlier one on Kosovo, how does the Minister define Irish neutrality? Will he state as simply as possible how he defines it? Did he say we are not and will never be a member of NATO?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context, when the German Presidency says the military structures to be considered in its report relate to the Petersberg Tasks, that is, peacekeeping and rescue missions, and that mutual defence is a matter for NATO and if that is a correct reading of the German position, is the Minister satisfied that the mutual defence of members of the Europe Union should be left to NATO as distinct from the EU <Col N="1297" /> itself developing its own mutual defence arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on the development of the EU mutual defence arrangements is at a very early stage arising from the summits of Poertschach and St. Malo. It is interesting that when Mr. Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, came to report on the bilateral meeting between the French and the British at St. Malo it was reported as good news for the EU. My intervention was to the effect that it was not good news for me or for the other EU neutral countries. Being of a friendly disposition, Mr. Cook took my intervention as reasonable and accepted it.</P>
      <P>I can give the Deputy a first class definition of Irish neutrality from the opening address by the Taoiseach at a European Movement national conference on Partnership for Peace at the Burlington Hotel on 29 March 1998. Speaking about Partnership for Peace, he said neutrality in Ireland's case has been an important expression of sovereignty and membership of a military alliance means an automatic obligation to go to war if an ally is attacked. As Mr. de Valera put the case in 1955, a small nation has to be extremely cautious when it enters into alliances, that we would not be consulted on how war would be started and that the great powers would do that. He said that when it was ended, no matter who won, we would not be consulted as to the terms on which it would end. That experience properly applied even more to world wars than the limited conflicts with which we have to deal today over which some consultation does or may take place.</P>
      <P>Our position as a militarily neutral country is that the Dáil retains the ultimate decision on behalf of the people on a case by case basis without any obligation to have any military involvement. The Government may only commit Irish troops abroad with the approval of the Dáil following due deliberation. We do not propose to change that position. The Government has not a hidden policy agenda that would involve joining a military alliance and remains, along with all other parties, committed to consulting the people in a referendum should there be an agreed proposal involving any change in that.</P>
      <P>The heart of Ireland's foreign policy has always been support for international collective security and engagement in peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks. Now that existing defence organisations have moved in the direction of adopting these tasks as one of their main priorities, the Amsterdam tasks, the Amsterdam Treaty and Petersberg Tasks, it would be perverse of us to refuse to co-operate with them to the same end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interesting reply was given to a parliamentary question on 30 April 1997 restating the Government's commitment to a policy of military neutral. It says that in the Government's White Paper on foreign policy. There is a clear and unequivocal statement that the Government will <Col N="1298" /> not propose that Ireland should seek membership of the Western European Union of which we are observers, or NATO or assume their mutual defence guarantees. It says the White Paper also makes clear that the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy would be put to the people in a referendum and that this will ensure Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged unless the people decide otherwise. That was contained in a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Mr. Ray Burke, the then Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, to the then Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

      <P>Membership of PfP and other matters were set out in a fine paper produced by the former Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, and they were discussed in considerable depth. PfP was high on the former Minister's list and he was committed to joining it as a matter of some urgency. One can only ask why that was not done during the term of office of the then coalition.

      <P>We will come to PfP on the <Col N="1300" /> next question, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle. Patrick Smyth of <i>The Irish Times</i>, a reliable journalist, wrote on 5 March that other neutral countries were more enthusiastic than our Minister about the proposals. Why does he suggest that all neutral countries took the same view when some took a different view from his? A European defence community is on the horizon &ndash; I note with interest Deputy De Rossa's suggestions, which are worthy of consideration and debate &ndash; but after the Amsterdam Treaty we cannot enter into it without a referendum. That is written into the Constitution, and I challenge anyone to disagree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is putting an untruth on the record of the House. If the European defence community is on the horizon and if we are to meet the late Éamon de Valera's concerns about larger states leading us into alliances, does this not hinge on the commitment in Article 5 of the Western European Union? For example, if it could be negotiated into a protocol, which was the position taken by a number of EU member states during the reflection group process, small states like Ireland would be able to opt in or out of a European defence community on a case by case basis. Instead of always reacting to proposals put forward by others, could we not come up with proposals? If we did, in the medium term or long-term we would arrive at a position, not after being led by member states but as a result of a plan of our own, including the possibility of a protocol to future treaties, which would allow us to exercise options.

Is he aware a 1996 United States Defence Department document in essence states that, when it states the Partnership for Peace has evolved quickly from a bare concept to an active association of military and defence institutions which trade, exercise and work together with NATO countries? Is it not clear from that document that the movers of Partnership for Peace see it as a military alliance? Therefore, any entry into it by this State should be considered as entering military alliance.

      <P>Quite the contrary, it is anything but a military alliance. Currently 43 countries are involved in Partnership for Peace, 24 of which are non-members of NATO. Apart altogether from the neutrals, I include all our EU partners and the neutral States of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. The argument has been made that Switzerland has a strange form of neutrality and there are some doubts about its depth. Russia is a member of Partnership for Peace. That is extraordinary. The question of associate membership of NATO has arisen. Membership of NATO is completely different from involvement in Partnership for Peace. Some 24 members of NATO are participants in Partnership for Peace, including Russia and other European neutral states. I do not think anyone would claim Russia or Switzerland are associate members of NATO because of participation in Partnership of Peace. A treaty is not involved when joining partnership for peace.</P>

      <P>I have made the Government's position clear in this House. It is our intention that, in the light of the current debate and following the European elections, in which parties will no doubt take the opportunity to set out their approaches, Ireland will participate in Partnership for Peace in the second half of this year. A decision in favour of participation in Partnership for Peace would be submitted to this House for its approval and would make clear the nature and scope of our participation in Partnership for Peace.</P>
      <P>I have made clear previously, and I am happy to do so again, that participation in Partnership for Peace would not be in conflict with our neutrality. I do not believe a referendum on this matter is either required or appropriate as Partnership for Peace would not be in conflict with our neutrality and would not impose treaty obligations. This was the view of the previous Government. It is also the view of the Attorney General, whose advice on the matter I have recently sought and received.</P>

When we join Partnership for Peace we will, as other neutral States have done, appoint an ambassador to NATO and presumably follow the tradition of other neutral states and appoint our ambassador to the Western European Union as ambassador to NATO. Will the Minister consider, without further delay, appointing an ambassador to NATO, presumably our ambassador to the Western European Union, so that the concerns and views of this House can be communicated to the Secretary General of NATO in relation to, for example, the situation in Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate how he imagines that European Parliament elections are a basis for deciding national policy in relation to Partnership for Peace? The Partnership for Peace is an agency of NATO and not of the European Union. The Government has a specific mandate, which it sought and received during the last general election, not to join Partnership for Peace and if such a choice was made, a referendum would be held. How does the Minister see a European Parliament election overturning that mandate? Does he agree it is an extraordinary way to address a democratic issue of this nature?</P>
      <P>When was the Government decision to join Partnership for Peace made? How many of the booklets, which the Minister announced, will be published? Who will draft the document? Will the person be independent of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government? Will the views for and against be presented in the booklet? Will the booklet be free and how will it be distributed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will be an independent input to ensure transparency, openness and accountability. I subscribe to the Deputy's suggestion in that regard. I also hope that the booklet will, as the Taoiseach announced yesterday, present a balanced argument. It should outline the cases for and against in a balanced way. This is a reasonable proposal and I will pursue it. However, whether the outcome of my efforts will subscribe to what the Deputy seeks is another question.</P>
      <P>Regarding the cost, etc., I hope the pamphlet will be free. As the Deputy is aware, people do not pursue matters where there is no charge. However, in terms of the need to inform, I expect that the booklet will be free. I will take on board the Deputy's reasonable points and suggestions for which I thank him.</P>
      <P>In relation to the mandate, our position on Partnership for Peace was well known at the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to avoid the issue. It was clearly stated in our election literature that we would not be party to Partnership for Peace. However, in the meantime, we have considered the position and we now see, having regard to what is required of Ireland in the EU and elsewhere, that it is important Ireland takes up membership of Partnership for Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked when the decision to join Partnership for Peace was made. If the Deputy reads a number of statements made by the Taoiseach before and after Christmas, he will note <Col N="1307" /> that the issue was finally resolved around that time and it was agreed to open a debate on it.</P>
    <P>In relation to when a decision was made by the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, I opened the debate on the subject some weeks ago. Those present voted unanimously for Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace. I must now appear before the national executive of my party and propose that Ireland joins Partnership for Peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the co-operation between neighbours Norway, which is aligned, and Sweden, which is non-aligned, does the Minister see opportunities North and South and east and west to build on the existing co-operation between the Air Corps and the RAF regarding search and rescue missions under Partnership for Peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Deputy raised this issue. As a former Minister for Defence and the Marine, I am aware of the involvement of the RAF in air and sea rescue operations. We have at all times expressed our gratitude to the RAF. In relation to the Air Corps and the small number of helicopters at its disposal, the biggest of its helicopters has been used on a number of occasions at the request of the British authorities in the most adverse conditions by a brave group of young pilots. It cuts both ways.</P>
      <P>I am not sure of the possible position in terms of participation in Partnership for Peace. I am not an expert in this matter or many others. However, if it was possible to formalise the arrangement in that context, there is no reason not to do so. In the meantime co-operation continues between the British and Irish authorities in a meaningful and genuine way regarding sea and air rescue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Although he denied it earlier, will the Minister admit that his party has done a complete U-turn on this issue? In his party's election manifesto, it was stated unequivocally that Fianna Fáil would have nothing to do with NATO or NATO led organisations. Does the Minister agree that his party has taken the electorate for a ride? Will he explain how the European elections will be a referendum or a barometer of public opinion in relation to Partnership for Peace? Given that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour support participation in Partnership for Peace, how will the Minister judge that? If Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour each win a seat and the Green Party wins one seat, does that mean that the Irish people favour participation in Partnership for Peace? Does the Minister accept that argument is absurd?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> Can the Minister explain why we cannot have an indicative referendum? Irish neutrality is not enshrined in the Constitution. The best way, therefore, to carry this out would be through a referendum commission such as the one which gave us an independent booklet on issues such as the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 19, to delete &ldquo;p.l.c.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> Section 10(1) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 states:</P>
    <P>The names of the companies shall be, respectively .</P>
    <P>(b) Bord Telecom Éireann or, in the English language, The Irish Telecommunications Board.</P>
    <P>Section 10(2) states:</P>
    <P>Each company shall be exempt from the requirement of section 6(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1963, to include the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; or &ldquo;teoranta&rdquo; in its title.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter on Committee Stage. There is a question about whether Telecom Éireann is at present legally entitled to call itself a plc. The name of the company is set out in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act as Bord Telecom Éireann, not Bord Telecom Éireann plc. The company was allowed to issue shares under sections 8 and 9 of the 1996 Act but nowhere did the Act permit the company to change its name to a plc. If it had done so, my advice is it would be legally dubious.</P>
    <P>Even if the company is a plc, there is a question as to whether the term &ldquo;plc&rdquo; is part of its name because of section 10(2) of the 1983 Act. This is being repealed in the Second Schedule but until that comes into force, Bord Telecom Éireann is the factual name of the company.</P>

      <P>&mdash;in line 24, section 2: &ldquo;&lsquo;network operator' means Bord Telecom Éireann&rdquo;, not Bord Telecom Éireann plc. This is a technical point but I am concerned that it could lead to difficulties. After Committee Stage, I again took legal advice on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made clear efforts on this matter and have been in contact with the Deputy's office and his legal adviser. We also consulted our legal advisers and sought the advice of the parliamentary draftsman. Their advice is that it is correct to use the name Bord Telecom Éireann plc.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 was to permit the sale of shares in the company and to facilitate a situation of multiple shareholders. Implicit in this is the fact that the company would be re-registered as a public limited company. The company was, therefore, re-registered as a public limited company on 20 December 1996. Once a company has been so registered, it is obliged to use the term under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the term &ldquo;plc&rdquo; is to serve as a signal to anybody dealing with that company that its liability is limited. Where this is the case, it is <Col N="1321" /> important that it should be clearly stated. The word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; means a private limited company, which Bord Telecom Éireann was in 1983. In December 1996, the company became a public company. When it became a public limited company, the exemption from using the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; no longer applied. That is the advice I received from my advisers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, it could not pre-empt the work of the Oireachtas so it could not presume to state what the company was until this legislation is passed. The Deputy received different advice from mine and that is where the matter rests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have acknowledged earlier that the Minister had been in contact with me about this matter. I went over the implications of the 1996 Act with the legal adviser who says something may or may not be implicit in the Act. However, the 1983 Act was not changed. I will not press this amendment, but we are concerned that the legislation should be drafted as well as possible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;Section 8(2) of the Act of 1996 is hereby amended by the insertion after paragraph (a) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(aa)The Minister may not dispose of any shares in the company other than as provided for in subsection (3)(a) without the terms of such sale being laid before and approved by Dáil Éireann.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage. The Government can also claim ownership of this amendment because it was originally submitted by Deputy Séamus Brennan. In the context of overall accountability, and because of recent events which have not been helpful in terms of this legislation, referral back to this House in respect of the disposal of State assets should be adhered to on all occasions. I therefore ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Shea's amendment because there are very important issues of accountability in question. This amendment proposes that we in this House should have an opportunity to discuss the terms of the sale as it proceeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few examples illustrate why this is of vital importance. I was aghast to read some of the Sunday papers on a matter that relates not to me or to politics but to good corporate governance. Informed sources spoke about the vice-chairperson who had resigned from Telecom Éireann, having sought an executive job and having been turned down, how he had been objected to by the <Col N="1322" /> other shareholders on the board, and had a bad relationship with the chief executive. This all came from spin doctors somewhere in the Department, somewhere on the official side. The Minister herself said last week in the Dáil in relation to the man in question that he had served Telecom Éireann well as a director and as chairman and that she wished to thank him for his contribution. If that was the official position, I resent deeply that some anonymous sources went on to do a malicious hatchet job on his reputation by making these suggestions about the KPN-Telia objection. That is an example of spin doctors who are not accountable to anyone. I would go so far as to say that some of the Minister's predecessors of my own political party were not well served by these same spin doctors. I do not like to see someone who has given six years on the board of Telecom Éireann being treated in this way and his reputation damaged. That is one example of why these matters should be brought back before the Dáil. It is reprehensible that a person who is not in a position to defend himself should be subjected to these allegations and have his reputation damaged.</P>
    <P>The second example relates to two key concerns workers have about this Bill. I was not aware of these concerns. Perhaps the Minister would clarify why there is a need for ongoing accountability as referred to in amendment No. 2. Not everybody in the employment of Telecom Éireann availed of the opportunity to buy shares. I understand that about 200 workers did not sign up. They are now being told the Partnership 2000 pay rise will not be granted. They are saying they were not given this information at the time. It is one thing not to opt into the shares but to be denied a pay rise is an entirely separate matter. Here they have come to a Dáil representative and, as this amendment sets out, it is an opportunity for the Minister to give an answer and also later on, if there are similar questions as we come near the final sale.</P>
    <P>The final question I have relates to the fact that some workers were under the impression that under section 5 of the 1983 Telecommunications Act they could revert to their Civil Service status. This issue only arose in the context of privatisation when a few applications were lodged and they have in recent days been refused, at the point of privatisation. This is an important issue for future privatisation schemes and for the status of employees. In terms of accountability in this Dáil I understand it is the Minister who makes the decision as to whether they can be readmitted to the Civil Service. Why have they been refused, and why was it not made explicit? How were they under a misapprehension, because they were of the opinion that they could revert to Civil Service status if they so desired?</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to condemn the spin doctors for what they did in the Sunday papers to the former vice-chairperson of the Telecom Éireann board. It was poor thanks to have his reputation damaged by those remarks. It serves <Col N="1323" /> no-one well that this should be done. He is not a politician. I have not spoken to this man. Nor have I ever spoken about this issue. I just think it is wrong that a former chairperson should be treated in this way by anonymous spin doctors. I invite the Minister also to answer the two specific queries from workers. Is it true that a Partnership 2000 pay rise is being denied to some 200 people who did not sign up for shares, and can people revert to the Civil Service under section 45 as they expected to be able to do?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for putting down the amendment and Deputy Yates for his contribution. I did not read a Sunday paper until Monday morning, and there were reasons for that. I did not know what was in them, so there is no point in my talking about it. I spoke to nobody about it. I am precluded, because of the sensitive nature of all of these matters from saying anything, but I intend, in time to write about it very fully when all the matters have been dealt with. The Taoiseach has forbidden us to write, to keep diaries, but I will keep a diary of Telecom Éireann and, when it is all satisfactorily over, I will write my own tale about it.</P>
      <P>I repeat what I said last week. I was disappointed that the vice-chairman resigned. I repeat that the Government and the country thank him for his work with regard to Telecom Éireann. I have no other comment, nor do I make any comment, and I shall not until everything has been dealt with.</P>
      <P>On the other matter, I did not inquire how many people did not wish to participate in the ESOP. It would be essentially their own business if they did not want to. One of the terms of the employee share option scheme was that employees would give up their pensions and forego wage increments already announced. That surely evokes a question about the dreadful spin-doctoring about the great bargain the Telecom workers got. The Telecom workers paid for their shares. They took the loan of money and they have to pay it back. It will be five years before they get anything from the trust, from the 5 per cent, and it will be ten years before they will have paid anything back on the £90 million. I say that because there was a deliberate effort to besmirch that arrangement. The Deputy has told me that 200 people did not avail of ESOP.</P>

      <P>Yes. I do not know, given the collectivity of arrangements such as those, whether the majority holds sway. It was 200 out of 10,000. The Communication Workers Union and the other union involved decided this, and the terms had to be worked out. I will get the information for the Deputy.</P>

      <Col N="1324" /> The Deputy also asked a question relating to the Civil Service. Under the 1983 legislation such officials cannot go back to being called civil servants, but they have all the rights of civil servants. Apparently, the Bill made that clear in 1983. I do not remember the Bill, although I was a Member of the House.</P>
    <P>To return to Deputy O'Shea's amendment, I said on Committee Stage that I would be prepared to come back to the House on that matter. If the Deputy wishes to insert that amendment into the Bill I will agree.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;Section 10 of the Act of 1996 is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (1) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1A) In the event of the sale or transfer of shares in the company, the proportion of employee directors in relation to the total number of directors on the Board shall remain fixed at not less than the proportion of employee directors at the date of passing of this Act.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 were tabled by Deputy Séamus Brennan to the 1996 Bill when he was Opposition spokesperson. Amendment No. 4 states: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), the number of employee directors shall not be reduced below 4&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> The 1983 legislation includes the provision that the number of employee directors shall not exceed one third of the number that the Minister is otherwise entitled to appoint. The Minister was about to initiate talks with Congress on the position of worker directors in the new company. The amendments are clear in their intent and I await the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 6, in my name, is in this grouping. On Committee Stage I asked whether, if the State's holding goes from 50.1 per cent down to 15 per cent or whatever, it will retain any worker director. My amendment proposes that one such director would be retained with the diminished shareholding. This is a similar point to Deputy O'Shea's, which relates to proportionate board representation.</P>
      <P>I recall that the Minister was supportive of the principle. She said she was meeting the ICTU delegation two days after the debate on Committee Stage. We withdrew the amendments on the basis that the Minister wanted to have an overall approach that would not only suffice for Telecom Éireann but also for other State companies, as this is likely to be repeated in future. I look forward to the Minister having another legal formula that will allow some worker director retention. It is important to the unions who have been in contact with us about this matter. I know the Minister is supportive of the principle so I hope we can find some legal device for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for pursuing this matter. On Committee Stage I read the correspondence between Mr. Peter Cassells and myself, and Mr. Dermot McCarthy, the Assistant Secretary in the Taoiseach's office, who was in touch with Mr. Cassells. I understand that they had two meetings; one shortly after our discussions on Committee Stage and the other this morning. As of yet, they have not hit upon a formula.</P>
      <P>As we discussed on Committee Stage, the Bill as published provides for the removal of Telecom Éireann from the scope of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts. It would never be appropriate now because it is no longer a State enterprise.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy said, the issue of worker participation on the board is not just specific to Telecom Éireann, but is one that applies generally. Discussions are taking place because clearly what will apply to one semi-State company will have general applicability across a range of companies if and when their time comes to have partners, first of all, and then to be publicly floated. They have not yet come up with a formula of words, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know Deputy Séamus Brennan tabled the amendments, as the Deputy said, but at that stage there was only 20 per cent involving KPN/Telia with a possibility of a further 15 per cent and a subsequent clawback. The 20 per cent figure represented a reduction of the State's holding in <Col N="1326" /> Telecom Éireann, but it was still a State company. When Deputy Brennan put forward those amendments it was still a semi-State company but in this case it will no longer be one.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a representative for ESOP on the board, but that is a specific task. There should be a person on the board who would have a name for being in concert with the views and ideals of workers. Perhaps that is the formula we will come up with, although I do not know.</P>
    <P>To answer the Deputy directly, the talks between Mr. Cassells of ICTU and Mr. McCarthy, who is representing Partnership 2000, have not concluded. Therefore, I am not able to accept the amendment but it is my wish that there would be a person with a clear reputation for being in concert with workers' desires on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 10 to 13, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;(1) A reference to the company or to Bord Telecom Éireann, as the case may be, in section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act, 1951, sections 52(2), 96(d), 98, 99 and 110 of the Act of 1983, section 7 of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988, and in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993 shall be construed as a reference to &lsquo;a licensed operator'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Section 110 of the Act of 1983 shall, in respect of the company and a licensed oper<Col N="1327" /> ator, apply only for the purposes of section 98 of the Act of 1983 and the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>(3) In this section &lsquo;licensed operator' means the company or any person licensed under subsection (2) or (3) of section 111 of the Act of 1983.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I accepted the need to extend the relevant interception provisions to all telecommunications operators. That was in the light of Deputy Yates's amendment. At that time I said we would consider the draftsman's opinion and that there would be further consultation. I then brought this to Cabinet as it was a substantial change, and a good one.</P>
    <P>Other provisions covered only Telecom Éireann, and I did not see why they should not cover all licensed operators. The relevant provisions are sections 98 and 110 of the 1983 Act and the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993. The proposed amendment also extends five other provisions to all other licensed telecommunications operators. For example, the proposal ensures that certain offences in relation to telecommunications fraud and to making offensive calls are extended to cover those using the networks of other operators. That was more or less what Deputy Yates's amendment suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her speedy and detailed response in the short time between Committee and Report Stages. I am happy to withdraw my amendment, as it was somewhat blunt in its approach. The principle was that ESAT and other bodies would be put on the same footing as the Revenue Commissioners, the CAB, the Garda or other bodies who needed to tap telephones for the public good, and now that legal grey area has been removed. I am happy to accept the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that, like me, the Minister has come across the problem of people being upset by obscene telephone calls. My number is not ex-directory, and twice or three times a year I get a call at 3 a.m. from someone who rants drunkenly and anonymously at me. My telephone is beside my bed and I can replace the receiver without too much bother. However, obscene calls are particularly upsetting for women. People breathe heavily, do not speak and do other terrifying things. The telephone cannot be taken off the hook as the person may live alone and need to be in touch with family members. Are there adequate laws to deal with this and are there facilities to trace such calls? Elderly people in rural areas experience much turmoil and distress from such calls. They are terrorised in their own homes and that is outrageous and unacceptable. Will all telephone companies be obliged to put a tracing facility in place whereby this matter can be dealt with? We are told that anything can be done with tech<Col N="1328" /> nology. These people are often on the telephone to their victims for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that such obscene calls are appalling. I am sure that every Member has received such a call at one time or another &ndash; I recall such an incident in my own life. These calls come late at night when a person is vulnerable. Like most Deputies, my telephone number is not ex-directory, but I often take the telephone off the hook if it is late at night, if I am on my own and if I figure something may happen. There was a great fuss about this some years ago, and there is now an automatic number indication facility to identify who is calling. The Garda assures me it has powers to trace calls immediately.</P>
      <P>When we were drafting this amendment I told somebody about it and the person related an incident where a woman was called persistently at night by a person making lewd suggestions. The Garda drove to the telephone kiosk and knocked on its door as the person was in the middle of a call, so he was caught immediately. My advisers inform me that such calls are immediately traceable. The facility is automatic number identification.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 15 to 17, to delete &ldquo;shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall be borne by the company&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment states that the cost should be borne by the company and not the Oireachtas. If I had a perch on Committee Stage I would have fallen off it when the Minister stated that the potential cost to Merrill Lynch and AIB has been advised to you as being up to £40 million. It may not be £40 million, but the space tends to be filled if possible. Regarding the chairmanship, is the Minister satisfied she is getting value for money from these individuals? If we take her original surge of activity in January regarding the board at the behest of these advisers we can see how that led to a couple of casualties? Is she satisfied that these people are giving the best advice? Can anything be done to tie down the amount of money? Has a bonus system been put in place so that if the company yields £4.5 billion the advisers will be paid a certain sum and if it yields £5.5 billion they will be paid more? Do the terms include an incentive or a speculative element and what are the terms because £40 million is a great deal of money? Will the situation resemble that of Moneypoint and Mr. Gogarty, with the price being talked up afterwards regarding the price variation clause? If the variation can go as high <Col N="1329" /> as £40 million there is a great deal of scope for creative accounting. Is there an incentive or proportionate element? When I asked the Minister if there was a retail commission she said that was not the case.</P>
    <P>When we commenced the debate about the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, NCB and other equity brokers reported that Telecom was worth £3 billion. When the story about the ESOPs was published in the <i>Sunday Business Post </i>we were told the company was worth £5.5 billion. What is the best estimate of the worth of the company according to the Minister's advisers? There is a great difference between £3 billion and £5.5 billion. I accept that the company has increased in value but I was taken aback by this rise.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember our discussion about pension contributions. There will be quite a windfall to the Government if the figure of £5.5 billion is correct. All my trains, buses and planes will be repaired in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have been mine. These are very significant resources for public investment and represent a significant opportunity to deal with the infrastructure deficit. If the sum is £40 million it is not acceptable that the Exchequer should bear the total cost. The company should bear some of it. What are the Minister's advisers' best estimate of what the company would yield if it were sold tomorrow? How is the £40 million tied down? Is it, in fact, £4 million and only £40 million in theory? How will the sum be tied down to ensure that we get value for money? We must ensure that this sale does not become a windfall for advisers. The taxpayers and the subscribers who have invested in Telecom Éireann and who stayed with the company through thick and thin should receive the principal benefits of the share sale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>All officials in my Department will testify to the fact that I am extremely detached, if not sceptical, about advisers although I am told that my scepticism is ill-founded and that they are necessary for an exercise such as this. The amount was published in the Estimates last November. It is up to £40 million and the figure will depend on the success of the matter. I too am keen to ascertain a more precise figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation does not cover only Merrill-Lynch and AIB Capital Markets. It also covers several other advisory groups which appear to be contingent upon and working congruently with Merrill-Lynch on the matter. When I come to the House with the share statement, there will be a more profuse and precise description of the amount that would be paid. That will depend on the proportion of shares we float. That decision has not yet been taken by the Cabinet and, clearly, the amount to be paid will be dependent on that. Deputy Yates asked my own opinion. I <Col N="1330" /> have been cautioned against giving my opinion. Bewildering and wide-ranging figures are being quoted. The figure will depend on the market. At present, shares in Telecom Éireann are hot property but one does not know how long they will remain so. For this reason the flotation will take place at the end of June, depending on the market situation at that time. I have ideas of my own but common sense tells me to keep them to myself. We are about to file the prospectus for Telecom Éireann shares so it would not be appropriate for me to speculate about the figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the figure nearer £5.5 billion or £3 billion? There is a very great gap between those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is indeed a great gap. One can only pick one's analyst and take one's chances. Every analyst has a different view on what the final figure will be. Sometimes when I read the newspapers I wonder about it all. I suppose that is rural scepticism asserting itself although I have been told in polite language that my caution about advisers is not suitable in a sophisticated world. When I come to the House with my statement I will attempt to give more precise details about advisers and their costings.</P>

      <P>This issue was discussed on Committee Stage and I am particularly concerned about the question of redress for customers. The Ombusdman's report for 1998 on Telecom Éireann lists 106 valid complaints brought forward from 1997, 227 valid complaints received in 1998 amounting to a total on hand for 1998 of 333. Clearly, quite a few customers of Telecom Éireann have valid complaints against the company. There is nothing to prevent the Minister bringing in a short Bill to provide a form of redress for customers of a private company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>I am taking into account the global company and its activities &ndash; anything operated under the auspices of Bord Telecom Éireann plc.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was debated on Committee Stage. I understood legislation was being prepared for Etain Doyle and that a component of it would be that she would be able to provide the consumer service previously provided by the Ombudsman. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Shea and ask the Minister to perhaps firm up on the commitment as regards the new legislation so that there would be a proper statutorily based consumer division in Etain Doyle's office and that the powers of the Ombudsman could be maintained not only for Telecom Éireann, but for all telecom operators .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we would look at what was going on in the ODTR and at a type of consumer unit within it. Last week new regulations were signed which will, among other things, contain a number of consumer oriented provisions for all companies. Those regulations, implementing the EU directive on voice telephony and universal service, will include requirements on telecom operators to put in place procedures for the resolution of disputes with them. Where a dispute remains unresolved, the regulations will provide that consumers may use the small claims court for minor complaints against operators. The limit in the small claims court has gone up from £500 to £1,000, although I stand to be corrected on that. For larger complaints, the matter may be referred to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation.</P>
      <P>The regulations also impose restrictions on operators as regards withdrawing services for non-payment of bills. In the past State companies have always had a paternalistic approach to hardship cases and one could make a case to them. I am not referring to telephone bills but ESB and other bills. The regulations impose restrictions on operators as regards withdrawing services for non-payment of bills.</P>
      <P>Another development is that the director of the ODTR has recently issued a consultation document on her proposals for the handling by operators of disputes with customers and other operators. She has asked people to come back to her with ideas on her consultation document from which she will formulate proposals which will come to me for policy making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecom Éireann comes under the Ombudsman, prompt payments and other legislation but when it becomes largely privately owned, it will not have obligations under those Acts. Up to now the regulator would have been the relevant Minister and the Oireachtas but now the regulator will be someone who will be amenable to the Oireachtas and to the Comptroller and Auditor General. The regulations were signed last week <Col N="1332" /> and have been sent to the director. The import of those regulations will be that all companies will have to have procedures to deal with complaints from customers and the non-payment of bills, and the director has now issued a consultation document.</P>
    <P>The ideas promulgated in the Deputy's amendment are in hand but have not yet come to fruition. They will come to fruition only after discussions with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation who will formulate proposals which will go to the relevant Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined progress on this issue. I am concerned about redress being sought through the courts. The main feature of the Ombudsman service is that it is free and one makes a complaint which is processed through to a decision. What is proposed here weakens, to some extent, the position of the complainant. It will cost money to go to the small claims court. Going to court is an intimidating experience for many people, although we are talking about the small claims court here. If there was a vehicle which would replicate what the Ombudsman has provided until now, not only would it be the best solution but, in terms of equity, it is the one which is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy ever attend a small claims court? I did some years ago when I was responsible for labour affairs and we were drafting the Consumer Credit Bill. I wanted to see the court in operation because it came in under consumer legislation. We sat in a room like a very small office. The judge was dressed in a suit without anything on his head and the claimant, who was not represented by a solicitor, said she had bought an item in a store &ndash; I will not name it except to say it is up for sale and there is a proposed management buyout. The claimant felt she had got bad value and had been done. She expressed delight at seeing me there because she thought I could help her. I was there to listen and I sat at the back. The claimant showed the judge the receipts and he made a judgment. The difficulty is in enforcing the judgment because firms do not pay up, although they have smartened up in that regard.</P>
      <P>The small claims court is not a court, although that is what it is called. The claimant in the case I referred to had bought a sofa and produced photographs of it at the time of purchase and after three months. The small claims court is not intimidating and there is one in Sligo, Cork, Galway and I believe there will be one in Athlone. It is very popular.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&ndash;The company established under this Act shall be called Bord Telecom Éireann p.l.c.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since we passed the 1983 Act and moved from the Department of Post and Telegraphs to Bord Telecom Éireann, there has been enormous investment in its logo and name. It is abbreviated to BTE or TE and we cannot watch the weather forecast without seeing the light blue, the logo, the nice residences and how lovely Telecom Éireann is. We are now told after decades of investment in a logo and a name that it will be thrown out the window when there are new licensed operators. What will the initials be? Instead of BTE or TE, as it is known by people who do business with it, it will be called E or Eircom. It sounds like a walkie talkie company and is totally at variance with what has been a household name and operated as a monopoly.</P>
      <P>I am all for inventing &ndash; AIB spent a fortune on its Noah's ark &ndash; and twiddling with the logo but &ldquo;Eircom&rdquo; will cause confusion. It will have to be explained to investors and all the money spent promoting BTE will go down the drain. We are told it will cost £5 million to change everything from the head office in St. Stephen's Green, the letter heading and call cards to call boxes. All the livery will be changed. It is needless expense. There was no consultation with the biggest shareholder and this issue was decided at a board meeting in November. The Dáil needs to show common sense in the matter and the amendment is worthy of support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage. The board, at its meeting in perhaps November, made the decision and I was not informed until 17 or 18 December when, in the course of a meeting about another matter, it slipped into the conversation. This surprised me. I was then told about focus groups around the country &ndash; I have a deep suspicion of such groups &ndash; who suggested the name Eircom but I cannot get to the bottom of it. I was told that people dealing on the Manhattan stock exchange might think Telecom Éireann was Telecom Iran. I do not know if Iran is a bad word or a country where one might not want to purchase shares. Deputy <Col N="1334" /> Yates, and others complained, as I did, in my modest way, with the result that Telecom did not change its name for the flotation. Irrespective of whether one had good or bad experiences with Telecom Éireann, its name was instantly recognisable. The name on the livery, vans, etc. was to be changed to Eircom. In the course of a discussion about the issue in the Department I asked if those buying shares in Eircom would be asked to remember that it was really Telecom. That was when the penny dropped; they realised they would have to sell two names. A massive campaign will have to be embarked on to sell the name &ldquo;Eircom&rdquo;. When the flotation is over I will not have any control over this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>12. In page 6, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&ndash;in the sale of shares to be sold by the State arising out of this Act, the Minister may include within the retail offer of shares, a discount scheme, so that there will be a price tier, relative to shares sold to financial institutions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly about amendments Nos. 12 and 13 and that is why I retabled them. The amendment proposes that discount or free shares be given to subscribers and that bonus shares be given to those who show loyalty by not making a quick buck on selling the shares but retain them for three years. This would give investor equity stability in the company and allow it to reinvest for competitive acquisitions, growth, joint ventures, development in multimedia or whatever it <Col N="1335" /> decides to go into. The Minister's response was that she was keeping her cards relatively close to her chest because she wanted to bring a memorandum to Cabinet and discuss it with the parliamentary party, Deputy Roche and others.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the House to assert public policy and in this case Joe Public is entitled to free shares. This has been successful in a number of privatisations. In a reply to a question I tabled to the Minister I was told there would not be any free shares. The experience of the entire British privatisation process across a range of different utilities and commercial State companies was that the more the public was involved the less likely there were to be fat cats who had subsequently to be subject to a windfall tax. I saw an esteemed colleague and friend of the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on Friday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not resist it.  As Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he invested hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' and not pet food company money in the late seventies. Here is an opportunity for the taxpayer to get a pay back on the investment.  People had to wait for months to get a telephone and had nowhere to complain about disputed billing and so on. The workers have had their reward, and rightly so, for their loyalty and service to the company through the pension fund and ESOP. There could be an investor in Manhattan or New York, and the Minister was there rubbing shoulders with the good and great at that stock exchange recently &ndash; another good photo opportunity for her.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows these city slickers will be ready to pounce. If the shares are listed at £1.50 and make £2.00 overnight Joe Public will be forgotten. Presumably the legislation will be passed before Easter and the Minister will be clear as regards the legal basis for action. We were told last week that the draft prospectus was almost ready. Will the prospectus be issued before or after the memorandum to Government? The taxpayers have stayed with this company and invested heavily in it, and now is the time for their windfall. They are entitled to discount shares. The only remaining issue is a regulatory one, that is, will Eircom buy loyalty? That would be unfair to other companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My original thought was that each line subscriber should get 100 discounted or free shares. This would create a demand in that city slickers in Manhattan would have to chase the public to buy shares, driving the price upwards. That would be the best way to maximise the price of the company and the return, and it would allow the Irish public to obtain the benefits. Who is to say that members of the Cabinet might not think this a <Col N="1336" /> daft idea? I am not getting a guarantee that this will happen.</P>
    <P>Some people, such as Deputy Joe Higgins, are opposed to all privatisations but I take a pragmatic, non-ideological approach. It is important that we do not make the same mistakes as were made in the UK, where privatisations got a bad name because they generated private greed rather than public good and shared gain. These are crucial issues and this idea is sensible from the commercial perspective of a broker or analyst, seeking to maximise yield. The public is not represented by ICTU, only by this House, and it has rights. There should be a price tier for these people, and perhaps a ceiling of 200 shares &ndash; it is not a question of allowing them to take everything. There will be a gain between the quoted price and the subsequent trading price. This happened with the IPBS and First Active &ndash; people said the share price was ridiculously high but when the shares were traded they moved upward, and those who got the option at the listed price gained. The same will happen here, because we do not want a disaster like GPA, where the price was set too high and the shares could not be sold. There will be a gain for whoever gets the shares and the public should benefit &ndash; the profit should not be made by someone in Manhattan while the long-suffering public gets nothing.</P>

      <P>I read an article today which suggested the split should be 60-40 but I want a 50-50 split. That has not yet gone to Cabinet, I am stating a personal view, but our parliamentary party meeting took the strong view that the public should have a good chance of purchasing shares. I hope there will be an equitable distribution between purchasing citizens and the institutional purchasers, which we shall also need. We anticipate that the Cabinet decision on the size and breakdown of the offer will be made in May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being drafted at present. The best thing to do would be to give an outline timetable for these events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy about the UK but I think what went wrong was, first, they were strongly driven by ideology and there was wholesale privatisation. Second, workers or employees were never mentioned, the only idea was to sell everything straight away. There may have been an arrangement for employees but not much was said about it. Third, the outcome of those privatisations was a worse service for the consumer. A law had to be introduced to curb directors' and chief executives' fees, they were earning up to £500,000 per year. I am not jealous about what <Col N="1337" /> anyone is paid but they went about it in a daft way.</P>
    <P>Ireland is much smaller and we will not have that kind of nonsense. At the same time, the Deputy is right to issue a warning. When I bring this to Cabinet we will decide the breakdown, the overall size of the offer, the price, and incentives such as discounts or loyalty bonuses which would be offered to retail investors, that is, individual purchasers of shares. We will then examine what happens in other countries and international markets. It is normal practice to offer incentives to retail investors but it is early in the process to determine what these might be or to make commitments in that regard. We will be going back in May. I do not think anyone would quarrel with Deputy Yates' premise that citizens should have every right to purchase shares, if they so wish, and that they should be able to purchase a large proportion of shares. We need institutional and financial investors to provide large blocks of money but there should be equity. That is what I have decided but what advisers will say and what the Cabinet will decide are other matters. I am conscious that the advisers, without making derogatory remarks, will be from the institutions, that is the milieu in which they operate.</P>

The registration forms, on which one registers interest in buying shares, will be available in post offices. I do not know whether they will be in credit unions. It pays to have common sense.

      <P>The Attorney General has concerns that the proposal to include a provision in the Act as proposed by Deputy O'Shea for bringing the details before the Dáil for approval raises practical issues in terms of the motion to be put before the Dáil and it also raises possible issues of commercial sensitivity.

      <P>In page 6, line 10, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, but not later than the flotation date for the I.P.O.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is often a slippage in time plans for the flotation date. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure this Bill, when enacted, is implemented not later than the flotation date. This makes common sense and would be the correct way to proceed. The Minister gave an assurance on Committee Stage that this was the intention and that the flotation date would be the implementation date. There was an issue about some sections dealing with property. I am fascinated about who is watching on the monitor in so far as my remarks on accountability are concerned. I did not allege that the Minister said this should be raised in the Sunday newspapers, but it did occur. It was not that the man was a supporter of mine, but as one who had given good public service he was badly treated.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister please let us know the date of flotation? She has given an outline and mentioned that the draft prospectus should be ready in the next couple of weeks. This will be followed by a Government decision on the details of the sale, whether 35 per cent or whatever, and we will then proceed to execute the sale. The Minister said there would be a point where KPN-Telia would have the biggest shareholding, 35 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It will. I am informed that on the Stock Exchange once one has a shareholding of over 30 per cent it is significant. I am sure there is a deep significance to all of this. Apropos that this will arise, can I take it that because the Minister is relinquishing 50.1 per cent &ndash; she may retain 15 per cent or even zero per cent &ndash; and KPN-Telia may have been 35 per cent, the board membership, some of whom are the Minister's representatives, will not change and that it will have no effect on the sale? I am trying to tease out the possible consequences of someone having the biggest block, or is it likely that after the sale KPN-Telia will be considerable shareholders? The most shares that would be held by a city investor or institution would be 5 or 10 per cent. Is the Minister painting a scenario that KPN-Telia will be in the driving seat from now on, or for the foreseeable future? Will we have to be alert to certain situations, because this is <Col N="1340" /> important not only for the company but for the subscribers?</P>
      <P>Is it the position that for a short period before other new investors come in KPN-Telia will have 35 per cent, or will a board in Holland or a Scandinavian country decide our telephone charges, tariffs structures and so on? This would have importance in the context of how many shares are sold in the medium term.</P>

      <P>What is the proposed flotation date? Will the vast bulk of the legislation be implemented on the same date? Will the Minister tease out the implications and ramifications of her point about KPN-Telia having 35 per cent?</P>

      <P>The tentative date for flotation is the end of June with share dealing to begin in early July. However, as I continually stress, this depends on how the international telecommunications market is behaving at that point.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said he was intrigued because I said an item was mentioned in conversation. Last night talking to members of my family, none of whom will buy shares, I said I did not think people realised that KPN-Telia will be the major shareholder in July when it takes up its 15 per cent option. I suddenly thought of all the rí rá agus rúille búille that will take place when people ask what we have done and say that we have sold our souls and our shirts to a foreign company. However, that is the consequence of the 1996 decision. I do not disagree with it; I agree with the process. I made the comment to start a debate on the matter and I noted the caterwauling that is likely to take place when it happens.</P>
      <P>Usual corporate governance will apply. At present KPN-Telia has three directors from a total of 12. The normal rules will apply and the ODTR will have the regulatory role. The company will not decide the price of items. That is up to Ms Doyle and her proper governance.

    <Title>Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1998 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much legislation over the years in relation to planning. People should be able to understand it. However, that is not always the case because it can be confusing. For example, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, states:</P>
      <P>On the nineteenth day of October 1992, the remaining provisions of the Act of 1992, except paragraph (g) of section 19(4) as respects paragraph (b) of subsection (6) of the section inserted in the Act of 1976 by the said paragraph (g), shall come into force.</P>
      <P>People would not understand this complex legislation. Many Acts have been interpreted by the Judiciary in terms of understanding of the law.</P>
      <P>The planning laws permeate many aspects of our lives. The Bill is most important because it shows an appreciation in terms of listing various types of buildings. Most local authorities are currently putting together their draft development plans and members have been presented with a list of buildings to which conservation notices have been applied. There have been various discussions on the merits of the conservation notices but in my area it is important to place preservation orders on thatched houses because they are part of our heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area in which I live in west Limerick, there are many thatched cottages in Adare, which earned the title of Ireland's prettiest village some <Col N="1342" /> years ago. They are a focus for many of the people who visit the area. Tourists take photographs of them and the cottages are an important part of the town. The thatched house grant, which is still in operation, has helped to encourage people to replace thatching on houses. It is a good measure.</P>
    <P>Regarding planning, the onus appears to be on developers to prove the merits of their applications. The major change with regard to the planning laws probably took place after the famous Hanrahan case in the late 1980s. Prior to this, a planning application was made for an oil refinery in Tarbert and only one objection was made. There was a big psychological change in the late 1980s, particularly regarding the interpretation of industries.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to reconcile one pattern of planning law. Planning mainly relates to the environment and the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the main deals with the planning laws. Environmental considerations appear to be the dominant factor with regard to planning legislation. To what degree is there an emphasis on development in the planning laws? County enterprise boards and other mechanisms have been established to promote small industrial enterprises. How often do people who want to set up small businesses in sheds at the back of their property have to apply for planning permission when neighbours object, even when there is no intrusion or interference? How often do people who want to extend isolated buildings in the country have to seek approval by way of planning permission? How many industries which want to set up in this State are frightened off because of the hassles which permeate our planning laws? I am not advocating that we do away with these planning laws, but they should be couched to encourage these industries rather than impede them.</P>
    <P>After the Hanrahan case there seemed to be an anti-chemical culture. We know the rigours chemical companies faced. Merill, which wanted to set up in County Cork, walked away because of the objections at local level. The incinerator of the local hospital would have a higher level of emissions and the local creamery would produce more effluent. Sometimes events are overtaken with objections.</P>
    <P>I am a county councillor. We implement the planning laws &ndash; the planners make decisions with the support of the councillors &ndash; and we have never had a pattern of section 4s; the system has operated well. I have rarely seen a contravention of the draft development plan. If people come to me for help in expediting the planning process for planning on a main road, I tell them firmly they will not get planning permission. If they then ask me to move a section 4, I tell them I will not do it. They often then say they will go to a member of another party and I tell them to do that but that they will get the same answer.</P>
    <P>In many cases section 4s have been the ruination of a good planning process. It is interesting <Col N="1343" /> that section 4s dominate in counties with high volumes of tourism. There is often collusion between councils with regard to section 4s. Our council had the proper attitude and it would have made for good planning if other councils had followed its example. Recently the number of section 4s has fallen. When I mentioned section 4s and the attitude of councils towards them in this Chamber previously, I was berated by a councillor from another county for raising the matter.</P>
    <P>To a degree it is the planners who implement planning and they are stretched to the limit at present because of the buoyancy in the building industry. In that situation it is difficult for them to carry out even their normal workload. Local authorities are advertising for planning engineers who cannot be found.</P>

      <P>When I was putting my thoughts together on this matter, I read two documents which came my way, a letter from the Irish Planning Institute which welcomed this legislation, and an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Philip Geohagan and Michael Smith of An Taisce which also welcomed the Bill. The Irish Planning Institute welcomed it but felt it was too restrictive in its provisions and An Taisce felt it was not restrictive enough. The Minister must have done something right.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on honouring the commitment in the programme for Government. This is good legislation which speaks volumes about how far we have come in discussing environmental matters. We in Dublin city have just completed discussions on the city development plan. For a number of months the public were actively engaged with the local authority in discussing the future development of the city. When I compare the process this time to previous occasions, there was a greater air of understanding of the objectives which ought to be realised by a good development plan.</P>
      <P>The measures in this Bill ensure the protection and survival of our built heritage. I am glad it affords us an opportunity to look at things other than the Georgian squares, such as vernacular architecture which has much to contribute to the development of the State. The Bill has been produced in parallel with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, which introduced a national inventory of architectural heritage. The two Bills will complement each other. Every generation carries with it the onus to preserve our heritage and culture for future generations and it is important that we mark what we see constructively. The Bill will ensure we live up to our responsibilities to protect that built heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> I remember the sad times when some very fine buildings in this city were indiscriminately demolished and replaced by dreadful 1960s architecture. Many of the buildings from that period leave a great deal to be desired and do not enhance the city's architectural heritage one whit.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be workable and important because it is modern, robust and comprehensive, with financial resources dedicated to it. Also, employment of adequate expertise is envisaged. I read the September 1996 report of the interdepartmental working group on strengthening the protection of architectural heritage and I am satisfied the Minister has implemented its most significant findings in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a systematic approach to the protection of buildings. Local authorities have been criticised in the past for the divergent approaches they have taken to listing buildings for protection in their development plans. Even in our development plans, there was no commonality of approach &ndash; it depended on the chief planning officer and his architectural likes and dislikes. The Bill brings uniformity to the way buildings will be protected.</P>
    <P>The Bill facilitates the establishment of a formal record. Standard records will now be kept, overcoming the divergence between local authorities. In Dublin there is a sophisticated system of listing, but in other local authorities there is either no listing process of a multitude of listings. The distinctions are being removed. Local authorities will continue to have an ongoing role in identifying buildings for protection independently of the inventory. In recent years, buildings which are significant in their own right have come to the notice of Dublin Corporation. I recall one such building in Capel Street a number of years ago which escaped our attention and we were unable to do much about it. I also remember a number of important buildings in Parnell Square in the early 1980s which were then occupied by the College of Marketing and Design and are now part of the Irish Writers' Centre. These were fine buildings but because of loopholes in the planning legislation at the time, it was not possible to do much in terms of preservation. I remember excellent fireplaces and other items being stolen from those buildings, some of which were recovered but the majority were not.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect is the proposal to protect not only the interior and exterior of the buildings but also the curtilage. That is important when one considers the fine buildings at the Broadstone station in Phibsboro, a fine building in itself. Other important examples are Heuston Station and the railway works at Inchicore.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to making alterations to the decor of the building. It is important that the owner is made aware of any alteration, and the cost involved, and advised on complying with the provisions of the Bill. The provisions may be regarded as being onerous on the owners of protected buildings. In my experience the owners of protected buildings are caring people who are <Col N="1345" /> willing to take advice. If the expertise referred to in the Bill had been available to the people in some of the dilapidated buildings in Mountjoy Square, the level of dereliction would not have developed to the extent it did.</P>
    <P>In regard to buildings that are allowed to become dilapidated due to the neglect of the owner-occupier, it is important that the local authority can take an initiative. In recent weeks, those of us who represent the Dublin north west area have had to deal with the issue of what was a fine church-type building in Finglas village but for a variety of reasons, some of which had to do with lack of clarity about the ownership of the building, the local authority had to use both the dangerous buildings regulations and the derelict sites Act to come to the rescue of the local community and preserve the building to a certain extent. If this legislation had been in place, we would have been in a position to intervene to protect that building.</P>
    <P>Legislation is fine and we have a great record of enacting laws but of not sufficiently resourcing them. I am pleased the Government has a budget of £5 million per annum from 1999 onwards to ensure that the package of measures provided for in the Bill will be implemented. From that amount, approximately £4 million will be available for grant in aid for protected buildings.</P>
    <P>An important, exciting and innovative measure is the one to enable local authorities to employ conservation expertise. I am open to correction on this, but as far as I am aware, Dublin Corporation is the only local authority which has a conservation officer. We have a city architect and archaeologist and it is important that we have a city conservation officer also because the level of expertise required to deal with conservation matters is not readily available in the planning, engineering and architectural disciplines. A certain degree of objectivity is required also, somebody who can see the broader picture, and the conservation officer will do that. The expectation of the Government that 15 to 20 conservation officers will be employed to carry out their functions is important and I commend it.</P>
    <P>The role of Dúchas in providing advice to the conservation officers in local authorities is important. Although the name is relatively new, Dúchas has an expertise built up over the years through its excellent work with the Office of Public Works and in other areas including parks, monuments and the wildlife service. All of that experience can be brought to bear on its work.</P>
    <P>Section 1 refers to protecting the interior of the protected structure including its fixtures and features and the land and structures immediately around it. That aspect of the Bill will prove extremely worthwhile when it comes to protecting a streetscape or a square.</P>
    <P>I have had association for a number of years with the Castlepollard area of County Westmeath which has an excellent outdoor pursuits centre known as Cillure House, formally a dower house of Tullynally Castle. There are some magnificent <Col N="1346" /> stone buildings there lying semi-derelict, many of which were built in the early 1800s, but like many other buildings of their type they have been allowed to become progressively derelict. With this legislation and the resources available, buildings such as that can be enhanced and protected for future generations.</P>
    <P>Section 2 refers to the record of structures of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social and technical interest. We have a fund of that type of architecture which is crying out for protection and I welcome that provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to churches. There have been acts of vandalism to some churches which are not in use. Some of these have been in the ownership of the minority religions. A celebrated one here in Dublin was used as a paint and wallpaper shop at one stage. Another in Roscrea or Nenagh is being used as a restaurant. I am not certain that we crown ourselves in glory by allowing such buildings to be used in that fashion. I am impressed by the way the French, in particular, come to the rescue of church buildings of all denominations and ensure their features are preserved. Some years ago a church in Temple Street was developed as a multi-purpose arts and music centre.</P>
    <P>With a little work that church could have reverted to liturgical uses. We ought to encourage such measures by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a need to tighten the provisions for protecting streetscapes. St. Alphonsus monastery on the north of the city is home to an enclosed order. The monastery has a fine oratory which has been protected. However, the surrounding walls and grounds are not protected and, despite my wishes, planning permission has been granted for an intensive, high density housing development. This measure is accepted by the local community but it will overpower the adjacent single-storey houses on St. Alphonsus Road.</P>
    <P>I do not want to interfere with the planning appeal process. However, I find it difficult to understand that while we want to protect a fine, well-proportioned streetscape such as St. Alphonsus Road, including the monastery, at the same time we are allowing a major development of four or five storey blocks of apartments overlooking the monastery. I do not know if the Minister can include provisions in the Bill which would allow for a greater degree of sensitivity concerning such developments.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there is a realistic penalty of £1 million. Other speakers have been critical of this provision. However, even the most determined and devil-may-care developer would look askance at such a penalty. Too often local authorities have allowed unsightly signage is appear on significant buildings. I welcome the provision in the Bill allowing them to insist that such signage is removed. However, no penalties can be levied if the signage is not regarded by the planning authority as unauthorised. That is one of the weaker <Col N="1347" /> aspects of the provision. It is a little wishy-washy and may merit revisiting at some stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this excellent legislation and compliment him on listening carefully to Members' contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been widely welcomed in the Seanad and on both sides of the House. We have not given statutory protection to our built environment which forms an essential part of our landscape. Too often fine examples of architecture have been let go to rack and ruin or have been deliberately destroyed through ignorance, lack of appreciation or a &ldquo;don't care&rdquo; attitude. In some cases, sadly, the problem is due to a lack of funding or State support.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this Bill. I am not an architect but I have worked in the industry and have enormous respect and admiration for architects and the works of art they have created. Many works of architectural genius can be seen around the country but too few are appreciated. It takes talent, vision and an understanding of natural materials to produce buildings from conception to end product. Some of our most beautiful buildings are works of art which have been taken for granted until now.</P>
      <P>There are some magnificent buildings on the South Mall and the Grand Parade in Cork. These buildings are made from local limestone or sandstone and many have breathtaking interiors, including superbly detailed ceilings. Some of these buildings are owned by banks and have been meticulously maintained. However, I can quote examples where these institutions did not give other buildings they own the same degree of attention or respect.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives recognition to buildings of historical, architectural, artistic, scientific, social or technical interest. These are worthwhile provisions. However, I am worried about the length of the list. I was saddened when Tomás MacCurtain's house in Blackpool was destroyed. He was a former Lord Mayor of Cork and this building was pulled down. It was an ordinary house built in the late 19th century but was of significant historical value &ndash; unfortunately others did not agree. Could we get to a stage where buildings would be deemed worthy of inclusion on the list by some but not by others? Who will make the decisions?</P>
      <P>The Bill allows the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to issue guidelines to planning authorities to assist them in carrying out their functions and to ensure that a consistent approach to protecting the built heritage is adopted nationwide. It provides for discretion on the part of local authorities and integration and implementation of the guidelines in their development plans. However, it does not provide for a body to advise the Minister and the planning authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> I agree with Deputy Dukes's suggestion that all structures and buildings built prior to 1870 should be listed and protected under the legislation until it is agreed that they be delisted. This would ensure that our history and social fabric is protected. This suggestion is worthy of merit as, once gone, these buildings and structures can never be replaced. Many of the buildings and structures built before 1870 were made of natural stone and natural products and can never be replaced. It is worth considering that everything built prior to 1870 should be protected. We can then look at each building and structure and delist them as necessary.</P>
    <P>I am glad that structures of scientific importance are to be included in the list. Too often we do not give enough recognition to science and its contribution to our success as a nation. Last weekend I was driving around the coast and, on seeing a lighthouse, it occurred to me that lighthouses are also part of our heritage. Will they be protected? They should be because they play a part in our history and folklore. The list could be endless when one considers the structures it might be possible to include. Should every 18th century farmhouse in the country be included? Perhaps, but each case must be judged on its merits.</P>
    <P>However, this could give rise to many spurious objections to planning developments and applications. Already many cases which should not arise are taken to An Bord Pleanála. It worries me a little that the list will be too open and that there is not an advisory committee to decide what structures should and should not be included.</P>
    <P>Our nation has a wonderful and varied history and our traditions have deep roots. Sometimes we take them for granted. It is worthwhile to take this step in respecting our history and the society which preceded us. These times cannot be reclaimed but we should do all we can to preserve our heritage. It is our duty to preserve it and the culture and history which are the foundations of our civilisation for the sake of our children and their children.</P>
    <P>American visitors to this country are often obsessed with the quest to trace their relatives, roots and history. They do not have the same sense of culture or history as we have. We, like many Europeans, live with it daily and one can see that the Americans envy us that. They are forever chasing something they do not have, trying to find their roots in this and other European countries. We already have those roots but we do not give them enough attention. I hope this legislation will make us pay more attention to our culture. It is something we cannot replace.</P>
    <P>Many groups and organisations will welcome this Bill. However, they are worried that its aims will not be matched by funding. The Government announced an allocation of £3.9 million for grant aid for the conservation of buildings. Nobody, however, has quantified how much money will be necessary. My limited experience in this field as a result of my involvement in a number of projects <Col N="1349" /> indicates that £3.9 million will not go far. The restoration of Barryscourt Castle near Midleton, County Cork, could alone have legitimately absorbed that amount.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, restoration and the art work involved is highly skilled and labour intensive. As a result, it is enormously expensive. Take the National Gallery as an example. It was the subject of a recent decision by An Bord Pleanála. The building on the site was not listed by Dublin Corporation yet when the application by the National Gallery came before An Bord Pleanála it was noted that the building contained a ballroom which was worthy of protection. The board rejected the plans of the National Gallery which meant they had to be redrawn. There is now a scaled down version of the original plan but the original cost has increased by £1 million. The board's decision cost the National Gallery £1 million. This is just one type of problem which might be encountered when one considers the buildings and structure which might be included in the list under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I also mention the case of a tennis court which is the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála at present. It was donated to the State for use as an indoor tennis court but now it is being taken over to be a concert hall for the National Symphony Orchestra. That is a worthy cause but when buildings and structures are being preserved, they should be maintained for their original use. Too often one sees old churches used as restaurants and home furnishing stores or turned into concert halls. Buildings should be restored and maintained for their original purpose.</P>
    <P>I cannot reconcile the amount of money allocated for the appointment of conservation officers with the proposed number of 17. Fewer than that will be appointed. It is good to see a Bill which provides for the appointment of personnel to implement its provisions. When the Litter Act was passed, for example, sufficient personnel were not provided for, which is why we see few results from that legislation. I welcome that the issue of conservation officers has been addressed but I query the number mentioned. Considering the potential number of buildings and structures which could be included in the list, I am sure the officers will be inundated with work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the interiors of structures, including their fixtures, features and curtilages, are covered by the legislation. These features will be automatically protected and will no longer require specific listing. Too often one sees only the frontage of a building being preserved. The character of a building is dictated by its interior structure. Its function reflects its character so I am delighted that the provisions extend to the interiors of buildings. It is inside buildings where one sees beautiful artwork and wonderful fixtures and features. When buildings are demolished their beautiful fireplaces, doors and other internal fixtures disappear, usually to be used in other houses. They are usually works of art in them<Col N="1350" /> selves and part of our culture, heritage and history.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that works which would affect the character of a protected structure or a proposed structure or any element of that structure will require planning permission even when they would normally have been exempted under section 4 of the Planning Act. This requirement will cover works to the interior and exterior of a protected or proposed protected structure. It is extremely important to extend protection to the character of a building. The character of the building is part of our heritage and culture and it reflects the usage of the building and a certain time in history.</P>
    <P>There are excellent provisions in the Bill but my worry is about the financial commitments given by the Government.</P>

      <P>I am proud to share my time with both Deputies because Deputy Coveney represents a coastal area and has a great interest in seafaring and Deputy Deasy, to whom I have spoken many times on these issues, comes from another coastal community and also has a tremendous interest in the sea.</P>
      <P>Because of the growth in international tourism, there is a growing trend towards activity-related holidays, but the water-based tourism market in Ireland remains underdeveloped. Until recently the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources was not active in the area of water-based tourism which did not slot into the normal work of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Institute produced a strategy document in 1998 which highlighted a significant role for water-based tourism and leisure. It has the potential to create jobs in many areas that are economically disadvantaged, some of which are peripheral parts of our country. The whole water-based tourism and leisure business makes a sig<Col N="1351" /> nificant contribution to our economy. It has an estimated value of £392 million per annum and supports in excess of 14,500 employees. It includes adventure centres as a smaller component of the water-based tourism and leisure business. We are fortunate to have 2,000 miles of coastline and also an extensive lake network with great potential for water-based activities associated with adventure centres. We are also fortunate that the inland waters and the coastline are accessible to our major population centres.</P>
    <P>Marine pollution is mainly confined to the coastlines close to our major cities. Most of our coastline remains unpolluted and is ideal for water-based activities. The uncrowded nature of most of our coastline makes it popular with tourists. If funding were provided by local authorities or by the Department for the many ports, inlets and small harbours which are falling into disrepair, it would greatly enhance the profile of our marine, tourism and leisure activities.</P>
    <P>The Marine Institute, in a strategy document which embraced tourism and leisure, recognised that user friendly legislation regulating commercial activities in the water-based leisure sector, especially with regard to safety, is needed. In introducing this Bill, I am conforming to the necessity for a Bill for water-based activity centres for people under 18 years of age. I am pleased to introduce this Bill as a voluntary code is not sufficient to protect young people engaged in water sports at marine adventure centres. It is essential that such centres be licensed and their activities supervised by officials from the Health and Safety Authority. This Bill proposes a new licensing and policing system under the aegis of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>Over the years, with the growth in the tourism industry, there has been a dramatic expansion in the number of outdoor pursuit centres engaged in adventure sports. These adventure centres engage in such diverse activities as canoeing, sailing, wind-surfing, mountain hiking, pony trekking, field studies, archery, orienteering, hill-walking, power boating, rock climbing snorkelling, abseiling sea kayaking and surfing. The location of the adventure centres, whether on the coastline or inland, will dictate the different activities carried on in these locations. The adventure centres cater for all age groups but are most popular with young children and young adults.</P>
    <P>In their advertising the centres specify the age group for which they cater, with young children from seven years and upwards attending them. When looking at some Bord Fáilte literature it surprised me to find that one centre was accepting even younger children from the age of three and upwards. Many of them cater for children from the age of seven and upwards and many cater for all ages. In marketing these centres abroad, Bord Fáilte states:</P>
    <P>Adventure sports are by their nature hazardous and participants should be aware that no <Col N="1352" /> liability will attach to outdoor pursuits centres in respect of accidents caused by or resulting from their inexperience or negligence. They participate at their own risk and are advised to carry their own personal accident insurance policy.</P>
    <P>In response to that, let me remind the House that we are talking about young children of six, seven, eight or nine years old. Parents need the comfort of knowing that if they send a young child to an adventure centre it is licensed and there is a proper policing system in place.</P>
    <P>Currently, the Association for Adventure Sports, AFAS, does a good job in setting standards for adventure centres relating to safety, safety procedures, safety of equipment and qualification of staff, and issues an annual list of approved centres. The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation provides limited funding on an annual basis. I emphasise the very limited funding for this body which operates this code very much on a voluntary basis. The organisations included under the umbrella of AFAS include: the Irish Amateur Archery Association, responsible for archery; the Irish Canoe Union, responsible for canoeing, kayaking and canoe surfing; the Speleological Union of Ireland, responsible for caving; the Mountaineering Council of Ireland, responsible for hill-walking, mountaineering and rock climbing; the Irish Orienteering Association, responsible for orienteering; and the Irish Surfing Association, responsible for surfing.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the Minister accepts this Bill, the Association for Adventure Sports will still have a strong role in the area of adventure sports and the Bill will strengthen its role. I am not saying that under this Bill the Association for Adventure Sports standards should be abolished. All I am saying is that if it operates on a voluntary basis, it would help to know that the strength of a Bill like this is behind it in the operation of its code of conduct.</P>
    <P>Over the years it has been the Department's policy that self-regulation by individuals engaged in water sports and the representative organisations is the most practical and efficient approach to the safety of such activities. Successive Ministers for the Marine have supported self-regulation. However, interestingly, in a reply in the Dáil on 27 May 1998 the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, stated that following the tragic accident off Dunmore East in February 1995, which resulted in the death of two young men who were members of a canoeing party from the local adventure centre, his Department, while recognising that self-regulation remained an important option, had come to the conclusion that some form of regulation of adventure centres would be desirable to provide for an improvement in the safety of people availing of the activities at these centres. Ten months ago the Minister appeared to be very supportive, and in dealing with questions in committee I got the feeling he was interested in strengthening the <Col N="1353" /> existing situation. Now is the time for positive action. He further stated:</P>
    <P>I have recently taken up with my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, who is responsible for sport in general, the possible introduction of mandatory regulation of the safety of adventure centres.</P>
    <P>It is now ten months since the Minister made that statement. Within the Bill I have framed, the Minister has the opportunity to accept it as being suitable for outdoor activity centres engaged in water sports. It could also be extended to all activity centres in due course. In framing the Bill, I was conscious that many outdoor adventure centres are not commercial operations, as such, but are under the jurisdiction of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The present situation regarding adventure centres is fragmented as the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has no statutory responsibility for the majority of them which are private commercial operations. Many such operations on our coastline offer a range of potentially dangerous activities in potentially dangerous locations, and many of their clients are children. The Department of Education and Science, through the vocational education committees, also operates nine outdoor education centres. Other vocational education committees operating adventure centres are seeking recognition from the Department of Education and Science. I estimate there are about 30 adventure centres in all.</P>
    <P>In December 1994 the owner of a leisure centre in Britain was sentenced to three years imprisonment and fined £60,000 after a fatal canoeing accident involving a party of school children in March 1993. Four teenagers died in that accident in Lyme Bay. In 1995 the British Government introduced a Bill to regulate activity centres. As this business has rapidly expanded in recent years, it is now timely for us to introduce similar legislation.</P>
    <P>It is now possible to establish an adventure centre but one is dependent upon voluntary recognition by AFAS with regard to safety standards and procedures laid down for the operation of such a centre. It is also my understanding that it is not compulsory for a centre to be under the umbrella of AFAS.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the ongoing encouragement of the parent whose son lost his life in a canoeing accident at Dunmore East. I have discussed the matter with the father on many occasions. With regard to this Bill, he is particularly anxious that some form of regulation should be in place, under the control of the Minister and with the strength of the Health and Safety Authority, for the operation of these adventure centres. I hope the Bill will be accepted by the Government. If the Minister is not happy with the text it should be possible to amend it on Committee Stage. It is desirable to have such legislation in operation. Although it will provide little comfort at this stage for someone who has lost a child as a result <Col N="1354" /> of such an accident, it would provide comfort for parents whose children will use adventure centres in future. They will know that if their children go to an adventure centre it will be properly regulated by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, be policed on an ongoing basis by the Health and Safety Authority and will receive a licence. If the legislation achieves that, it will strengthen the outdoor adventures centres and further legitimise them as far as parents are concerned. Such comfort already exists for children who attend the outdoor education centres operated under the aegis of vocational education committees which come under the Department of Education and Science. The Department will carry out an investigation if anything goes wrong. It is desirable to have such an organisation to fall back on and which has a share of strength and muscle.</P>
    <P>In framing this Bill I hoped the Minister would take a step in the right direction in taking the matter under his umbrella. Many of the activities in such adventure centres, whether inland or on the coast, are water based. If necessary it will be possible to include all adventure centres under the legislation.</P>
    <P>At present, coastal adventure centres would apparently be the responsibility of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, even though that Department will say it has no such responsibility. On the other hand the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation under the Minister, Deputy McDaid, will say that it has no responsibility for the matter, apart from AFAS for which the Minister provides funding. The matter needs to be tidied up between both Departments.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the Health and Safety Authority to issue licences on behalf of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Under this section, the authority would have discretion as to whether an application would be refused or granted. If an applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the Health and Safety Authority he may appeal to the High Court upon receipt of a certificate outlining the reasons for the authority's decision.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides the Minister with the power to make regulations which will provide for the cases or circumstances in which persons providing facilities for adventure centres are required to hold a licence and to set safety requirements to be satisfied by any applicant to hold a licence.</P>
    <P>Section 8 makes it an offence to contravene a provision of a regulation made under this Bill or to knowingly or recklessly give false information to the authority for the purpose of obtaining a licence.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be accepted by the Government. Parents who send their children to outdoor activity centres deserve to be assured by the State that adequate safety standards are in place. As the Minister with statutory responsibility for the marine sector, Deputy Woods has an obligation <Col N="1355" /> to provide these assurances by introducing safety standards on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, who is from a coastal county, will recognise that it is essential to do something positive in this direction. I commend the Bill to the House and sincerely hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Finucane for introducing the Bill and am pleased to be involved in, I hope, getting it accepted. As an island nation we have a huge coastline to population ratio. All our major centres of population are situated on the coast or by lakes or large rivers. These include Dublin, Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Tralee, Limerick, Galway, Sligo and so many other smaller towns. It is not surprising, therefore, that we are seeing an increase in the number of people using water as a source of recreation. An industry is growing up that provides recreational and adventure activities which is centred on water based activities. More and more parents view the sea as a healthy and productive resource for sport and recreation for their children. There are many harbours, bays and sheltered inlets on our coastline that are completely under-utilised from a marine recreation point of view. So many of these areas are just waiting to be developed into potentially exciting adventure, recreation and educational centres. More and more people are realising that water activities can be great fun and very enjoyable. Many of them do not realise the potential danger that water holds, though a great number of Irish people know how lethal the sea and rivers can be. I consider myself very lucky to have practically grown up on the sea and to have been given the opportunity to participate in almost every water based activity one could think of. For a number of summers I worked as a sailing instructor and as a lifeguard, both in Ireland and abroad. I know how much the sea has to offer people of all ages, and young people in particular, from the recreation and sporting points of view.</P>
      <P>We should encourage the development of water sports and activity centres to allow as many young people as possible to appreciate the joys of learning how to surf, sail, scuba dive, wind surf or swim. However, if we encourage this sector, we must also take on the huge responsibility of ensuring that our young people are safe in what they are doing. The water can be a dangerous and tragic place if it is not respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that outdoor activity centres which provide water based sports activities for children under 18 should be strictly regulated. At present there is no statutory regulation of outdoor activity centres, though many of these centres are very professionally run and have superb safety records. They have highly qualified staff members implementing a voluntary safety code, but because of the potential dangers a properly regulated safety standard must be implemented throughout the country. This will be <Col N="1356" /> a headache for many people in the water activity business, but it is necessary if we are serious about minimising the risk of water tragedies. This Bill proposes a licensing system to be set up by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in co-operation with the Health and Safety Authority. Effectively, the Authority would implement the licensing system, make proposals for safety regulations and look at each licence application separately. Depending on the activities being provided and where those activities were to be based, the Authority would decide on suitable regulations and conditions. It is recognised that that Authority will need extra resources to carry out what will initially be a tedious and laborious process, and the Department of the Marine must finance this.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also ensure that it will be within the power of the Authority to withdraw a license in a case where conditions and regulations are not being adhered to. If we are to maximise our recreational water resources and to provide young people in particular with water sport facilities, we must ensure that safety is the priority, regardless of the cost or inconvenience. Too many young lives have been lost in lakes, rivers and the sea for us not to act for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Finucane on introducing this Bill. The Government should have done it in the past two years, as its necessity is quite obvious. With affluence there is much more outdoor activity as more people take advantage of their leisure time. However, many leisure activities are highly dangerous, and as Deputy Coveney rightly said, one does not mess about in boats on the sea or in rivers, canals or lakes. People risk their lives by doing so, and if statutory regulations have to be introduced to ensure the situation is regulated, particularly when it comes to adventure centres, so be it. It is amazing that we have no laws to regulate such activities. It should have been quite obvious years ago that there was a necessity for these laws, and the fact that it is regulated in Britain should have brought the need for such laws to our notice. There would obviously be a greater amount of assiduity in Britain, given the greater density of population, but this is a growing form of activity, and it will have to be regulated.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister brought in some regulations, but those are not sufficient. The Lyme Bay incident to which Deputy Finucane referred, in which four youngsters drowned, is a case in point. The owner of the leisure centre involved was sent to prison for a lengthy period. Those children were under his care, and when they drowned he suffered the consequences: a lengthy jail sentence and a severe fine. That is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By pure coincidence, in February 1995 I happened to be in Dunmore East on the afternoon of the tragedy involving the canoeists. At approximately 3.30 p.m. I saw the canoeists in the water close to shore, and I was appalled that any<Col N="1357" /> one would be left out on the open sea in any craft on a day like that. Every fishing boat in the Dunmore fleet and Waterford harbour was tied up, as there had been gale warnings coming thick and fast all day and the previous night. Strong gales were forecast. There can be no craft more susceptible to bad weather than a canoe, as the bulk of the canoe is out of the water. How children could be left out in those conditions is beyond comprehension. I said so at the time and I say so again. That children were left out without their parents' permission can only be termed criminal. There is no point trying to fudge the issue.</P>
    <P>In future there should be laws that regulate the conditions in which children take to the sea or rivers in boats or who get involved in outdoor activity. Those laws should also regulate the supervision provided for such children. This must be done, as the sea is cruel and takes no prisoners. The Minister of State lives in a maritime county like Deputy Coveney and me. He has seen many tragedies over the years, and those tragedies primarily involved commercial fishermen, many of whom took a chance because the laws regulating their industry were so severe, and, in many cases, unfair. They took risks and paid with their lives. I could name 12 people from my area who were in the commercial fishing category who died in the past 20 years. Deputy Byrne would be able to name a similar number of people. A leisure boat sank off Duncannon four or five years ago, and several people died.</P>

      <P>The Minister must see the need to regulate these activities. People should not be permitted to go out in boats without the basic necessities such as life jackets and flares. Boats should be seaworthy and capable of withstanding the weather conditions. You may remember, sir, that after a boating tragedy off the coast of Clare, a law was passed to regulate the number of fare-paying passengers who could be carried on a boat. Any boat licensed to carry passengers must now undergo stringent examinations. The rules are quite severe and they were introduced following that tragedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that the Government will allow this Bill to pass. If not, we will see more tragedies such as we saw in Dunmore East and elsewhere. It is sad that good weather brings a number of tragic deaths from drowning. We see tragedies on beaches, rivers and lakes when there is fine summer weather. This Bill goes some way towards imposing order on these activities. Danger is present in swimming, sailing, cruising at sea or on inland water<Col N="1358" /> ways and sea angling. Several deaths have occurred since sail boarding became popular 15 or 20 years ago. Sail boarders have been swept out to sea and have died from hypothermia or drowning. People use speed boats, often with very little awareness of the dangers involved, particularly when they take them out of inland waters to the merciless open sea. Water scooters are beautiful to look at on an enclosed water such as a lake but deadly when taken out of a harbour or estuary. There are many such newly popular activities and we have not legislated to control them. We ask tonight that this controlling legislation be passed. It is not too much to ask.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will consider the points that have been made. We are not kill joys, we do not wish to stop people enjoying themselves. We want to save people, particularly children and young people, who take part in activities which are deadly dangerous and where there is no regulation. We want to see proprietors and those who are benefiting financially from these activities held responsible when problems arise. The Bill meets an elementary need. I hope there is consensus on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil áthas orm bheith anseo anocht chun páirt a ghlacadh i ndíospóireacht ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, was most anxious to be here for the debate but is detained in Brussels because of his involvement in a meeting of EU Fisheries Ministers. I am sure everyone in the House will join with me in wishing the Minister well in his endeavours on behalf of the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us deals with a very important issue. I, too, compliment Deputy Finucane on his initiative in bringing forward his proposals which give us the opportunity to discuss and debate the various issues arising from the operation of adventure centres and the philosophy which should underpin the legislative approach to be adopted in dealing with them. I understand there are upwards of 100 centres run by private interests, scouting bodies or vocational education committees currently operating all round the country providing training and participation in a number of activities. These range from sailing, power boating, scuba diving, windsurfing, hill walking, pony trekking, canoing, archery, rock climbing, abseiling, caving, pot holing, orienteering, rafting, skiing, jet skiing, parachuting and sky diving to kayaking and bungee jumping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All adventure activities, by their very nature, involve a certain amount of thrill and excitement which is what attracts participants to them but the obverse of the coin is that, fundamentally, they also involve an element of risk. The challenge facing individual participants who partake of such activities entirely on their responsibility without reference to any organisation or body and commercial, sporting and public bodies who provide <Col N="1359" /> such activities in an organised way is to minimise and control the level of that risk. Individuals indulging in such activities on their own account have to take full responsibility for their own actions and, apart from any other consideration, anyone who provides organised activities for members of the general public, other than sporting clubs, is required under the general law to exercise a duty of care towards their customers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as they are workplaces for those involved in the leadership or training activities, adventure centres are regulated and inspected under the Health and Safety Act which requires safety statements to be in place in the interest of the protection of the workers involved. I have consulted my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Kitt, about this and he advises me that the Health and Safety Authority is primarily responsible for issues concerning workplace health and safety. The statutory remit of the authority does not, however, extend to matters of general public safety which is a much wider concept than that of occupational safety.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, under which the authority was established, relates to occupational safety and health in places of work. It is concerned with the protection of workers from risks to their safety and health which might arise in the course of the work, physical risks to their safety, injury or death from the improper use of work equipment or other unsafe work practices and health risks such as the development of occupational diseases from working with various substances. The 1989 Act is intended to protect the public only to the extent that where a danger arises from work activities or processes carried on in areas where the public might be present, either on the premises or in the vicinity of where the work is taking place, those responsible for the work should take suitable measures to prevent such danger. For these reasons, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, is opposed to the piecemeal extension of the authority's remit as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that centres currently operating provide a considerable level of employment very often in remote areas where alternative employment opportunities are few and far between. Nevertheless, we must accept that there are currently no standards provided in law, governing levels of competence of instructors or leaders, equipment or procedures. Such standards would reasonably have the aim of ensuring that persons engaging in activities at adventure centres are not exposed to avoidable danger through incompetence or inexperience of instructors, faulty or misused equipment or unsafe procedures. It is probably the case that participants very often have little or no experience, as was mentioned by all three speakers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> These considerations do not apply solely to water-based activities. They apply across the whole range of adventure activities I mentioned earlier and this is the main difficulty that Deputy Finucane's Bill causes for me as Minister of State in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. I do not accept that adventure activities which are water-based are in some sense more dangerous or acquiring regulation to an extent greater than activities that take place in other spheres &ndash; in many instances, the very opposite is the case. I do not want to go into the area of one competing with the other because the hearts of Deputies Finucane, Coveney and Deasy are in the right place.</P>
    <P>To move forward on the basis of this Bill would mean that adventure centres in the marine area would be discriminated against as against those in the non-marine area. It also raises the question of the position of those centres currently providing marine and non-marine activities at the same location which would thereby be placed in the anomalous situation of being tightly regulated in respect of some operations, while being left entirely to their own devices in respect of others conducted from the same premises, some of which as I already indicated may be considered to be more dangerous and requiring more regulation. Many of the outdoor pursuit centres around our coast, particularly those run by the vocational education committees, would be cases in point.</P>
    <P>What is required is a comprehensive review of the regulatory requirements for all adventure centres and all types of adventure activities currently provided in the State. In that context, this Bill, which I accept is brought forward with the best of motives, is premature. We should wait until we have had detailed consideration of the range of issues arising in the area of adventure centres as a whole before we proceed to act.</P>
    <P>This is what was done in the UK in the Activity Centres (Young Persons' Safety) Act, 1995, on which I presume Deputy Finucane has drawn heavily in drafting his measure as it seems to mirror that legislation almost word for word. I find it difficult, therefore, to understand why the Deputy restricted the Bill to water based activities only when the model on which it was based deals with all adventure activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>We said we would start with water based activities and that it could be extended to other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's point and welcome his initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UK Act provided a framework for licensing and policing all adventure centres under the aegis of the health and safety authorities there and provided for making ancillary regulations by the Secretary of State for Employment and Education who was given overall responsibility in the matter. I understand the reason the health and safety people in Britain were involved in <Col N="1361" /> implementing the legislation was that they came under the aegis of the Employment and Education Department. In any event, I am informed they have a much wider remit than the Health and Safety Authority here.</P>
    <P>I further understand that in practice the implementation of the UK legislation has given rise to some difficulties and that a review of it is currently taking place after only three years in operation. We must take note of the UK experience, having regard to the practical difficulties which have arisen in implementing its legislation and adapt its system to the specific requirements applying in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by various representative industry bodies that they are most anxious to have in place a regime which guarantees the utmost level of safety for all those participating in any form of adventure sport in Ireland. However, they insist that any such regime, whether legislative or self-regulating or a mixture of both, should be all inclusive and fully comprehensive, that is, it must apply to all centres, whether in the public or private sectors and to all types of activity. This is particularly important in our circumstances as adventure activity is so much a part of the tourism infrastructure here. With that in mind, a broad-ranging review has begun of the safety of all adventure centres here, involving senior officials of all the Departments involved, including my Department, the Departments of Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Tourism and Sport and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This review is expected to be completed by the end of June and the outcome will be acted on speedily as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>In the meantime efforts are being made by my Department to improve the levels of safety awareness generally among those who use the sea, either for profit or pleasure, and to try to engender a safety culture among our seagoing population, which is the aim of Deputy Finucane's Bill. There is an ongoing publicity campaign in train whereby the Department in conjunction with the National Safety Council, the Irish Sailing Association, the RNLI, the Irish Canoe Union and other interested Departments prepares appropriate safety material for release. Last year a total of six informational and advisory full colour leaflets were produced in the &ldquo;Safety on the Water&rdquo; series. They included: man overboard procedures for fishing vessels; man overboard procedures for pleasure craft; emergency procedures for fishing vessels; emergency procedures for pleasure craft; notice to users of jet skis and fast power craft and lifejackets and buoyancy aids.</P>
    <P>These have been widely disseminated to all user bodies, including all known adventure centres and were circulated during the course of the various open days and rescue demonstrations organised by the Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department around the coast. During 1999 it is planned to carry out a customer survey to <Col N="1362" /> measure the level of public awareness and the effectiveness of this publication programme and it will be adapted accordingly if necessary and additional material generated. As part of the awareness programme, a total of 29 marine notices issued from the Department's safety services during 1998. These dealt with a wide range of safety issues, including fishing vessel safety and notification of new standards for shipping generally.</P>
    <P>We now have total coverage of the whole coastline on VHF radio through a network of master and slave radio stations operated by IMES on a 24 hour basis. This means that anyone in difficulty on the coastline who possesses a VHF radio can contact IMES immediately and secure assistance in the same way as they can be contacted through the general emergency number 999. Additional VHF stations are constantly being added to improve the level of coverage and to eliminate the number of areas where the operation of VHF is poor because of local topographic conditions. The Department is also in the process of providing the necessary infrastructure for the adoption of digital selective calling at all coastal VHF sites by the end of 1999. This system enables IMES to be called automatically by pressing a button on one's radio without the need to operate a handset and deliver a spoken message thus increasing the chances of rescue in an emergency.</P>
    <P>Should anyone have the misfortune to get into difficulties off our coast in present circumstances there is now in place a considerable array of equipment and resources which can be summoned to their aid. I am sure everyone joins with me in thanking IMES, the RNLI, lighthouse operators, the Garda and Civil Defence for their wonderful response to those in difficulty around our coasts. The equipment and resources include two medium load Sikorski helicopters based at Shannon and Dublin providing an all-weather 24-hour response with a capability of rescuing up to 14 people 200 miles from shore and an in-air response time of 15 minutes between 7.30 a.m. and 9 p.m. and 45 minutes otherwise; one Air Corps Dauphin helicopter based at Finner Camp, County Donegal; and one Air Corps Alouette helicopter based at Waterford airport, which will be upgraded shortly to a Dauphin giving all-weather 24 hour capability and ensuring that Ireland has a world class helicopter search and rescue coverage. I am delighted this development will cover the south-east. We are very happy to have strong associations with and great co-operation from the RAF who have assisted us on many occasions.</P>
    <P>We have a network of 50 IMES coastal units located around the coast, manned by IMES volunteers and a network of RNLI all-weather and inshore lifeboats which is in the process of being constantly upgraded in this their 175th anniversary year. I have been around the coasts on many occasions at launches and to celebrate the wonderful work of the RNLI which, as Deputies know, is a voluntary organisation. The search and <Col N="1363" /> rescue facilities of my Department are currently in the process of being extended to inland waterways so that anyone getting into difficulties on, say, the Shannon waterway or the large lakes in the west and the midlands will be on the same footing as those at sea.</P>
    <P>As announced by the Minister some time ago, work is proceeding on the establishment of a coastguard service which will be based initially on the IMES headquarters and coastal networks. I am very conscious of what Deputy Finucane said that prevention is better than cure and we all agree with Deputy Deasy in asking for respect for the sea, whether it is two feet of water or 200 feet. On a personal note, I am very glad recognition is being given to the personnel of the IMES coastal units who are available on an all year round basis to help with search and rescue efforts in local areas. Apart from their incorporation into the new coastguard I was very glad to be associated with a recent event in Dublin Castle when gallantry, meritorious and long service medals were presented to a large number of long serving members.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that questions of safety of life at sea are receiving the top priority they deserve in my Department at all times, and that will continue.  I refer to an incident which occurred four years ago in Waterford which very probably prompted Deputy Finucane to introduce the proposal under discussion and was mentioned by three Deputies already, the unfortunate deaths of two young canoeists at Dunmore East in February 1995. My home overlooks Waterford estuary. The person who was in the water for eight hours came to shore about half a mile from my home. The following day I spent some time looking for one of the two who, happily, was found. The other unfortunately was not. Living on the coast I know full well and understand and appreciate the intention behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the tragedy at Dunmore East, my Department looked at all the circumstances surrounding that sad event and made the following safety recommendations for canoeing activity on or near the sea or on large open lakes: all equipment including canoes, helmets, buoyancy aids, paddles, cagoules and both wet and dry suits should be made more visible by attaching retroreflective tape &ndash; this would assist the rescue services in locating a person or canoe in the water, especially in heavy seas and poor visibility, be it by way of lifeboat or helicopter; all persons should have a whistle capable of being used in the water, which should be attached to the wrist; a hand flare should be issued to each canoeist and the leader of a group of canoeists should have at least one parachute flare; the leader of a group should carry a handheld marine VHF radio and be capable of operating it; the area of operation of canoe training should be carefully defined and the persons in charge of training should be made fully aware of such areas; a checklist of all the <Col N="1364" /> necessary requirements, including weather forecasts and updates as appropriate, should be complied with prior to departure, simple necessities all too often forgotten; the leader of a group should inform the relevant local authorities, for example, the harbour office, pilot station and coast radio station, giving them the time of departure, area of operation, expected time of arrival, number in group and type and numbers of equipment in use; anyone going to sea for leisure purposes should talk to experienced people such as fishermen in the local harbour and make use of the resources already in place; and lifejackets should be worn for sea or open water canoeing.</P>
    <P>Those recommendations were incorporated in a leaflet issued in 1997 as part of my Department's information campaign and I have no doubt that they will save many lives in the future no matter what comes about as a result of our deliberations. Deputy Finucane is to be complimented on his initiative in relation to this important issue. All sides of the House recognise the need for progress in this area. As far as this matter is concerned, I would like to think we are all on the same team. I accept that no one is trying to score political points. We are all trying to eliminate the dangers for as many as possible. Buddy Miller, the retired secretary of the Rosslare lifeboat, used to say at the beginning of every year that he would like to see a year pass without a drowning at sea and that is what we want to achieve.</P>

      <P>Molaim an Teachta Ó Finnucáin as ucht an mBille um Ionaid Ghníomhaíochta (Sábháilteacht Uisce do Dhaoine Óga), 1998 a chur os comhair na Dála. I compliment Deputy Finucane for bringing this important Bill before the House. As the Minister of State said, the genesis of this legislation dates to a tragedy in my constituency in February 1995 when a young man and a boy were lost. I know the young man's family and in addition to the tragedy they endured a period of great anguish and pain when waiting for the remains to be recovered. A considerable time passed before his body was found, off the Welsh coast. This terrible tragedy brought deep sorrow to two families but that the Oireachtas is discussing and addressing the issue of safety may bring some small comfort to them. Much as we regret what happened and restate our sympathy to those bereaved, we now look forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a large Bill but it contains what is necessary and the Labour Party is happy to support it. I have some comments, which are offered in a constructive way. The Bill should define the word &ldquo;safety&rdquo;, which only occurs once in the text. The legislation gives a great deal of power to the Minister &ndash; it seems that those who did not fulfil the conditions of licences issued under the Bill could be brought before the courts on indictable offences arising from regulations introduced by a Minister. This is not common and I am not sure it is a good idea. Indictable offences cannot be <Col N="1365" /> created by regulations under the European Communities Act, for instance. I gather the Government will not support the Bill but the Labour Party would wish to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage, should we reach it.</P>
    <P>Activities relating to water, such as leisure centre activities and canoeing, are becoming much more popular and are part of our tourism and leisure facilities. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds can benefit from having access to water sport. These activities are good for young people. However, self-regulation is not appropriate to this sector because the sea is dangerous, unforgiving and can change rapidly. I take the Minister's point that the spirit of this debate is constructive. We seek to address an important area and to introduce a regulatory regime which will dramatically improve the position, in so far as regulations can improve safety.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be fleshed out. Whereas regulations can be introduced for some areas, the main offences should be listed in the primary legislation. There is merit in giving the licensing function to the Health and Safety Authority &ndash; although this is not the view of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt &ndash; because it makes use of an existing structure with a great repository of experience in health and safety. The Bill should also address the policing of regulations. The HSA has safety officers but we need specialist inspectors who could keep a close eye on water related activities requiring licensing. The Bill relates to activities provided for people aged under 18 and therefore the regulations will not cover adults. There may be a constitutional reason for this.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the legislation is not being accepted and allowed proceed to Committee Stage. I have no doubt Deputy Finucane would be as flexible as possible in terms of changes which other colleagues, including the Government, would want to introduce to improve the legislation. That the legislation is being stopped at Second Stage, given the strong probability that the Government will vote it down, is regrettable. There is a need to flag concern about this issue, that this State is serious about protecting those under 18 years of age who take part in water related activities, that those who conduct the activities and provide facilities and so on get a clear message that because of the inherent danger in these activities only first class standards of operation are acceptable and in the event of carelessness the State will deal effectively with it.</P>
    <P>Given the unanimity, I ask the Minister to consider the position and not to oppose the Bill on Second Stage. It is not contrary to any legitimate aspiration of the Government. Therefore it should be accepted on Second Stage so that it can be further debated, improved and strengthened. If it got to that stage the Government would wish to have a large input.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister of State, I introduced regulations. In areas where public safety is involved there is a need to state clearly in primary <Col N="1366" /> legislation the basic offences, although that is done to some extent in relation to the sentences. The sentences relate to regulations that have to be introduced. It is important that the primary legislation clearly and unequivocally states the matters which could be the subject of indictable prosecution down the line.</P>
    <P>The incident that gave rise to this legislation was a terrible canoeing tragedy. As the Minister said, the development of so many other activities is a large part of what is happening throughout the country. Legislation can anticipate other developments. If the legislation contains the right framework, the licensing process can reach other activities that may be provided in the future. This legislation arises from a great tragedy and a determination that, as far as possible, tragedies such as this could never happen again. There is always a need to signal danger. As a former teacher, I know it is not easy to make young people aware of the dangers. Much good work is done through the Department of the Environment and Local Government and local authorities in terms of swimming activities during the summer. Some voluntary bodies provide expert coastguards and so on. Many competent and professional organisations outside the State or local authority sector lack the necessary funding to provide services.</P>
    <P>It took some considerable time to get the lifeguard service in place at a beach in my constituency where there are certain difficulties. Apart from the Bill and the particular issue of licensing and the regulation of that regime afterwards, a comprehensive study should be conducted of all water activities in which young people take part. The black spots should be noted and there should be a definite policy and commitment &ndash; as well as the necessary resources to close off the dangerous areas. Accidents take place each year. Young people swim in areas from which they have been warned to keep away. While the warning signs are visible they still find their way to these areas where tragedies occur.</P>
    <P>There is a gravitation towards the cities. For the balanced development of young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, it is important to gain access to adventure in a rural context whether maritime or inland. That type of activity is important when children develop a competence at particular sporting activities. It builds up their self-esteem and makes them more effective.</P>
    <P>A properly regulated industry involving water related activities could provide much employment. Some economists hold the view that the tourism and leisure area has the most potential in terms of job creation. Some of this worthwhile employment could be year round and would give children from urban areas an opportunity to take part in healthy activities which are in general denied to them. However, there must be the highest standards of safety.</P>
    <P>The long title of the Bill mentions adventure activities, including provision for the imposition <Col N="1367" /> of requirements relating to safety. There have been too many tragedies involving water although accidents can happen in the best regulated circumstances. However, much more can be done in terms of regulation. I was most impressed by the work done with young people whose lives were not progressing as they should. Involvement in water and adventure activities was of tremendous benefit to them. It made them better people and more effective citizens. They had a more positive contribution to make to society.</P>
    <P>The events outside Dunmore East in February 1995 which led to the loss of young people's lives are irreversible. All the regret and sympathy we feel will not change that position. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the Government does not oppose Second Stage of the Bill. The legislation would ensure that something good came of that terrible tragedy. I make these comments in a constructive sense and do not wish to score political points. That type of politics is unbecoming and should not be any part of this debate.</P>
    <P>Additions should be made to strengthen the Bill. The Minister and his Department have more expertise available to them than members of the Opposition. I ask the Minister to reconsider the Bill in the context of whatever amendments are required to ensure it is effective, acceptable and most importantly, respected. The issue is one which requires the Government to be open and to allow the Bill to proceed to the next Stage. No face would be lost in allowing that, although that is not the Government's motivation in opposing Second Stage. There should be a rethink and the Bill should not be opposed on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Whatever work is necessary in terms of amendments should begin on both sides. Our objective should be to ensure, at the end of that process, that there is legislation of which we can be proud and which will help the people who were bereaved to feel comforted that something good and significant emerged from the tragedy. I do not wish to present emotive arguments but opposing the Bill would send out the wrong signal and this would be unfortunate. I accept the Minister's sincerity on this matter, but he indicated the Government intends to oppose the Bill and that is the wrong way forward. All Members have the same objective, which is to introduce legislation to prevent other unfortunate tragedies in the area of water related leisure activities. The Bill is not an exercise in political point scoring.</P>

      <P>This issue has always been of concern to me. This may appear strange given that I am from County Laois which is the most inland county in Ireland. In my younger days, and it is still the case today, the only places children could swim were the River Nore, the River Barrow and their tributaries which can be dangerous. There are often currents and whirlpools. If people in the county want to go to the sea, they must travel up to 60 miles to it. My experience is limited to what happens on the banks of rivers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>An extraordinary item appeared in <i>The Sunday Times</i> on Sunday as a result of an investigation by the information commissioner. It is a full page article. The gentleman in the accompanying photograph without the dark glasses is the Taoiseach and the other gentleman is the head of this monitoring unit. The finding of the information commissioner shows that this unit, under the guise of operating as part of the GIS, is transparently for political purposes. I should remind the House that section 2 of the Freedom of Information Act classes as exempt from production under that Act the papers created for or held by Government Ministers and Ministers of State relating to party political activity. This is a reasonable exemption since the documents in question do not relate to the performance of official ministerial functions or Government business. Freedom of information legislation covers the public sector not private activity.</P>
      <P>This case, however, demonstrates the extent to which, under this Government, the distinction between official and party political activity has been blurred, if not entirely erased. Deputy Hogan and <i>The Sunday Times</i> applied under the Freedom of Information Act for access to correspondence between the manager of the Government's media monitoring unit and the Taoiseach. Both applicants were met with the extraordinary response, upheld on appeal by the information commissioner, that these records were exempt from production on the grounds that they relate to party political activity. The reality is that the media monitoring unit is a Fianna Fáil espionage unit funded by the taxpayer to monitor what its political opponents are saying about Fianna Fáil. It is Fianna Fáil's very own little GCHQ eavesdropping for political purposes on political opponents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unit is staffed by six full-time civil servants and headed by a former party press aide. The full year cost of the unit is £70,000, according to the <Col N="1369" /> Taoiseach, excluding the salaries of the six civil servants who are being used for party political purposes. While the unit masquerades as an integral part of the Government Information Service, supplying a service to members of the Government, its purpose, as revealed by the information commissioner, is transparently party political. The State pays for this as if it was a public service, such as the building of roads or the healing of the sick, yet according to the information commissioner, this is not a public service, it relates to the functions and activities of Ministers, not as Ministers but as members of a political party.</P>
    <P>Depending on your sense of insecurity you could regard this eavesdropping as either sinister or entirely pointless. That the taxpayer should subvent this exercise, however, when we have been authoritatively told that it is carried out entirely for party political purposes, raises serious questions about the legitimacy of this as an item of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>To give an example of the kind of thing revealed in the appeal to the information commissioner, the director of this press unit sent the Taoiseach a note with a clipping from the <i>News of the World</i> which says: &ldquo;Taoiseach, our old friends in the <i>News of the World</i> like you, I think! I would suggest that you might drop them a note and thank them for their support.&rdquo;. The <i>News of the World </i>is approving of a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach; Mr. de Valera would turn in his grave.</P>
    <P>The next note concerns a report that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, spoke for five minutes and 30 seconds on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and was interrupted nine times by the interviewer, Áine Lawlor. Anyone who interrupts the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, nine times in the course of five and a half minutes is a brave person. It seems we are getting to the stage that if David Hanley laughs during an interview, which he may do given the bags which was made of the Luas system by the Minister, it will be in a note from Mr. Marty Whelan to the Taoiseach. The report also stated that Deputy Emmet Stagg got five minutes and 45 seconds, largely uninterrupted.</P>
    <P>The notion that the taxpayer should have to pay for this party political unit is ridiculous. The rainbow coalition employed people for the express reason that our party political ethos and approach to policy questions were different. This is not about policy, it is about eavesdropping on what the media and telecommunications have to say about any given Minister. The notion that Marty Whelan is sitting in some secluded part of Government Buildings with a slide rule measuring the number of column inches the fashion correspondent in the <i>Sunday World</i> writes about the Taoiseach&mdash;</P>

It is an irony that he has ended up spying on the rest of us for Fianna Fáil but such are the ironies of progress in political life.</P>

      <P>The communications unit is designed to service all Government Ministers and to improve and expand the services provided by the Government Information Service. The unit provides a comprehensive information service to Government Ministers and their Departments on Government policy initiatives and developments and alerts them to any problems which may arise in relation to their implementation. In this way Departments will be able to provide a better service to the public.</P>
      <P>The communications unit works an 18 hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. Throughout the day the unit provides Ministers and their Departments with a detailed and comprehensive service, ensuring that Government Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments.</P>
      <P>The full year cost of the unit to the Department of the Taoiseach is approximately £72,000. This covers the manager's salary, shift allowances paid to staff and other general administrative costs. There are five members of staff seconded from other Departments whose salaries are paid by their parent Departments while the Department of the Taoiseach pays shift allowances amounting to one sixth of each officer's salary. The staff on secondment are not additional to overall Civil Service numbers and therefore there is no extra cost to the Exchequer for these staff. In a Dáil reply to Deputies Quinn and Bruton on 10 February, the Taoiseach mentioned a global figure for staff costs of £141,651. It is important to be precise here &ndash; this is the total cost to the Exchequer. I remind the Deputy, however, that the salaries of the staff on loan to the Department of the Taoiseach continue to be paid by their parent Departments. Therefore, the actual cost to the Department is only £72,000. Although these staff members have been loaned to the Department of the Taoiseach, they have not been replaced in their parent Departments and therefore this does not give rise to an increase in Civil Service numbers.</P>
      <P>The Department also pays some overhead costs such as office maintenance, heating and electricity costs. These costs cannot be identified separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the communications unit ensures that the costs are reduced across Government Departments. It is conservatively estimated that through the work of the communications unit, Government Departments have made savings of approximately £120,000 in the past year. There are further savings to the Exchequer as a result <Col N="1371" /> of the co-ordination role of the unit in providing information services to Departments and through the elimination of duplicate transcribing services.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Hogan and <i>The Sunday Times</i>, under the Freedom of Information Act, separately requested copies of all the correspondence, including memoranda, notes, letters etc., between the communications unit in the Department and the Taoiseach. The Department released 859 pages of records to Deputy Hogan and withheld 14 records. Subsequently the Department released a further three records, thereby withholding only 11 records.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the Department of the Taoiseach that these records contain opinions, assessments and advice prepared for the Taoiseach in his capacity as a member of a political party and come within the definition of exempt records as set out in section 2(1)(a) of the Freedom of Information Act which refers to: &ldquo;a record created for or held by an office holder and relates to the functions or activities of the office holder as a member of a political party&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the Information Commissioner, whom the Deputy will be aware is independent and impartial, on foot of a request from Deputy Phil Hogan and <i>The Sunday </i>Times newspaper seeking a review of the Department of the Taoiseach's decision to refuse access to these documents under the Freedom of Information Act, decided last week, under section 34(2) of the Freedom of Information Act, as follows:</P>
    <P>Having carried out a review of the decision of the Department of the Taoiseach and having considered the arguments put to me by the Department and the requesters, I am satisfied that records numbers 4 to 14 inclusive were created for the Taoiseach in his capacity as the head of a political party and the Department's claim that the records are exempt by virtue of section 2 is justified. Therefore I affirm the decisions of the Department of the Taoiseach of 14 August 1998 and 9 October 1998 to the extent that they relate to these records.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In reaching his decision, the Information Commissioner found as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have considered whether the fact that the record was created by someone paid out of public money is relevant in deciding whether the exemption in Section 2 applies. In my view it is one factor, but only one, which needs to be taken into account. It may suggest that the record was prepared for the office holder in his capacity as office holder. I think that such a suggestion must, however, be viewed against the very significant changes which have taken place in the legislation governing the appointment of civil servants. Section 19 of the Public Office Act, 1995 and section 11 of the Public Service Management <Col N="1372" /> Act, 1997 have now regulated the position of special Advisors to Ministers and Ministers of State. In performing their duties they are not excluded, as are civil servants, from providing advice to an office holder in his or her role as a member of the Oireachtas or a political party. The creator of the records under review is a special advisor to the Taoiseach. In making a judgment as to whether the records relate to the functions of or activities of the office holder as a member of a political party rather than as an office holder I must have regard to the contents of the records and, having done so, I am satisfied that they are exempt.</P>

        <b>: </b>This is an extremely serious case. It goes to the very heart of judicial performance, credibility and the public's faith in a central and vital instrument in the criminal justice system, namely, the courts.</P>
      <P>We are now in an era of freedom of information, transparency and accountability. We will not be deflected from our determination to find out the truth. Somebody somewhere in the pyramid of responsibility and accountability in the courts and judicial system made certain decisions in relation to the Philip Sheedy case. We must know who made these decisions, when they were made and why they were made. We are not interested in the usual bland ministerial script. This is an issue of sufficient gravity that unless a satisfactory explanation is forthcoming, we may have to seek to invoke Article 35.4.1 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mrs. Ann Ryan was a young mother of two children who was prematurely killed by a car which soared 60 feet into the air. She was killed and her husband was seriously injured in the presence and full view of their two children. The car, recklessly driven, had hit Glenview roundabout in Tallaght on 15 March 1997. The driver of the car was convicted of dangerous driving with excess alcohol at the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court in October 1997. The defendant was sentenced to four years in prison. Crucially, the presiding judge, Judge Mathews, gave the defendant leave to apply for a review of sentence two years later. One month later, however, in November <Col N="1373" /> 1997, the defendant applied to have the right of review set aside and thereby forfeited and abandoned his sentence review right.</P>
    <P>On 12 November 1998, just one year after sentence and 11 months before the original review date, Mr. Sheedy had the remaining three years of his sentence suspended by Judge Cyril Kelly at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court. Neither the Garda nor the Director of Public Prosecutions were notified or represented. The defendant was freed, resumed his job and 12 days later Judge Kelly was appointed to the High Court.</P>
    <P>In February of this year, the Director of Public Prosecutions challenged Judge Kelly's decision.</P>

        <b>: </b>I appreciate that. I will merely refer to the text of the case. Edward Comyn, Senior Counsel for the DPP, stated: &ldquo;How it came to be listed or why has not yet been satisfactorily discovered&rdquo;. He stated that no proper notice had been given to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Garda. The DPP contended that once the review date was removed, as it had been at Mr. Sheedy's request a month after sentencing, the four year sentence had to be served. No judge of equal rank to Judge Mathews could interfere with the decision.</P>
      <P>On Thursday last, the judicial review took place. There was no appearance on behalf of Judge Kelly. Counsel for the defendant withdrew the objection to the DPP's application to quash the sentence and the defendant surrendered himself at Mountjoy jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, established who gave the order for the wrongful listing of the case before Judge Kelly on 12 November 1998? As Minister he is responsible for the Garda. Has he established the reason the Garda were not notified so that they could have their views made known to the court? Has it been established why the Director of Public Prosecutions was not notified so that he could be represented at the court? Has the Minister established if the defendant, Mr. Sheedy, was present in court? Did the Minister become aware before 12 November 1998 that a sentence review was to take place or was he notified subsequent to the review? Was the Government aware, for example, of the review of the Sheedy case when it, on the recommendation of the Minister, promoted Judge Kelly to the High Court a mere 12 days after ordering the release of Mr. Sheedy? Were the views of the original presiding judge, Judge Mathews, sought at any stage? Is the fact <Col N="1374" /> that Judge Kelly would have had to have an affidavit presented on his behalf thereby explaining his actions the reason he was not represented in court last week?</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State are responsible for ensuring that court procedures are properly followed. In this case, a coach and four was driven through time-honoured procedures. We will not be fobbed off by excuses about judicial independence. This goes beyond judicial independence to the core of the credibility of the system.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Higgins in calling on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide a forthright explanation of the circumstances in which a man sentenced to four years imprisonment by one Circuit Court judge had his sentence reviewed and was released from prison, after serving just one year, by a different judge of that court.</P>
      <P>What happened in this case was at best peculiar and at worst sinister. After Mr. Sheedy had served only one year of a sentence, his case was relisted and appeared before Judge Cyril Kelly without any notice having been given to the Chief State Solicitor or the Director of Public Prosecutions. Despite the absence of a solicitor or counsel on behalf of the prosecution, Judge Kelly proceeded to review Mr. Sheedy's sentence and decided to suspend the remaining three years. Mr. Sheedy walked free from the court.</P>
      <P>It is an elementary principle of judicial practice that one judge will not interfere with a case which is, or properly ought to be, before a colleague of co-ordinate jurisdiction. It is also the most basic rule of natural justice that both sides must be heard in all cases &ndash;<i>audi alteram partem</i>.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that none of this would have come to light if a friend of the family of the victim, Ann Ryan, had not spotted Mr. Sheedy in the street and reported that fact to the family. They queried the early release with their local garda who contacted the office of the DPP. This was the first the director's office heard of Mr. Sheedy's release.</P>
      <P>In summary, three unusual things occurred. First, one judge took over the case of another without having been appointed as a substitute or successor. Second, an application was heard by the court without any notice having been given to the DPP. Third, a sentence was purportedly reviewed even though there was no provision before the court to allow for such a review.</P>
      <P>This case raises disturbing questions as to whether there was any improper interference with the administration of criminal justice by the courts. The DPP was so concerned at what happened that he quite rightly sought a judicial review of Judge Kelly's decision. However, the defendant withdrew his opposition to the DPP's application and presented himself to be readmitted to Mountjoy Jail. Therefore, there is a danger that we might not discover what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> The Minister must provide the House with answers to three questions. How did this case get to be re-listed for an inappropriate review of sentence without proper notice to the DPP and before the wrong judge? It is not open to the Minister to argue that this case is a matter for the courts for which he has no responsibility. The listing of cases before the courts is an administrative matter carried out by civil servants in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister is accountable to the House for the actions of his departmental staff and is obliged to answer questions as to their official activities. He must not seek to avoid giving answers. If he does not know the answers then he must investigate and report to the House.</P>
    <P>Some of the information concerning this case is readily available. To proceed with a judicial review of Judge Kelly's decision, the State authorities would have had to prepare and file grounding affidavits setting out the knowledge of various officials as to what happened and when and how. None of this information is confidential or secret. It would have been in open court last week if the DPP's judicial review had gone ahead.</P>
    <P>As a preliminary step I am calling on the Government, through the Attorney General, to request the DPP to provide a copy of the affidavits sworn in these proceedings if the Minister does not already have them. Those documents should be laid before the House. If they do not fully answer the questions I have raised then further inquiries are necessary.</P>
    <P>This case has caused great distress to the family of Ann Ryan who tragically died as a result of Mr. Sheedy's crime. There is an obligation on the Minister to provide clear answers as to what occurred in this case and to put the matter to rest once and for all.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the Minister's absence. He would be in the House to answer this question were he not in Belfast. On 20 October 1997 Mr. Philip Sheedy was convicted on charges of dangerous driving causing death and drink driving. He was sentenced on conviction before the Circuit Criminal Court to 4 years imprisonment and disqualified from driving for 12 years. The judge also ordered a review of the case for 20 October 1999. On 7 November 1997 the defence team returned to court and requested that the review ordered for 20 October 1999 be vacated. The judge granted this request. The case was re-entered on a judge's list in the Circuit Court for the 12 November 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is claimed the State did not have proper notice of this hearing. It is further claimed that, as a consequence, the State's opposition to the application before the court was not made known <Col N="1376" /> to the court and the judge in the circumstances decided that the prisoner should be released from custody.</P>
    <P>On 22 February 1999 the DPP obtained an order for judicial review in the High Court which took place on 25 March 1999. Following that hearing the judge made an order quashing the Circuit Court judge's order of 12 November 1998 and further ordered that Mr. Sheedy be held in prison on foot of the original Circuit Court judge's orders and warrant of 20 October 1997 and 7 November 1997. The end result was that Mr. Sheedy was recommitted to Mountjoy prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which the case came into the Circuit Court list for 12 November 1998, apparently without proper notice to the State, were naturally the subject of concern. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been conducting inquiries on this matter. In view of the very serious suggestions made concerning the circumstances of the hearing of this case, the House will agree that in fairness to all concerned, especially the bereaved family, the Minister should be allowed to complete his inquiries before any detailed statement is made.</P>
    <P>The questions asked in the House as to who gave the order to re-enter the case on the judge's list and the reasons the Garda and the DPP were not informed will be investigated. This case raises disturbing questions. The Minister expects to make a statement of his findings to the House in the near future in which he will give a forthright explanation, in so far as he can, of the circumstances surrounding this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's prepared reply will more than likely not deal with the particulars of this case concerning the need for a new Garda station in Ballinrobe. I raise this matter against the background of a number of break-ins and general vandalism in Ballinrobe in the past 12 months. In the last fortnight vandalism took place on church property &ndash; windows were smashed, a number of rooms were ransacked during the day in the local convent and there were break-ins to commercial premises during which money was stolen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> Ballinrobe is a good town which offers a good quality of life. The vast majority of its citizens, including young people, are law abiding, decent and committed. However, I regret that the wrong message is being sent out about Ballinrobe. I reject that message and call on the Minister of State to play his part in creating a better and safer future for the town, its families and the people in the area.</P>
    <P>Ballinrobe has needed a new Garda station for a long time. The current accommodation is a rented two-storey house. There are no parking facilities except on the street. A number of Garda and staff cars have been damaged. There is only one toilet and the kitchen has been infested with mice and rats for the past two years, despite the fact that Rentokil has been called in on a number of occasions. Garda strength is put at four sergeants and nine gardaí. Of these, one sergeant is based at Shrule, one is based in Kilmaine and one sergeant has been transferred to the traffic corps in Castlebar with his time extended to June this year. The remaining sergeant is the administrator of the Garda station in Ballinrobe. Two of the gardaí have been on sick leave, one for over 12 months and the other will be on sick leave for two years in May. Neither has been replaced. This is grossly unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is only one garda resident in the town. He is due to retire and will work his last day on Easter Monday. Garda Kelly has done an excellent job over the years but nothing has yet been heard of his replacement. I call on the Minister of State to expedite the provision of a new Garda station for Ballinrobe on the site of the old barracks on High Street, the chosen site for which plans have been prepared and visits made in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>I further call on the Minister to discuss with the Garda Commissioner flexibility in the pilot scheme introduced in the Claremorris and Thomastown areas about 15 years ago. This scheme means that security and Garda activity is centralised from one location. It is impossible to do it. Ballinrobe Garda station is open from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. each day. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Ballinrobe is strategically located between Castlebar and Galway. A considerable amount of traffic passes through the town and the station should be open on a 24-hour basis. The scheme is no longer valid given today's pace of activity. While it is a matter for the Commissioner, the Minister should encourage flexibility. Strategically located Garda stations should be open on a 24-hour basis.</P>
    <P>It should be a matter of course that gardaí appointed to stations should, in so far as possible, live in the area. This is a good town. Many facilities have been provided there by successive Governments and the practice of gardaí living in the locality should be encouraged. If there are to be strong communities which will work with each other and with the agencies of the State in the <Col N="1378" /> interests of security, job protection, young people and their futures, this should happen. Replacements for the gardaí who are sick and for Garda Kelly should be encouraged to reside in the town of Ballinrobe. The community would strongly support this.</P>
    <P>There are a number of small but well-known criminal elements in the general area of Ballinrobe. These have been responsible for a large number of break-ins and small, but serious, crimes. They should be apprehended and brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to speed up the provision of the Garda station in Ballinrobe which should be open on a 24-hour basis and to deal with the vandals who are giving the town and community a bad name. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Kenny. He outlined the Ballinrobe case extremely well. There is a problem with the opening hours of the Garda station and with the station itself. Ballinrobe is generally a law abiding town but crime has increased there in recent months. People are concerned, particularly the elderly. They worry about the opening hours of the Garda station and the manpower level.</P>
      <P>We will be told that this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. The current Minister spoke a great deal about zero tolerance before the last election. We are seeking ministerial tolerance on this occasion to ensure the money is provided for the new Garda station and that sufficient manpower is also provided. I also hope the Minister will talk to the Commissioner about the matter Deputy Kenny raised. It is a serious issue which concerns many people. Some are afraid to go to bed at night for fear of what might happen to them. This situation cannot continue.</P>
      <P>The Minister must deal with the manpower problem by replacing the people who are on sick leave and replacing the garda about to retire who currently lives in the town. I support the call for gardaí to live in the town and among the community. That way they know what is happening in an area. The Minister of State must also ask the Minister to ensure that money is provided for the construction of a new Garda station in Ballinrobe.</P>

In addition, the local convent was burgled recently and a sum of money was taken. This matter is still under investigation. I assure the Deputies that these matters are being pursued.</P>
      <P>Ballinrobe is an area headquarters in the rural policing scheme. The station party is operating at present from a rented building in the town. While the Minister accepts that this is not ideal, the accommodation is adequate in the short term. If the station party considers that there are minor maintenance issues which need attention, it should bring them to the attention of the Garda housing officer who will consider having them dealt with this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to build a new Garda station on <Col N="1380" /> the site of the old Garda station and married quarters, both of which are vacant at present. An official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda housing officer visited the area recently and have compiled a brief of requirements for the new station. This has been sent to the Office of Public Works which has been requested to produce a sketch scheme for the project.</P>
    <P>However, there are other projects ahead of Ballinrobe where contracts will be placed this year. Obviously, due to staff resources in the Office of Public Works and money available this year, it is not possible to progress this project immediately. The Deputies can be assured, nevertheless, that there will be no avoidable delay on the part of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in progressing this matter.</P>

      <QRef>[8105/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews): I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 62 together.</P>
    <P>Rwanda, one of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, is recovering from an officially-orchestrated genocide in 1994 which killed between 500,000 and 800,000 people. The ensuing conflict and chaos resulted in a massive displacement of people both internally and to neighbouring countries. The Irish Government and people responded very generously to the suffering of the Rwandan people and official and very practical expression was given to this outpouring of sympathy by three visits undertaken by the President to Rwanda.</P>
    <P>Following this immediate and much needed humanitarian assistance phase, the focus of our efforts, together with those of other members of the international community, is now on trying to establish the necessary conditions for peace, stability and development based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is in line with EU policy which supports the process undertaken by the Rwandan Government to recover from genocide, promote national reconciliation and reconstruction and transition to democracy. Important elements in this process are the strengthening of civil society and the rehabilitation of the institutions of government so that they are fair, inclusive and responsive to all sectors of this very divided society. The overall aim is to address the complex internal situation in Rwanda with a view to creating the necessary conditions for lasting stability at both national and regional level.</P>
    <P>Annual assistance levels for Rwanda are determined by needs on the ground and Irish aid funding priorities, the number and quality of projects received, the capacity of implementing partners on the ground, and the needs of the population as a whole. Irish assistance is targeted at the most vulnerable. Survival is a priority and our programme of assistance continues to focus, in the first instance, on meeting basic needs in the areas of shelter, food security and primary health care. However, Rwanda needs to be assisted to assume these and other tasks of government itself and Ireland, with other donors and the UN agencies, has provided assistance for clearly identified <Col N="1382" /> activities of the Rwandan Government in the areas of justice, housing and health.</P>
    <P>Assistance to the Rwandan Government in 1997 reflected the demands placed on it by the return of approximately 1.4 million Rwandan refugees from Tanzania and the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Grants were made to the Ministries of Family, Health, and Interior to support the resettlement and reintegration of the returnees, the construction of housing, the training of trauma counsellors and the extension of counselling services. There was not the same need for support of this kind in 1998.</P>
    <P>The bulk of Irish assistance is channelled through the Irish NGOs, Concern and Trócaire, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the UN Development Programme and UNICEF. A number of the international agencies contribute via the UNDP trust fund to Rwandan Government programmes and cooperate with them in rebuilding institutions and civil society. Given that we do not have resident representation in Rwanda, it makes administrative sense to work as much as possible through implementing agencies located there.</P>
    <P>Monitoring and assessment teams from the Department of Foreign Affairs travel at least twice yearly to Rwanda to monitor existing projects and assess future needs.  In addition, the chargé d'affaires in Uganda, who is accredited to Rwanda, visits Rwanda regularly.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to report to the House that the Special European Council, meeting in Berlin on 24-25 March, gave its approval to the proposed trade and co-operation agreement with South Africa. The European Council instructed the Council of Ministers, as a matter of urgency, to take the necessary measures to secure its formal adoption. The way is now clear, after more than four years of negotiation, for the conclusion of this important agreement between South Africa, on one side, and the member states of the European Community and the European Commission, on the other.</P>
      <P>The European Council rightly described the agreement as historic and a further step in the consolidation and strengthening of the solid partnership which exists between the European Union and South Africa in the political, economic and trade fields. The agreement is considered by the European Council as a symbol of the strong links of friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Europe and southern Africa. The decision of the European Council brings to a successful conclusion the protracted and often very difficult negotiations between the EU and South Africa on this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> I place on the record of the House my appreciation for the unstinting efforts of all participants in the negotiating process, including the German Presidency, the Commission and the South African authorities. It is particularly gratifying that the European Council reached its decision while President Mandela was still in office.</P>
    <P>I consider the agreement to be a reasonable and balanced compromise and one which will bring benefits to both sides. Ireland has consistently supported the conclusion of a generous agreement with South Africa and I have no doubt this agreement will respond to South Africa's special circumstances and make a significant contribution to its efforts to overcome the inherited burden of the apartheid era.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The position of the Government remains that set out in my reply of 17 February to another question &ndash; we wish to see an end to the US embargo imposed against Cuba. We are working to that end in concert with our European Union partners and have consistently supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for an end to the embargo.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the EU common position on Cuba, adopted in December 1996, our aim is to encourage a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict in Cuba or mass emigration from there. The common position also makes clear that wholehearted co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent absence of fundamental human and political rights in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Pope's visit to Cuba in January 1998 there had been a certain easing of repressive measures against political dissidents and a reduction in the number of political prisoners. However, recently the situation has deteriorated again. In January the criminal law was amended to introduce new and even harsher legislation aimed at curbing dissidence. Earlier this month, four members of the Internal Dissidence Group were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. In a statement issued on 17 March, the EU expressed <Col N="1384" /> its deep regret at the sentences passed. It pointed out that the people convicted had exercised a freedom of expression which is recognised universally as a human right and that the EU could not accept that citizens exercising such a right should be criminalised by State authorities. The EU also rejected judicial proceedings of a political nature and expressed deep concern about amendments to the criminal law further curtailing the exercise of the rights of citizens. At the same time, the EU reiterated the continuing objective in its relations with Cuba, namely to encourage a transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as set out in the common position.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported a number of resolutions on human rights in Cuba at the UN Commission on Human Rights. At the current session, we will work with our partners on this issue, taking account of the recent negative developments, and we will once again call on Cuba to co-operate with all the human rights mechanisms of the UN.</P>
    <P>In short, Cuba must play its part if it wishes to make progress in its international relations. We look to the Cuban authorities for an improvement in the human rights situation.</P>
    <P>I am at present reviewing the extent of our diplomatic relations with Latin America and the Caribbean generally. The question of diplomatic relations with Cuba will be examined in that context.</P>

As I pointed out in my earlier reply, the issue of the duty free is a taxation matter which falls, in the first instance, within the remit of the ECOFIN Council and, therefore, of my colleague the Minister for Finance. Also, as I pointed out previously, the Department of Foreign Affairs, through its embassies in the capitals of other member states, and the Permanent Representation to the European Union, has availed of appropriate opportunities to advance the case for a reexamination of the decision to abolish duty free. Several of our embassies have also been involved in assisting and facilitating industry representatives in establishing contacts in other member states.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 25 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to the reply I have already given to Question No. 5 from Deputy Mitchell.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy De Rossa's question, in which he inquires whether there have been any contacts between my Department and NATO regarding Partnership for Peace, it was made clear to the Dáil, by the Deputy's current party colleague and then Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, when the Deputy was in Government, that senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Defence had consultations with NATO on 20 June 1996 to explore further the benefits which Ireland could derive from PfP. I understand that these consultations were entirely satisfactory to the then Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and confirmed his understanding that each participating state can determine the terms and scope of its contribution; that participation would have no implications for the policy of military neutrality; and that PfP had proven itself to be a key forum for peacekeeping co-operation. The reference is at Volume 478, No. 5, Column 914 of Dáil Debates for 30 April 1997. Officials of my Department have periodic contact with the NATO secretariat on peacekeeping issues, principally arising from Irish participation in the Bosnia Stabilisation Force (SFOR).</P>

      <P>The important matter of EU-USA trade relations is a high priority of the General Affairs Council, <Col N="1386" /> which reviews developments in this field on a regular basis. Together with the Commission, which represents the European Union in trade talks with the USA, the Council has been considering how actual or potential differences between the EU and the USA can be prevented from escalating into contentious trade disputes. In my view, the way forward is through intensive consultations between the Commission and the relevant US authorities, in this instance the Office of the US Trade Representative. We believe those consultations should aim to reach agreement on an effective early warning system which would reduce, and ideally eliminate, the serious risks to trade posed by these disputes. The current dispute over bananas is currently before the World Trade Organisation and decisions by that body on the appropriateness of US trade sanctions, and on the compatibility of the EU banana regime with WTO rules, is expected on or around 12 April.</P>
      <P>On 3 March the USTR announced its intention to impose punitive 100 per cent tariffs on a list of selected EU products unless the EU amended its banana import regime in a manner acceptable to the USA. The effect of that announcement was to require US importers of those products to post bonds to cover the amount of the threatened duties. The bonds would be called in only if and when the WTO ruled in favour of the USA. The better course would have been for the USA to await the decision of the WTO before determining its position. In common with our EU partners, we are firmly opposed to unilateral action by any member state of the WTO. The EU is committed to working within existing WTO structures and procedures. The impact of the USTR decision on overall EU trade could amount to approximately $500 million. The total value of targeted Irish exports is of the order of £2 million.</P>
      <P>The Government's concerns about the USTR decision of 3 March have been taken up directly with the US authorities, at ministerial and senior official levels, and the USA is fully aware of our views on this dispute. We will, as circumstances warrant, continue to raise our concerns with the USA. The General Affairs Council will keep this matter under careful review, in close consultation with the Commission.</P>
      <P>Other questions on the EU-USA bananas dispute were replied to in the House, in writing, on 9 and 16 February and on 24 March 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the results of the latest round of tripartite talks which have taken place in New York under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General. We seem, at last, to be close to the point where the East Timorese people may be able to exercise freely their right to self-determination and I welcome therefore the progress that has been made at the diplomatic level.</P>
      <P>At the same time, difficulties remain. It is reported that Indonesia will not accept a straightforward referendum process for consulting the East Timorese people because of the implications which this would have for ethnic minorities elsewhere who might wish to secede. Another difficulty arises from the presence of a pro-government militia force in East Timor which appears to have been provided with large amounts of weaponry by the Indonesian army. As a result of the activities of this militia, the risk of widespread communal violence is believed to have increased in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>I urge tolerance and restraint by all sides as the best means of ensuring the people of East Timor can look forward to a peaceful and harmonious future. In this respect, I believe that the release from house arrest of the resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, and the establishment of a UN presence in Dili would contribute greatly to advancing the current peace process. I also believe that the informal militia groups which have been set up in East Timor should be disarmed. In this context, the UN Security Council may wish to consider the deployment of a peacekeeping force if the necessary conditions for this, including the agreement of the Indonesian authorities, can be met.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that I am planning to make a short visit myself to Jakarta and East Timor in the middle of next month. While there I hope to have the opportunity to express my solidarity with those who suffered oppression for so long and to impress upon everyone I meet the necessity of avoiding violence at all costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 18, 24 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The situation on the Garvaghy Road remains very serious. The Government has closely monitored events there since last July when the main stand-off by Orangemen at Drumcree ended as a result of the tragic deaths of the three young Quinn brothers. The maintenance of an Orange protest at Drumcree has sustained tensions between the Garvaghy Road residents and loyalist elements in Portadown. The Orangemen of Portadown, occasionally augmented by Orange delegations from other areas in Northern Ireland, have continually rallied and marched in support of the vigil at Drumcree church. These rallies and marches have been accompanied by a series of attacks by loyalist elements on the RUC and on the residents. An RUC officer has died as a result of injuries received in the course of these attacks. They have, moreover, contributed to an air of menace and tension on the Garvaghy Road.</P>
      <P>Despite the tensions, the residents of the Garvaghy Road have continued to engage in the search for agreement and accommodation. While they have consistently called on the Orange Order to meet them in direct face-to-face talks, they have also accepted a series of proximity talks. The most recent of these occurred last December and ended without a resolution. However, arising from an assessment of the nature of these talks, the British Government proposed that an experienced mediator from Scotland, Mr. Frank Blair, explore with both sides how best to proceed. These discussions are currently ongoing.</P>
      <P>Throughout all these talks and at virtually all their meetings with political leaders, the representatives of the Garvaghy Road were accompanied by Ms Rosemary Nelson. She acted as their legal advisor. Deeply humanitarian and fundamentally committed to the rule of law, Ms Nelson brought to the Garvaghy delegation both legal expertise and her own inimitable human qualities. Much has been said about her and her work, with all of which I strongly agree. She will be sadly missed by all the residents of the Garvaghy Road and in particular by their representatives with whom she worked so closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> Her murder has added a new and emotional dimension to the issue of the Drumcree march. The suspicion among nationalists of collusion between loyalists and members of the security forces in her death, and also their concern about the Robert Hamill case, have exacerbated tensions. Despite this, we must continue to pursue actively such an accommodation. I have regularly discussed the situation on the Garvaghy Road with the Secretary of State and we have both recently reiterated our view that progress can only be made by a process of dialogue and local accommodation. The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have also both been personally involved in encouraging this process. The Taoiseach met recently with Breandán McCionnaith and Joe Duffy to discuss the situation on the ground and to explore ways of moving forward.</P>
    <P>Apart from ministerial-level meetings, the situation on the ground is regularly discussed between the Irish and British sides within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. We have continually encouraged the British authorities to vigorously uphold the rule of law and to manage public order situations with the objective of minimising the impact on the Garvaghy Road community. It is absolutely vital that the rule of law, including the determinations of the Parades Commission, prevail and be seen to prevail on the Garvaghy Road in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>We have raised, through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the question of the number of parades sanctioned by the Parades Commission and have been informed by the British authorities that the Parades Commission can neither sanction nor ban parades. It should be noted that the power to ban a parade resides with the Secretary of State. The Parades Commission can impose conditions and restrictions on the organisers of a parade, including re-routing. In this context, of the 128 parades notified to take place in Portadown from March 1998 to 26 March 1999, the commission imposed conditions on 48 of these parades, 38 of which related to the continuing weekly protests by the Portadown District LOL No. 1. Regarding the number of prosecutions resulting from participation in illegal parades, we understand that this information is currently being compiled on the British side and I will advise Deputy Keaveney on receipt of it.</P>
    <P>I assure the house that the Government continue to monitor the situation in Portadown closely and maintain its contacts with those directly involved. As we approach the height of the marching season in July, these contacts will intensify, as will our discussions with the British Government. The Government remain committed to a resolution of this crucial &ndash;  and at times tragic  &ndash; issue, based on mutual respect, dialogue, agreement and the rule of law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>As regards the current state of the Middle East peace process, it is regrettable that almost five months after the signing of the Wye River Memorandum by the Israelis and Palestinians, there is no evidence of any progress in the process. The current deadlock results from the decision last December by the Israeli Government to suspend implementation of the Wye River Memorandum, an agreement which they had signed barely two months earlier. Thus, while by now we could have expected to see many aspects of the Wye River Memorandum in place &ndash; and to have the region reap the benefit of the agreement &ndash; little has been achieved in real terms.</P>
      <P>As the European Union stated in Berlin last week, we remain concerned at the current deadlock. We call upon the parties to implement fully and immediately the Wye River Memorandum. All sides should desist from any activity contrary to international law, including all settlement activity, and should fight incitement and violence.</P>
      <P>Realistically, however, there is now little prospect of any further progress until after the Israeli elections, scheduled for 17 May, and the consequent separate election to the Office of Israeli Prime Minister and the formation of a new government, perhaps in early June. The situation in the region has been further complicated by the recent upsurge in fighting in south Lebanon. As a result, the Israeli involvement in Lebanon has become a domestic election issue in Israel.</P>
      <P>Against this background, attention is focused on President Arafat's stated intention to declare an independent Palestinian state on 4 May. This date marks the end of a five-year transition period set down in the Oslo Accord for negotiating a permanent settlement. In that period what are known as final status issues should be addressed. These were identified in the Oslo Accord as, <i>inter alia</i>, the status of Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees and the nature of the entity in which the Palestinians will find themselves when negotiations conclude. There is concern that the proposed declaration on 4 May by President Arafat could exacerbate tensions in the run-up to the Israeli elections and prove counter-productive for the Palestinians themselves. There have, however, been indications that the Palestinians would postpone the 4 May deadline if adequate reassurances were provided in relation to the future recognition of a Palestinian state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> At the European Council last week in Berlin, the European Union reaffirmed the continuing and unqualified Palestinian right to self-determination including the option of a state and looks forward to the early fulfilment of this right &ndash; a right which is not subject to veto. The European Council, which declared its readiness to consider the recognition of a Palestinian state in due course, also urged the parties to agree on an extension of the transitional period established by the Oslo Accord and stated that it should be possible to conclude negotiations within a target period of one year. The Union is convinced that the creation of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of existing agreements and through negotiations would be the best guarantee of Israel's security and Israel's acceptance as an equal partner in the region.</P>
    <P>In the course of his visit to the region in January, the Taoiseach made clear to President Arafat that Ireland has always taken a sympathetic position on the issue of Palestinian statehood. We are supportive of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in the context of a negotiated settlement. We have looked for that right to be exercised fully and we have acknowledged that one of the outcomes of the peace process could be an independent Palestinian state. For the sake of stability and security in the region, this would have to be achieved in the best possible conditions and at the best possible time.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> I welcome the statement made last night announcing the location of the whereabouts of the graves of nine of the disappeared. Over the past number of years, my colleagues in Government and I have regularly raised the issue of the disappeared in discussions with Sinn Féin and other parties. Together with all those who are working towards the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I welcome this confidence-building measure. I believe that the progress which is being made in this regard should rightly be viewed as a constructive development in keeping with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement. The families of the disappeared have suffered for years because the bodies of their loved ones have not been returned to them and I hope that this may bring a sense of closure, in order to end their anguish and pain. There are, however, still missing persons on both sides of the community and I again call on all those who have any information which might lead to the identification of their whereabouts to come forward at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

The two sides also agreed to meet again at an unspecified date, preferably within Afghanistan. The fact that the talks took place was clearly a positive development. Sources within the United Nations have, however, cautioned against excessive optimism. It would appear there remains a long path to be followed before any genuine settlement can be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is extremely concerned about the continuing crisis in the Great Lakes Region of Africa, particularly the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The incremental progress which had been made, with strong support from Ireland and other international donors, towards putting aside the legacy of the 1994 ethnic violence and genocide is under renewed threat.</P>
      <P>The conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo is having a severe impact on the civilian population through displacement, hunger and continued killings and other human rights violations. It also has grave regional implications due to the involvement of neighbouring States who are providing military support to the protagonists. The priority of the Government, our EU partners and other members of the international community is to bring about a freezing of the current conflict with an immediate cease-fire as a precursor to a negotiated settlement. This should include agreed mechanisms for the withdrawal of outside military interests and for monitoring the peace to the satisfaction of all parties. The UN Secretary General has asked the UN Security Council to prepare for a possible international presence to support a peaceful settlement. Within the Democratic Republic of Congo it will be necessary to establish an all-inclusive political dialogue so that meaningful democratic transition can take place with full regard for human rights and the rule of law. At the same time, the security and ethnic concerns of neighbouring countries will have to met. The Government strongly supports the ongoing regional peace efforts of President Chiluba of Zambia, who recently met President Kabila in Ndola, and other members of the Southern African Development Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early this month, the EU Special Envoy, Mr. <Col N="1394" /> Ajello completed a mission to Burundi in support of the Arusha peace talks which are being facilitated by former President Nyerere of Tanzania and in support of which Ireland has provided and funded one working expert. The fourth round of the current talks took place in Arusha in January and was followed by the lifting of regional economic sanctions which had been imposed on Burundi in 1996. Meetings of the thematic committees, which are a further element of the Arusha talks process, were held on 8 to 16 March. The EU has noted the stated resolve of the Government of Burundi to bring the current negotiations to a successful conclusion in 1999 and has encouraged all parties to contribute constructively to this goal. The Union and individual partners, including Ireland, will continue to support the Arusha peace process both politically and through our substantial technical and financial contributions. We have also called on both sides to end their acts of violence against the civilian population immediately. At this months 55th Session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the Government will urge the Burundi authorities to respond to the concerns of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burundi.</P>
    <P>The EU regularly reviews developments in Rwanda under the relevant provisions of its common position adopted in March 1998. This evaluation at present includes the development of civil society, the review of new democratic structures at local level, preparations for local elections, judicial and human rights reform, the processing of the thousands in detention since the 1994 genocide and the impact on Rwanda of the conflict in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. In addition, there are security problems in the north-west of the country due to attacks by guerilla groups. Responses by the security forces have been criticised for their excessive impact on the innocent civilian population. The EU Special Envoy, Mr. Ajello is actively working to create the necessary conditions, at both national and regional level, for lasting stability in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to support efforts aimed at bringing about lasting peace and stability in the Great Lakes Region and at normalising the lives of its vulnerable people. The EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, Mr. Aldo Ajello, is actively pursuing these objectives on the Unions behalf through his direct contacts with the UN, the Organisation of African Unity, regional leaders and other key figures. The EU continues to support the holding, at an appropriate time, of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes Region as a means of ensuring lasting stability in the region.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The plight of those from both communities who have been sent into forced exile because of paramilitary intimidation is a matter of grave concern. It is clearly a breach of the law and, more fundamentally, of their basic human rights. The Government supports the wish of these individuals to have the threats against them lifted and believes that they should be allowed to return home safely. This matter should be addressed and resolved urgently.</P>
      <P>The Government has at all times, in their contacts with parties associated with paramilitary groups, emphasised the need to adhere to the principles of non-violence and democracy as enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. Involvement in any form of intimidation or breaches of human rights is simply incompatible with the terms and spirit of the Agreement. Given the secretive nature of the threatening behaviour involved, statistics on the subject are difficult to compile. I have, however, had inquiries made with the British authorities and if any information becomes available I will communicate with Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>I again urge all those with influence in this area to help put an immediate end to the enforced exile of these individuals. In the new context created by the Good Friday Agreement, society should be freed of this totally unacceptable practice.</P>

      <P>The Government and our EU partners are actively supporting efforts aimed at restoring <Col N="1396" /> peace and stability in Sierra Leone. We are also seeking to provide appropriate humanitarian assistance to the innocent civilian population who have fallen victim to the excesses of the current conflict with thousands of fatalities. We strongly condemn the atrocities, gratuitous mutilations and other human rights abuses which have taken place. We particularly deplore the abduction and exploitation of children by the rebel side and call for their immediate release and return to their families. These human rights concerns are being taken up by the Government and other members of the international community at the current session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the recent decision by the UN Security Council to extend the mandate of the UN Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) for a further three months until 13 June. We also strongly support the ongoing efforts of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Francis G. Okelo, who is actively seeking to create the conditions necessary for the opening of a political dialogue between the Government of President Kabbah and the rebel side. At present, rebel forces hold much of the country outside Freetown which is controlled by the Government with the support of Nigerian-led ECOMOG forces.</P>
      <P>President Eyadema of Togo, who is Chair of the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has offered to host talks between the Freetown authorities and Mr. Foday Sankoh, leader of the Revolutionary United Front. President Kabbah has publicly stated his Government's openness to peace talks and the possibility that he may grant a pardon to Mr. Sankoh when dealt with by the courts. Mr. Sankoh, who is being held in Freetown on charges arising from his involvement in a previous coup attempt, has been granted radio access to his field commanders to prepare for a possible dialogue. More recently, it has been reported that Sankoh has used this access to order his field commanders not to make a further attack on Freetown. There are also conflicting reports of an imminent rebel offensive. However, it is hoped that the recent and more constructive engagement between the conflicting parties will help prevent a return to all-out conflict. President-elect Obasanjo of Nigeria has confirmed that his Government will continue to play a leading role in the regionally deployed ECOMOG monitoring force in order to support ongoing peace efforts.</P>
      <P>Along with our EU and UN partners, the Government will continue to support diplomatic efforts at a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Sierra Leone. We will also continue to provide appropriate humanitarian relief to the vulnerable civilian population and seek to prevent any further interference in the conflict by outside interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, along with most of its donor partners, is committed to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for Official Development Assistance (ODA) and to reaching an interim target in the lifetime of this Government of 0.45 per cent of GNP. The progress being made in developing our aid programme in recent years and in moving towards these targets is significant. For example, on the basis of the most up-to-date calculation available, ODA in 1999 will amount to £158 million. This is the largest allocation since our aid programme began 25 years ago this year.</P>
      <P>Our best estimate for ODA is that it will reach £172 million in the year 2000 and £195 million in 2001. The figure for 1998 was £137 million. Only seven years ago, in 1992, ODA was a mere £40 million. There has, therefore, been a four-fold increase in ODA in that seven year period. No other donor country has such a rate of increase in the period. Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the increase in the period was from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the main factor in the increase in ODA this year and in the next two years is the Governments agreement to planned increases in Vote 39 in the period 1999 to 2001. This commitment is without precedent in our programme. It provides the single biggest set of increases in the history of Irish aid and it allows for the first time for multi-annual budgeting for long-term, sustainable development programmes in our priority countries, which are among the poorest in the world. This applies also to what we provide to deal with man-made and natural emergencies, for our voluntary contributions to UN and other multilateral aid agencies, for the Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO) and for our assistance through NGOs. Importantly too, these increases are in addition to the package announced some months ago for debt relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been agreed is that the aid allocation administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs will amount to £400 million in the period 1999 to 2001. Specifically, the aid subheads of Vote 39, the Vote for International Co-operation, subheads C to G inclusive, will amount to £104.374 million in 1999, £136.400 million in 2000 and £159.200 in 2001, an increase next year of <Col N="1398" /> over 30 per cent and an increase of 17 per cent the following year. This will be in addition to contributions by other Departments to multilateral institutions such as the Global Environment Facility or those under the Food Aid Convention of the World Food Programme. This agreement underpins the growth of the aid programme and marks further increments towards the interim target of 0.45 per cent of GNP and the ultimate goal set by the UN of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>I remain very concerned at the situation in Algeria. While the incidence of atrocities is now decreasing somewhat, conflict is continuing between the security forces and militant opponents of the regime with a resulting serious loss of life among civilians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best way of securing an end to the conflict is the rapid development of a democratic and pluralist Algeria, based on the rule of law, with an accountable government ruling in an open and transparent manner. I am hopeful that the Presidential election campaign, which is under way, <Col N="1399" /> will pave the way for further reform. While the process is not flawless &ndash; not all political parties are free to take part &ndash; the campaign is relatively open with no less than five candidates. It is generally accepted that they reflect a broad range of political opinion.</P>
    <P>A second way of assisting the democratic elements in Algerian society is through increased contact with the outside world. I am glad to note in this context the visit of members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, who visited Algeria from 22 to 24 February and met representatives of various Algerian political parties. I am confident these discussions were to the mutual benefit of both sides.</P>
    <P>On the international level I regret to note the Algerian Government is still refusing to allow UN rapporteurs on human rights issues to visit the country. This non-co-operation with UN human rights machinery has been strongly criticised. I will ensure that the European Union will expressly address this point, and our deep concern over reports of involuntary disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture of detainees, during the current session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
    <P>On a bilateral level, Ireland has continued to raise the questions of human rights, including torture and disappearances, directly with the Algerian authorities and has called on them to address and remedy these violations. I will continue to take an active interest in the matter of human rights in Algeria.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the Western Europe and Others Group of States for the two-year term 2001-2002. The election will take place in the 185-member UN General Assembly in the autumn of 2000, probably in October. The election is being contested by three other candidates, Norway and Turkey, and since 5 March, Italy. Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of those states present <Col N="1400" /> and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 120 states will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have sought support for Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions, including on official visits abroad. Since September last, I have personally discussed Ireland's candidacy with representatives of over 40 United Nations' member states.</P>
    <P>In September, before the campaign entered a more intense phase, we had around 30 commitments. This level of support has been built on and I am determined that by September-October 2000 when the election takes place we will have the necessary number of votes to secure election. As I have indicated previously, as this is a contested election, I am reluctant to indicate the exact level of support committed to Ireland at this stage.</P>
    <P>As regards UN reform, in line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, Ireland has actively supported efforts to modernise and reform the UN system so that it can be more effective in responding to the complex and difficult challenges in the coming millennium. Our priority is to secure agreement on the measures necessary to revitalise the United Nations and to ensure more vigorous action in fulfilling its mandate under the UN Charter of maintaining international peace and security and promoting the economic and social development of all member states. With our EU partners, we have given strong support to measures aimed at securing a better co-ordinated and more streamlined UN, which makes more effective use of personnel and financial resources, and at improving the setting of priorities for action by the UN.</P>
    <P>Ireland takes an active role in ongoing discussions in New York on Security Council reform and, as a member of an informal group of ten small and medium-sized states, has played a significant bridge-building role in the debate. Ireland supports a reform of the composition of the Security Council which would make it more representative of the general membership of the UN. We favour a small increase in permanent members, from its present number of five, selected on the basis of global influence and contribution to the work of the UN as well as considerations of equitable geographical distribution. We also favour a small increase in the number of non-permanent members of around five, with these new seats being allocated to the various regional groups. In addition to the enlargement issue, Ireland favours improved and more transparent working methods of the Council involving more frequent consultation between it and the General Assembly, the Secretary-General and other major organs of the UN system. We also see a need for more restrictive use of the veto power of the permanent members of the Security Council and we believe that the veto power should not be extended to any new permanent members.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>It was agreed on 18 December last that a publicly-owned limited company will be established to carry out overseas marketing and promotion activity for Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, as one of the six areas for North-South co-operation.</P>
      <P>The company will not operate as an Implementation Body as such, but will nonetheless play a major role in a key area of North-South co-operation.</P>
      <P>The relevant line Departments, North and South, are in discussion on issues relating to the establishment of such a company and the intention is that arrangements would be approved at an early meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council. Deputies will no doubt appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any aspect of these pending their finalisation and agreement.</P>

      <P>I had a very useful meeting with Dr. Sein Win in my office on 23 March. Dr. Sein Win was accompanied at this meeting by his representative in Brussels and by two members of Burma Action Ireland whose efforts in this country to promote the cause of democracy in Burma in recent years have been most commendable.</P>
      <P>I expressed concern about the human rights situation in Burma, and in particular the harassment to which the leader of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, was being subjected and the difficulties that were put in the way of a visit to her in Rangoon in recent months by her husband, despite international appeals to the Burmese authorities to show compassion.</P>
      <P>I was happy to confirm to Dr. Sein Win that the Government remained committed to support for the democratic movement in Burma. I told him I would work to ensure that the EU common position on Burma would be upheld and strengthened &ndash; even if that involved the cancellation of next week's planned EU-ASEAN Ministerial meeting in Berlin. I also indicated we would support strongly-worded resolutions on Burma at the United Nations in New York and at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Sein Win thanked the Government for its support of the Burmese cause. He expressed the belief that the ASEAN countries would change <Col N="1403" /> their attitude towards the Burma problem provided that the international community continued to maintain its current tough stance on the issue. He also made a special plea for the Burmese refugees in Thailand, seeking international support for them to ensure that none would be repatriated against their will.</P>
    <P>In addition, we had an opportunity to discuss the provision of assistance for the democratic movement in Burma. The question of scholarships for Burmese students and the possible holding of a meeting in Ireland of the Burmese Cabinet-in-exile were raised.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to express my sincere condolences to Aung San Suu Kyi on the unfortunate death of her husband, Michael Aris, which occurred last Saturday.</P>

      <P>On 22 and 23 March I received information from two sources that the Irish Christian Brother, Noel Bradshaw, was being held in the Makeni area, that he was safe but that he was being guarded and that his freedom to move about was restricted.</P>
      <P>We have alerted and are in contact with the Sierra Leone, British, Italian and Holy See authorities as well as with the Economic Community of West Africa Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), the UN Secretary-Generals Special Representative and the UN Observer Mission in Sierra Leone. All of them have been asked for assistance in locating Brother Bradshaw and ensuring his release. It is very difficult to get reliable information. Despite a report that members of the Revolutionary United Front told an Italian television crew on 12 March that Brother Bradshaw and two priests abducted along with him would soon be set free, there is yet no sign of that.</P>
      <P>We will continue our efforts to get more definite information and to secure the release of Brother Bradshaw.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The murder of Rosemary Nelson was a shocking act of violence. It shocked all those for whom she worked. They have lost a professional adviser and someone who, despite threats against her, gave them her support where others might have hesitated. It shocked the legal and human rights community who saw a courageous advocate of the law and of human rights cut down in a most blatant act of murder. It shocked the public at large that a mother of three should be so callously targeted and done to death. I wish to reiterate my own personal horror and condemnation of this brutal act. At this tragic time, our prayers and thoughts go to her husband Paul and their three young children.</P>
      <P>Rosemary Nelson believed in making progress through the law and on the basis of human rights and dignity for all. Her commitment to law and justice was constantly affronted by the indignity suffered by those denied the protection of the law and the comfort of justice. She embodied peace and justice in her career and in her commitment to the ideals of the law. The bomb that killed her was assuredly meant to damage too all that she stood for.</P>
      <P>A number of reports, including those by the Independent Commission on Police Complaints and the United National Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Param Cumarswamy, have added to and strengthened the concern amongst very many nationalists about the ability of the RUC to conduct an investigation into the death of Ms Nelson. The Government has had on-going discussions with the British authorities on all aspects of this case, and will continue to maintain the closest contact with them. The widespread concerns which have been expressed by human rights groups, including in relation to the investigation process, have been emphasised in all these contacts, including at a meeting between the Taoiseach and PM Blair on 23 March.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Chief Constable of the RUC has now invited the Chief Constable of Kent, Mr. David Phillips, with the assistance of the FBI, to head the investigation into the murder. On 17 March the British Prime Minister said in the House of Commons that the Phillips investigation would be independent and that its remit would be very wide. On 29 March 1999 it was announced that the Deputy Chief Constable of Norfolk, Mr. Colin Port, is to assume responsibility for the day-to-day control, direction and command of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> The deep concern of the Government about this case will continue to be pursued vigorously. It is absolutely essential that the investigation should not just be independent and transparent but be fully seen to be such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is totally opposed to the use of the death penalty. We will use every suitable opportunity to press for its abolition.</P>
      <P>With regard to the use of capital punishment in the United States, I would refer the Deputy to my statement in the Seanad on 17 February last, in which I expressed my deep regret at the executions which continue to take place there. I also noted that it was the deeply held view of the Irish Government, and that of the other member states of the European Union, that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, I informed the Seanad that common guidelines for EU initiatives on the issue of the death penalty had been agreed and adopted by EU Foreign Ministers in June 1998. These guidelines state that, where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has been agreed that, where individual cases violate basic minimum standards, the European Union will consider making a specific intervention. It is our strong belief that an EU intervention carries greater force than individual bilateral approaches by national Governments.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption of these guidelines, the Union's efforts have continued to focus on promoting universal abolition of the death penalty. On behalf of all member states, the EU Presidency has issued démarches on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries. Over the last year, the EU has intervened in the following death-row cases in the United States: Joseph Cannon in Texas, Robert Carter in Texas, Dwayne Allen Wright in Virginia, Mummia Abu Jamal in Pennsylvania, Karl and Walter Lagrand (both German nationals) in Arizona and, most recently, Sean Sellars in Oklahoma.</P>
      <P>In relation to the situation in Massachusetts, we understand that the proposals of Governor Cellucci to re-introduce the death penalty in that State are due to be voted on this week. We will await the outcome of this vote and, in the event that capital punishment is re-introduced, we will consider appropriate action in consultation with our EU partners.      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> The 55th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which is currently taking place in Geneva, provides us with an opportunity to further the international campaign for the abolition of capital punishment. At the last two sessions of the Commission, Ireland strongly supported the resolution on the question of the death penalty, which had been tabled by Italy, and we campaigned actively for its adoption. This year, the European Union will introduce the draft resolution on the death penalty and Ireland will work with its EU partners to ensure maximum support and co-sponsorship for this resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 46, 56, 97 and 98 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> Ireland views the burden of indebtedness borne by many developing countries as an enormous constraint on their economic and social development and as one of the greatest challenges facing the international community.</P>
    <P>The Government has consistently used the relevant international fora to advocate the need for a comprehensive resolution to the debt problem of the developing countries, and in particular of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries, in the interests of their economic and social development.</P>
    <P>In a new initiative announced last September, the Minister for Finance and I launched a major package of assistance to alleviate debt and assist the process of economic and social reform in the most heavily indebted poor countries in the world. This package will comprise a total of £31.5 million, of which £9.5 million has already been committed to debt relief in two of Irish aid priority countries, Mozambique and Tanzania. An additional £15 million will be provided for multilateral debt relief under the joint World Bank/IMF Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative, while the remaining £7 million will be provided to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) of the International Monetary Fund. The Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill 1998, which will give effect to those payments, passed all Stages in the Seanad on 26 March 1999.</P>
    <P>This initiative, which represents a very substantial contribution towards alleviating the burden of indebtedness in developing countries, will enable Ireland to continue to play a strong and vigorous role in international action to tackle the debt problem.</P>
    <P>The Government, in agreeing the debt relief package, also adopted a set of fundamental principles which will inform our future national policy on debt. These principles take account of the representations which the Minister for Finance and I received from non-governmental organisations in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>As regards debt cancellation, I appreciate and respect the views of Jubilee 2000, while also noting that few governments, from developed or developing countries, have adopted the position of calling for total debt cancellation. In respect of general bilateral and multilateral debt, the position taken to date by most developing countries is to generally favour reducing the debt burden of the most heavily indebted poor countries to a sustainable level, which would allow them to foster a process of economic growth and development. As regards Ireland's position, we will strongly encourage the international community, including bilateral donors, to take a generous and flexible approach to debt alleviation and to the situation of the heavily indebted poor countries and will continue to press for deeper debt relief so as to ease the debt burden on developing countries.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the initiatives by Germany and the US to have the G7 consider at their Col<Col N="1409" /> ogne summit next June further measures to strengthen international debt alleviation efforts, especially with regard to the joint World Bank-IMF HIPC Initiative. In the context of the first review of the implementation of the HIPC Initiative, which is currently getting under way, Ireland is calling for a broadening, deepening and accelerating of the application of the initiative.</P>
    <P>The World Bank produces an annual analysis and summary of global development finance which provides comprehensive information on all forms of debt; bilateral, multilateral and commercial. I have arranged to place a copy of the most recent edition of this publication, &ldquo;Global Development Finance 1998&rdquo;, in the Dáil Library for the benefit of all Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>No further information has become available on this issue since my reply to the Deputy on 17 February. As I indicated in that reply, the question of missing persons is one of the important and sensitive issues which will have to be addressed in the context of the search for an overall political solution to the Cyprus question. In July 1981, a Committee on Missing Persons was established, comprising a representative of each of the two communities on the island and a representative appointed by the UN Secretary General. However, progress proved difficult to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1996, on the occasion of the retirement of his representative on the committee, the Secretary General wrote to the leaders of the two communities requesting a reaffirmation of their <Col N="1410" /> commitment to making progress on the issue, before the appointment of a new representative. He set out a number of proposals to which he sought their agreement, concerning the definition of categories of cases, the sequence in which investigations would be carried out and the question of cases without known witnesses. Although both sides informed the Secretary General that they agreed with his proposals, the tasks involved remain to be fully implemented by them. However, in June 1998 the Secretary General appointed Mr. Jean Pierre Ritter as his new representative on the Committee of Mission Persons. The first meeting of the newly reconstituted committee was held on 28 January this year.</P>
    <P>A related but separate development took place in July 1997, when the leaders of the two communities reached bilateral agreement regarding the exchange of information on the location of the graves of missing persons and the return of their remains. Information concerning a number of missing persons is understood to have been subsequently exchanged by both sides.</P>
    <P>Agreement was also reached that each side would proceed at the technical level to acquire the necessary expertise to carry out identification. However, at a bilateral meeting in April 1998 between the two sides at which the Secretary General's deputy special representative was present, the Turkish Cypriot side indicated that it was not prepared to discuss arrangements for the exhumation and return of remains until the Greek Cypriot side agreed to first look into the fate of Greek Cypriot victims of the <i>coup d'état </i>against Archbishop Makarios in 1974. The Turkish Cypriot side claimed that victims of the <i>coup d'état </i>were among those listed as missing. The United Nations has indicated it considers the Turkish Cypriot request as falling outside the terms of the 1997 bilateral agreement between both sides. The Greek Cypriot authorities are understood to have since decided to begin exhumation and identification of the remains located in graves in the area under its control.</P>
    <P>I continue to be concerned at the failure to achieve substantive progress on this important matter. I have no doubt that the issue of missing persons will be among the matters raised during the confidential contacts, which are currently taking place between the leaders of the two communities and the Secretary General's deputy special representative, Dame Anne Hercus, in the search for an overall political solution to the Cyprus question. For Ireland's part, we will continue to urge both communities to make every effort to achieve progress on the matter and we have made clear to the United Nations that we stand ready to provide any assistance which they consider could be helpful in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>At the EU General Affairs Council on 22 February, which I attended, the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan and the consequent demonstrations across Europe were discussed. Following our discussion a declaration was issued in the name of the Union which took note of the assurance of the Turkish Government that Ocalan would receive a fair trial. We emphasised, however, that we expected this to mean fair and correct treatment and an open trial according to the rule of law before an independent court, with access to legal counsel of his choice and with international observers admitted to the trial. We also reiterated our strong opposition to the death penalty. Earlier this month I communicated these views directly to the Speaker and Members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly during their visit to Dublin and they responded to my concerns positively.</P>
      <P>On 3 March the Turkish authorities granted unrestricted access to Ocalan in Imrali prison to representatives of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly. Ocalan has since appointed his lawyers and they meet with him at the prison on a regular basis. They are reported as stating that he is in good health, physically and psychologically, and that the conditions of his detention have improved.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of international observers attending Oçalan's trial, the Turkish authorities have pointed out that while there is no provision in Turkish law for the presence of official observers at a trial, they are in general open to the public, including to foreign representatives. They confirmed that this will apply in Oçalan's case and EU member states are in discussion with the Turkish authorities in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the demonstrations across Europe, the Union in its declaration strongly deplored the fact that the arrest of Ocalan had sparked massive unrest and violent acts resulting in death, hostage taking, intimidation and extensive destruction. We reaffirmed the EU position that such acts of violence are inadmissible and under no circumstances tolerable. We also reiterated our condemnation of all forms of terrorism and stated that the legitimate fight against terrorism must be con<Col N="1412" /> ducted with full respect for human rights, the rule of law and democratic norms. We emphasised that legitimate interests must be expressed through a political process and not through violence. Ireland strongly supports this position.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to bring together Irish ambassadors and State agencies in 1999 to discuss ways in which Irish Embassies can improve their services to business in view of his announcement at the Franco-Irish Chamber of Commerce in Paris on 19 February 1999.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always emphasised that the promotion of exports and inward investment is a major obligation for Irelands network of diplomatic missions.  It forms an important part of the national interests and concerns abroad which embassies are charged with protecting and promoting. Because ambassadors enjoy privileged access to government decision makers and senior business managers, they can be of invaluable assistance to individual companies and state agencies in terms of providing contacts and removing obstacles to business.</P>
      <P>For this reason, I have taken the initiative to hold a seminar in Dublin in early September for ambassadors and other diplomatic staff to explore these issues. I would like to include on that occasion some people from the private sector, who are the customers for the service provided by the embassies and who would be able to make a valuable input.</P>
      <P>Co-operation between embassies and consulates and the overseas representatives of the state agencies plays a fundamental part in Ireland's approach to trade and investment promotion. If co-operation of this kind is to work smoothly, there needs to be an understanding of the different roles of the various state agencies and of the embassy itself. I will be consulting with my ministerial colleagues to ensure that the relevant state agencies are invited to participate in the seminar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Since the middle of February when the situation of Iraq was last raised in this House there have been a number of developments of note.</P>
      <P>In Iraq itself, US and British military aircraft are continuing their activities directed against Iraqi air defences. The Government has made its position as regards such activity clear on a number of occasions. We were deeply disappointed that the use of force in December was deemed necessary. We remain concerned at the continuing military activity both because of its negative effects on the plight of the Iraqi people and because of its destabilising effects both on Iraq and on the region as a whole. I would again reiterate my hope that the current military activity should come to an end as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The issue of whether a particular action is consistent with decisions of the Security Council is a matter in the first instance for the members of the Council. In the present case opinion seems to be divided. It is the responsibility of the Council to resolve such differences.</P>
      <P>The humanitarian situation is one of greatest concern. The Security Council appointed on 30 January three special panels to study the three main aspects of the Iraqi issue and asked them to report back to it by the middle of April. The three panels address issues such as humanitarian assistance, arms inspection and prisoners of war.</P>
      <P>On 25 February the UN Secretary General presented a report to the Security Council on the implementation of the Oil for Food Programme over the previous 180 day period. The main points of the report were as follows: while there had been a increase in the amount of oil exported, the revenue received was down due to the fall in oil prices. As a result only $1.8 billion was available for the humanitarian programme; the first consignment of spare parts and equipment for Iraq's oil refineries agreed under an accelerated approval process had begun to arrive; and partly due to poor Iraqi distribution arrangements and partly to stockpiling by that Government, $275 million worth of medicines and medical supplies were accumulated in warehouses in Iraq.</P>
      <P>Although Security Council members were not fully agreed on the reasons for the inadequacies revealed by the report, there was no dissent following the call by the representative of the Secretary General for a need to look more imaginatively at ways to enhance the programme. I am confident that the UN panel, to which I referred earlier, will present some new proposals to the Council in this context.</P>
      <P>The relevant European Union CFSP Working Group is also seized of this issue. Ireland is taking an active role in its deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply of 17 February to another question on Iraq, I welcome the general thrust of the proposal tabled by France. I am sure <Col N="1414" /> that it will be reflected in the report of the panels which I mentioned earlier and will no doubt be given further consideration by the Security Council when it discusses those reports.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware the nature and gravity of the crisis in Kosovo is such that it is receiving the attention of the entire international community, and in particular in bodies such as the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations, the Council of Europe, as well as several other organisations which provide humanitarian aid and assistance.</P>
      <P>In each such organisation where Ireland is represented, every effort is made to make a constructive contribution to a resolution of the crisis in Kosovo. Under the European Union's CFSP, this is done in close consultation with our partners both with regard to the Union's own policies within the Union or with a view to having them influence larger fora. Where requests for assistance in terms of human or financial resources arise, Ireland considers each such request as positively as possible and contributes in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of deep regret for Ireland, our EU partners and other members of the international community, that there is continuing conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. This conflict is resulting not only in military casualties but also in <Col N="1415" /> unacceptably high levels of civilian fatalities and displacement. It is destabilising both countries in political, humanitarian and economic terms and wasting scarce resources which could otherwise be invested in national development. The Government considers that further loss of life and material destruction can be prevented through an immediate cessation of hostilities and a return to the negotiation framework which had been accepted by the warring parties under the mediation of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).</P>
      <P>The EU has recently adopted a common position imposing an arms embargo on both Ethiopia and Eritrea as called for by UN Security Council Resolution 1227 of 10 February. Along with our European partners, the Government has expressed its willingness to assist the OAU, Ethiopia and Eritrea in the implementation of a peaceful and negotiated settlement. We are supporting the ongoing efforts of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan and his OAU counterpart, Dr. Salim Salim, who recently met in Washington to discuss the conflict, aimed at a non-military settlement. The UN Secretary General has also initiated contingency planning in support of a possible peace-keeping operation. The matter is being addressed by African States including at the OAU Council of Ministers which took place in Addis Ababa on 19-23 March. This was attended by the UN Assistant Secretary General, Mr. Ibrahim Fall, who will report to the UN Security Council. The Eritrean Foreign Minister and the Ethiopian Deputy Foreign Minister discussed the crisis with members of the Security Council in New York on 22 March.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that this latest co-operation between the UN and the OAU, supported strongly by the EU and other members of the international community, can lead to a cessation of the conflict and a resumption of dialogue. The Government considers such a resumption to be essential to overcome the outstanding difficulties between Ethiopia and Eritrea in relation to certain elements of the OAU framework proposals and to prevent further hardship for their people. These concerns have been conveyed bilaterally to both Governments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to a similar question on 9 March, I welcome the establishment of a language body, one part of which will comprise an agency devoted to the promotion of the Irish language on a North-South basis, as one of the six new North-South implementation bodies being established under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The functions and activities of the Irish language agency are set out in the Agreement between the Irish and British Governments which I signed with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Dublin on 8 March. The British-Irish Agreement Act, 1999, which gives legislative effect to the Agreement was signed into law on 22 March. Since then, the two Governments, in consultation as appropriate with the northern parties, have been urgently taking forward the further steps necessary to enable the bodies to function as and from the date of the entry into force of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>As I said on 9 March, the language body will play an important part in meeting the commitments to support the Irish language in the Good Friday Agreement. The language body will have an important role in regard to the general promotion of the Irish language on the island, but most particularly in Northern Ireland. For the first time there will be specific budgetary provisions for the Irish language in Northern Ireland,. This represents a very fundamental change in the position of the language there and demonstrates clearly the inclusive nature of the new structures being established. I also welcome the opportunity the language body will provide to promote a greater awareness of Ulster-Scots culture.</P>
      <P>Heritage matters are not specifically covered in the agreement of 18 December, which identified six areas for North-South implementation bodies and six areas for North-South co-operation. Once the North-South ministerial council has been established, however, all matters of mutual interest within the competence of the administrations, North and South, can be considered within that forum. This will provide a context for possible North-South co-operation on other matters, including heritage issues.</P>

      <P>The 55th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights began its deliberations in Geneva on 22 March last and it will continue its work until 30 April next. In addition to being one of the 53 members of the commission, Ireland will, <Col N="1417" /> for the first time, hold the chair at this commission session. I understand that there are four priority issues for the chair this year.</P>
      <P>The first is the review of mechanisms and procedures of the commission. This session will consider a comprehensive set of proposals aimed at improving the effectiveness of the commission in several areas, including investigation, responsiveness to complaints, legal standard-setting and human rights research. It is hoped that implementation of all or some of these proposals will make a significant improvement to the capacity of the UN to respond to human rights needs. As chair, Ireland will seek to bring this process forward. The second is preparations for the world conference on racism. This session of the commission will oversee a crucial stage in the preparations for this world conference, which is due to take place in 2001. Last week, an open-ended working group was set up to formulate proposals and arrangements for the conference. As chair, Ireland has responsibility for giving this process positive direction and ensuring that it addresses the issues in an open and even-handed manner. The third issue is the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This convention has achieved almost universal ratification, with only two member states of the UN yet to ratify it. The commission will address concerns regarding implementation of the convention and the chair will aim to focus discussion on two themes: first, children in armed conflict and, second, child pornography and trafficking in children. The fourth issue is the question of resources for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The chair hopes to address the institutional arrangements for the provision of financial resources to the High Commissioner's Office.</P>
      <P>With regard to resolutions, it should be noted that the agenda of the commission consists of 21 fixed items and only members of the commission can table resolutions under these items during the session. The chair, therefore, has no role to play in the setting of the agenda or in the tabling of resolutions. The EU normally sponsors the majority of the country resolutions at the commission. This year is no exception, with the EU tabling country resolutions on Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria. On the thematic front, the EU will table resolutions on the rights of the child and on the question of the death penalty. In addition to contributing to the preparation and drafting of EU resolutions on both country situations and thematic concerns, Ireland's national delegation will also continue its traditional sponsoring of the resolution on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Presidency will also deliver, on behalf of the 15 member states, a general statement on human rights at the commission. This statement is currently being finalised and it will be delivered in the coming days. Ireland's delegation has played a significant role in the drafting of this EU <Col N="1418" /> statement and has worked to ensure that it reflects our concerns. Our delegation may also deliver national statements on national human rights institutions and on the independence and impartiality of judges and lawyers.</P>
    <P>Last year, Ireland co-sponsored resolution 1998/72 on the right to development. This was the first time that a statement on the right to development received unqualified support from the membership of the United Nations. The resolution was dedicated to advancing economic and social progress in the developing world, to enable all people to enjoy their fundamental rights and freedoms. This year, Ireland will work to ensure that the spirit of co-operation and compromise which guided last year's negotiations on this subject is maintained. Ireland will also examine the existing mechanisms and procedures for the protection of economic, social and cultural rights with a view to strengthening systems for the protection of these rights.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, who has specific responsibility for human rights issues, addressed the commission on 24 March last and set out the Government's approach to the work of the commission. She expressed especial appreciation for the work of the special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Param Cumaraswamy. In that context, she voiced the Government's concern that the inquiry announced by the British Government into Rosemary Nelson's murder be fully independent. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, also spoke about the new human rights landscape being established in both parts of Ireland under the Good Friday Agreement, stressing that a new human rights culture embodying the spirit of the Agreement, with its credo of fairness and inclusivity, will permeate the new institutions. The Minister of State also addressed the issues of racism and children's rights in her statement.</P>

      <P>The issue of NATO enlargement is in the first instance a matter for the membership of NATO, under the North Atlantic Treaty, and for those countries seeking NATO membership. More generally, the Helsinki Final Act and subsequent OSCE documents provide, among other things, that OSCE states have the right to be or not to be a party to treaties of alliance; they also have the right to neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland believes that the development of the European security architecture should be transparent and responsive to the security concerns of all states. Enlargement of existing security organ<Col N="1419" /> isations should not lead to the re-emergence of divisions in Europe.</P>
    <P>Many of the countries of central and eastern Europe see membership of both the EU and NATO as the best guarantee of their future peace, prosperity and stability. In this perspective, EU and NATO enlargement are autonomous and separate, yet complementary processes in the sense of ensuring Europe-wide security and stability.</P>

      <P>When I launched the new agenda declaration in Dublin on 9 June last year, I stated that it was my intention to pursue this initiative in the context of the General Assembly of the United Nations and at other fora as appropriate.</P>
      <P>In September the eight Foreign Ministers of the new agenda group met in New York and launched a draft resolution at the General Assembly with a view to securing the support of the wider international community for the objectives which the new agenda group had set. This draft resolution became the centrepiece of the disarmament deliberations in the General Assembly and the new agenda countries worked tirelessly to bring the international community to endorse the new direction which we had advanced and to act on foot of our recommendations.</P>
      <P>The General Assembly adopted our draft resolution by 114 votes in favour, with 38 abstentions and 18 negative votes. This was an outstanding result for a resolution which aimed to set aside the impasse in nuclear disarmament and the drift towards acceptance of the indefinite retention of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapon states. It was in particular significant that the non-nuclear weapon states members of NATO decided not to oppose our resolution, recognizing that our approach represented a realistic way forward in nuclear disarmament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much remains to be done, however, to achieve the objectives set out in the new agenda. One area where we are focusing attention is the preparation of the non-proliferation treaty review conference scheduled for next year. This will be a singularly important gathering of the states parties. All the parties to the treaty, both nuclear weapons and non-nuclear weapon states alike, are committed under Article VI to the elimination of nuclear weapons and nuclear disarmament. In the framework of these legally binding commitments it is our intention to urge the <Col N="1420" /> nuclear weapon states to commit themselves unequivocally to pursue those steps required by them to realize the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>We will return to the United Nations General Assembly later this year with a draft resolution and with a view to securing an even greater number of endorsements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfolding situation and crisis in Kosovo were the subject of prolonged consideration by EU heads of state and government and Foreign Ministers at the European Council in Berlin. As I already made clear to the House, I had a separate meeting with the Foreign Ministers of the other EU neutral states, Austria, Finland and Sweden, and it was evident that our views on the NATO action and other aspects of the Kosovo crisis were very close. The Secretary General of the United Nations spoke, I believe, for many when he said it is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace.</P>
      <P>The Government shares the view of many that it is always preferable when there is explicit Security Council authorisation for the use of force. However, in the light of divisions among the permanent members of the Security Council, it was most unlikely that any further more explicit decision would have been agreed. Subsequent discussion at the Security Council has borne out this view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72   together.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for the year 2000 business awareness campaign I launched in December last the Enterprise Ireland information programme which will concentrate on small and medium sized enterprises, as these are the sectors most in need of initiating action on the subject. I refer the Deputy to my reply of 24 March 1999, to Question No. 8334/99, where I gave details of the information campaign. This campaign includes an advertising campaign which was conducted recently over a four week period in newspapers and on radio. This will be relaunched for two weeks after Easter on radio only as this medium has had the greatest impact. To try to accurately gauge their preparedness, Enterprise Ireland are initiating a comprehensive national survey on the levels of compliance of Irish companies. As soon as the first results are available, an assessment will be made as to whether a further advertising campaign is justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I initiated the year 2000 business awareness campaign, I have availed of every possible <Col N="1426" /> opportunity over the last year to bring this issue to as wide an audience as possible. I have addressed a very large number of meetings on the subject, all around the country, both directly in connection with the campaign and also at events organised by other bodies and organisations. The business awareness campaign included seven regional conferences and concluded with a major conference in Dublin which was addressed by the Taoiseach. In view of the foregoing, I do not consider that a major advertising campaign directed at the general public is currently justified. The topic has received huge media coverage over the last two years. The most effective way to minimise the impact on the public is to encourage the business community to achieve compliance.</P>

      <Quest>if unpaid debts in respect of UN peacekeeping duties by the Defence Forces were discussed with the UN Secretary General on his recent visit to Ireland; and, if so, his response in this regard.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of my recent meeting with the UN Secretary General, I took the opportunity to raise Irelands concerns about arrears owing in respect of our participation in UN peacekeeping operations. The Secretary General indicated that he understood these concerns, and that he is working towards improving the arrears situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> As of 26 March 1999, the amount owing to Ireland by the UN arising from our participation in peacekeeping operations was approximately IR£8.4 million, with the largest amount, IR£6.7 million, owing in respect of our participation in UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon, a peacekeeping operation to which Ireland provides some 620 personnel, our most significant contribution to UN peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>Over the six months to 26 March 1999, the UN repaid arrears of IR£4.5 million, almost entirely in respect of UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>Despite the significant repayments made by the UN in the last six months, the issue of arrears owed to Ireland remains of considerable concern. This matter is pursued on an ongoing basis by the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the UN in New York.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the problem of arrears owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries is a result of the financial crisis which the UN has been experiencing for the last number of years, and is not due to any unwillingness on the part of the UN Secretariat to clear arrears. The financial crisis has been caused by the failure of many member states to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peacekeeping budgets in full and on time. We hope that efforts to resolve the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries.</P>

      <P>Discussion has begun within the European Union on the question of arms brokerage and the possibility of all EU member states exercising harmonized controls on such brokering. The development of controls in this area would represent an important step in controlling arms exports, particularly to countries in areas of tension.</P>
      <P>Controls in this area are complex, but the Government would hope that agreement can be reached in the Union without undue delay so that domestic controls can be introduced accordingly. Such controls may require primary legislation. Departments other than the Department of Foreign Affairs would also be involved in developing and enforcing these controls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>One of the services which the Department of Foreign Affairs provides is information and advice to people planning to travel to other countries about possible threats to their safety or health. The most common reasons why people are advised to take special care or not to travel to particular countries or regions are civil unrest, natural disasters and disease epidemics. The main sources of the Department's information about developments in other countries are Irish Embassies and Consulates. It is also guided by the advice EU partners, especially the UK, are giving to their nationals.</P>
      <P>Information and advice is normally given in response to telephone inquiries to the Department's consular section but when circumstances justify it written statements are issued to the news media.</P>
      <P>As part of the Department's response to an unusually large number of inquiries about travel to Turkey received on and after 16 March &ndash;  threats against tourists having been made by the Kurdistan Workers Party on 15 March &ndash;  the following statement was issued to the media on 19 March:</P>
      <P>Irish citizens travelling to Turkey in the coming weeks should be aware that tensions have increased following the arrest of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan and the recently issued threats by the PKK against tourists visiting Turkey.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of this, the Department of Foreign Affairs wishes to advise citizens intending to travel to Turkey that they should be aware of the increased level of risk in visiting the country. Visitors should be vigilant at all times and avoid public gatherings or protests, follow the advice of their tour operators and that of travel representatives. The Department notes that the Turkish authorities attach a high priority to ensuring the safety of visitors to Turkey.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Ankara will continue to monitor the situation closely and advise citizens accordingly.</P>
      <P>That is still our advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> The circumstances in which tour operators refund moneys paid for holiday bookings that are cancelled are matters between the tour operators and their customers only. If tour operators link refunds to advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs against travelling they are entitled to do so but such decisions are theirs, not the Departments. I reject the implication that the advice we give should be determined by any consideration other than the safety of our citizens.</P>

      <P>The circumstances surrounding the deaths of the six individuals whose deaths in 1982 were the subject of the Stalker/Sampson inquiry have been a matter of deep concern to the Government, and were raised on many occasions through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Indeed, in 1988, a special Anglo-Irish Conference was convened at the request of the Government to discuss the decision of the British authorities not to publish the Stalker/Sampson report and not to pursue prosecutions relating to obstruction of justice on the basis of national security.</P>
      <P>Mr. Stalker, in his book published in 1988, gave a detailed account of his investigation and his dealings both with the RUC and with the British Army. He alleged that he encountered hostility from individual officers and that there were efforts by RUC officers to frustrate his investigation. However, the report of Mr. Stalker has never been made public, although the Government has repeatedly called for its publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply to Priority Questions Nos. 1 and 2 outlines progress in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as a whole.</P>
      <P>The agreement between the Irish and British Governments on North-South implementation bodies, which was signed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and myself at Dublin Castle on 8 March 1999, provides for the establishment of bodies in the following six areas: inland waterways; food safety; trade and business development; special EU programmes; language; and aquaculture and marine matters. The bodies will be formally established on the date of the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement done at Belfast on 10 April 1998, along with the other institutions provided for in that Agreement. The British-Irish Agreement Act, which makes the necessary provision in domestic law for the establishment and operation of the bodies, was signed into law on 22 March. Equivalent British legislation has been enacted at Westminster.</P>
      <P>The two Governments, in consultation as appropriate with the Northern Ireland parties, have been urgently taking forward the further steps necessary to enable the bodies to function effectively once they are established. Issues under discussion include the location of the bodies; the identification of possible board members, where boards are involved; the designation of interim Chief Executives, as provided for in the agreement of 8 March; and the secondment of other key staff for the start-up period. The two Departments of Finance, together with the relevant parent Departments, are preparing the detailed financial memoranda for each of the bodies. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, will very shortly be introducing a Supplementary Estimate providing for such additional funding as may be required for the bodies during 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>At our meeting of 21-22 March last, the EU Foreign Ministers reviewed human rights policy towards China, with particular attention focusing on the results of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue over the past twelve months. The question of our approach to China at this year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights was also addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall that the Council of Ministers decided not to table a resolution on China at last years session of the commission because <Col N="1439" /> the Chinese authorities had taken a number of positive steps which had given rise to hopes for a genuine improvement in the human rights situation there.</P>
    <P>Since then, we have witnessed some positive developments. These included China's increased co-operation with the UN human rights system, including the signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the visits by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. The Chinese authorities also agreed to report on Hong Kong under the two International Covenants, while the EU Troika ambassadors were granted access to Tibet in May 1998. There have also been further rounds of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue during which issues such as the use of the death penalty, the practice of administrative detention, the restrictions on religious freedom as well as the lack of freedom of assembly, expression and association, have been addressed.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Council of Ministers is very concerned about the lack of genuine improvements in the human rights situation on the ground. We were particularly alarmed by the crackdown on peaceful political activists last December. We are also concerned about the lack of tangible results arising from the Human Rights Dialogue. This dialogue is not, and cannot be allowed to become, an end in itself but must result in genuine improvements on the ground. We have called for, and expect, the early ratification and implementation of the two UN Covenants as a sign of China's commitment to guarantee the freedoms set out therein. The EU also looks forward to the establishment of a technical co-operation programme with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as part of an effective follow-up to her visit last September.</P>
    <P>The EU Foreign Ministers consider that, on balance, the results of the policy of dialogue and co-operation with China have been positive. We will, therefore, continue to pursue our human rights objectives through these means and a resolution on the human rights situation in China will not be tabled by the EU at the 55th session of the Commission on Human Rights, which is currently taking place in Geneva.</P>
    <P>We will, however, express publicly our growing concerns about human rights in China at this and other relevant human rights fora. On 23 March, the German Foreign Minister, Mr. Fischer, addressing the Commission on behalf of the EU, said:</P>
    <P>the general human rights situation in China, such as for example the frequent imposition of the death penalty &ndash;  which by international standards is handed down with unparalleled frequency &ndash; or the practice of administrative detention, still does not comply with established international standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> The action taken against political dissidents in China has placed a great strain on the European-Chinese dialogue on human rights. We regard the very severe prison sentences imposed upon civil rights activists as unacceptable, especially as these activists merely exercised the rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights signed by China last year.We are likewise concerned about the situation of minorities, particularly in Tibet.</P>
    <P>The EU therefore urges the Chinese Government to ensure that progress in the international sphere is followed by concrete improvements in the human rights situation and in respect of democracy and the rule of law . . .</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, associated Ireland with these remarks when she addressed the commission the following day.</P>
    <P>Our collective concerns about the situation in China will be set out in greater detail by the Presidency during the course of this year's commission, both in its general country statement to be delivered in the coming days under item 9 and during the various debates on thematic human rights issues which are of direct relevance to the situation in China.</P>
    <P>The Foreign Ministers of the EU will, of course, continue to keep this policy under regular review in the light of developments in China.</P>

      <P>Voting mechanisms for the Northern Ireland Assembly elections, the election of the First and Deputy First Ministers and the distribution of Executive posts were agreed in the Good Friday Agreement. That Agreement was subsequently endorsed overwhelmingly by the people of Ireland in referendums, North and South.</P>
      <P>The Government would not support any request to change the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, which it believes is fair and balanced and contains adequate guarantees against domination by any party or group.</P>
      <P>While the De Borda Institute has been in contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to their proposals regarding voting mechanisms, I have not discussed them with the Secretary of State. Clearly a decision as to whether she should meet the Institute is a matter for the Secretary of State herself.</P>

      <P>There are six priority countries for bilateral development assistance under the Irish Aid programme: Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. There are, in addition, bilateral agreements in respect of more limited programmes of assistance to South Africa and Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on these programmes amounted to £46 million in 1998 and is planned to reach £48 million this year. The future development of the programmes is currently being discussed with the Governments concerned.</P>
      <P>The bilateral development programmes are a central element of Ireland's overall programme of official development assistance (ODA). Bilateral assistance enables Ireland to engage in direct development partnerships with individual developing countries. A recent study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that the Irish Aid priority country programmes represent a highly effective model of development co-operation.</P>

      <P>In addition to our mandatory assessed contributions to multilateral development and finance organisations, notably the World Bank Group and EU bodies, Ireland, in common with other donor countries, contributes to a range of UN development agencies and programmes as an expression of our commitment to multilateral aid to developing countries and of the importance which the Government attaches to the work of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies in the field of development co-operation.</P>
      <P>In the European Union, Ireland's mandatory contribution this year to the European Development Fund will amount to approximately £12.41 million. The European Development Fund has a range of development programmes in the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries party to the Lóme Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of our voluntary contributions to UN agencies are made in the form of unearmarked core contributions to their general budgets and are not designated for specific locations or programmes. A significant exception to that practice involves our voluntary contribution to the World <Col N="1442" /> Health Organisation (WHO), which is allocated to specific WHO programmes under a Framework Irish Aid/WHO Programme of Co-operation for Africa, with the objective of concentrating Irish Aid funds on health interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. An element of earmarking for specific programmes and locations has also applied in respect of our voluntary contributions to the United Nations Volunteers (UNV), the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). In 1998 contributions were made in support of UNV projects in Ethiopia, South Africa and Uganda; in support of human rights activities in Colombia, Bosnia, Burundi, Malawi and Uganda; and in support of UNDCP projects in Peru and Tanzania.</P>
    <P>Our voluntary contributions to UN development agencies and funds have increased significantly in recent years, in line with the expansion of our ODA programme, from £2.5 million in 1993 to £8.43 million in 1998. That has contrasted with the general trend over the same period with regard to donor contributions to UN agencies. Ireland is now among the top 20 donors to UNDP, UNICEF and UNHCR, the three main UN agencies involved in development and relief work. In 1997 we were 15th in terms of <i>per capita </i>contributions to UNDP and eighth in terms of <i>per capita </i>contributions to UNICEF, while in 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are available, we were the eighth largest contributor to UNHCR in <i>per capita </i>terms.</P>
    <P>In addition to our voluntary contributions to UN agencies and other multilateral institutions, Ireland provides specific humanitarian and other contributions to these institutions. For information on this area I refer the Deputy to the annexes to the 1997 Irish Aid Annual Report &ndash; the most recent year for which statistics are available.</P>
    <P>While there is no UN target for contributions to international development organisations, agencies or bodies, Ireland remains among the most active of donor governments in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that human rights are a priority issue for this Government and a central component of our foreign policy. We believe that the international community has an obligation to act when it has concerns, and that these concerns should be pursued whenever possible in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue, conscious of the responsibility which <Col N="1443" /> devolves on all Governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
      <P>The United Nations monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world on a continuing basis, particularly through its system of special rapporteurs and working groups appointed by the UN Commission on Human Rights each year. The 55th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights commenced its deliberations in Geneva on 22 March last and it will continue its work until 30 April next.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important events in the human rights calendar. Delegations from 140 countries and over 200 non-governmental organisations will attend the meetings of the Commission. It is expected to produce over 200 documents and adopt approximately 80 resolutions, of which 16 will concern specific countries and 24 will concern thematic issues.</P>
      <P>In addition to being a member of the Commission, Ireland has, for the first time, been selected to chair this session. Our Permanent Representative in Geneva, Ambassador Anderson, will be presiding over the proceedings in Geneva over the next five weeks and her selection is both a recognition of the consistent and progressive policies on human rights adopted by successive Irish Governments and a measure of the ambassador's own standing at the United Nations in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The EU normally sponsors the majority of the country resolutions at the Commission and this year will table country resolutions on Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria. The EU will also table thematic resolutions on the rights of the child and on the question of the death penalty. Ireland will actively contribute to the drafting of these resolutions and we will also table our traditional resolution on the elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief. Ireland will also support those resolutions tabled by other members of the Commission which, in our view, will benefit human rights.</P>
      <P>Other country situations to be addressed by the Commission include, <i>inter alia</i>, Colombia, Kosovo, East Timor, Palestine, Rwanda, Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Burundi, Cuba and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>The EU Presidency will also deliver, on behalf of the 15 member states, a general statement on human rights at the Commission. This statement is currently being finalised and will be delivered in the coming days. Ireland's delegation has played a significant role in the drafting of this EU statement and has worked to ensure that our concerns are reflected therein.</P>
      <P>We believe that applying concerted international pressure through multilateral organisations, such as the UN Commission on Human Rights, is one of the most effective means of highlighting and combating human rights abuses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed my total opposition, and that of the Government, to the use of the death penalty on a number of occasions over the past two years, most recently in my statement in the Seanad on 17 February last.</P>
      <P>As I said on that occasion, I am committed to availing of every suitable opportunity to press for the abolition of capital punishment. I also expressed the view of the Irish Government and that of the other member states of the European Union that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>I informed the Seanad that common guidelines for EU initiatives on the issue of the death penalty had been agreed and adopted by EU Foreign Ministers in June 1998. These guidelines state that where the death penalty still exists the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where individual cases violate basic minimum standards, the European Union will consider making a specific intervention. It is our strong belief that an EU intervention carries greater force than individual bilateral approaches by national Governments. This common EU policy does not imply that our scope for bilateral action has been curtailed. We are, rather, channelling our efforts towards building this common policy into an instrument of real strength which can make a difference in the global campaign.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption of these guidelines, the Union's collective efforts have continued to focus on promoting universal abolition of the death penalty. We have pressed for abolition and have issued démarches on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries, including, <i>inter alia,</i> Sudan, Benin, Iran, Russia, Ukraine, the Palestinian Authority, the Philippines, Sierra Leone and the United States. EU policy dictates that countries should be given every assistance in introducing a moratorium or abolishing capital punishment. In this regard, we have publicly welcomed and supported such decisions in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Kirghizistan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that the 55th Commission on Human Rights, which is currently taking place in Geneva, provides us with an opportunity to further the international campaign for the abolition of capital punishment. At the last two sessions of the Commission, Ireland strongly supported the resolution on the question of the <Col N="1445" /> death penalty, which had been tabled by Italy, and we campaigned actively for its adoption. Last year, we made a national statement on this question. At this years session, the European Union will introduce the draft resolution on the death penalty and Ireland will work with its EU partners to ensure maximum support and co-sponsorship for this resolution.</P>

      <P>The Balkan states, other than Greece which is an EU partner, and Bulgaria which is an applicant for membership of the Union, are Albania and those of former Yugoslavia, namely, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Slovenia.</P>
      <P>Ireland has diplomatic relations with each of these states. In the case of Greece the ambassador is accredited on a residential basis in Athens; in the case of all the others the respective ambassador is accredited on a non-residential basis. The purpose is to develop relations with each in so far as this is possible, but varying conditions in each, including the attitude of their respective Governments to regional and international issues, affects the nature, depth and prospects for further development of each relationship.</P>
      <P>With regard to Albania and the states which emerged from former Yugoslavia, Ireland in addition joins with its EU partners in the framework of CFSP, in dealing with them. In this context Slovenia is in a separate category as it is an applicant country for EU membership. All of the other countries are dealt with by the EU under its regional approach and political conditionality. The texts which govern this policy were approved by the General Affairs Council of 29 April 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose and goal of this policy is to assist each country in carrying out their stated aspirations for closer relations with the Union &ndash; all have expressed the wish for eventual EU membership &ndash; and the policy is designed to spell out in each case the Union's expectations of performance in such areas as democratization, observance <Col N="1446" /> of human rights, treatment of minorities, fulfilment of international obligations and undertakings, development of market economies and similarly related subjects, which would bring them closer to the behaviour and practice of the Union and its member states.</P>
    <P>Under a mechanism of twice-yearly reviews, progress is evaluated and when found to be satisfactory, the Union's relationship with the country in question can be improved and reflected through a formal arrangement. In the case of a reversal in standards or behaviour, measures granted may be withdrawn and the relationship downgraded.</P>
    <P>The stages of relationship under this policy are: granting of autonomous trade measures, PHARE funding, co-operation agreement, association agreement, application for membership and finally membership itself.</P>
    <P>The regional approach and political conditionality takes fully into account the difficult recent history of the region and that fact that relations between two or more of the countries in question may be difficult. While the policy encourages each country to improve its relations with the other countries in question, it has been made clear to each that performance will be judged individually and none will be penalised or held hostage by the refusal of another country to co-operate in such bilateral improvements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, is the legislative basis for the licensing of scheduled bus services in this country. This legislation governs the provision of passenger services, other than those provided by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.</P>
      <P>In considering an application for a licence under the Act, my Department is required to have regard to whether the proposed service is &ldquo;required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the proposed service&rdquo;. This legislative requirement has meant in practice that licences have often been refused to private operators where a service is already being provided, usually by a CIE company.</P>
      <P>There is widespread acceptance that there are a number of difficulties associated with the implementation of the Road Transport Act, 1932. It is clear that this is a very complex matter and that there are no simple solutions.</P>
      <P>As outlined in my Department's statement of strategy it is planned to carry out a review of options for the effective regulation of the bus market with a view to introducing legislation to replace the 1932 Act. This review will focus on improving customer service, effective enforcement, fair competition and appropriate integration of services. Preliminary work has started on the review and all possible options, including that referred to in the Deputy's question, will be considered.</P>

      <P>Under the EU air transport liberalisation measures it is open to any air carrier licensed by a European Economic Area member state, 15 EU states and Norway and Iceland, to <Col N="1453" /> introduce services between EEA member states. With the completion, in April 1997, of the Single European Market in air transport, the introduction of services by airlines, the capacity to be provided and the fares to be charged are matters for the commercial judgment of the carriers concerned and there are no longer any Government controls.</P>

      <Col N="1454" /> I am conscious of the concerns of the public with regard to the public transport system. It is clear to me that the main cause of these concerns relates to the lack of investment in bus and train services over the years. I am glad to say that this Government is committed to reversing that policy and the investment needs of CIE are currently being actively addressed.</P>

Troop costs in respect of these missions are calculated at the rate of $1087.10 US per person per month.</P>
      <P>On 29 March 1999, the total amount owing to my Department by the United Nations in respect of contributions towards troop and other costs associated with the participation of Defence Force personnel in UN missions was calculated at IR£8.4 million approximately.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>The herdowner lodged an appeal on 28 May 1998 concerning his 1997 suckler cow premium application and his suckler cow quota. The herd- owner applied for suckler cow premium for 28 cows. As one tag number was listed twice on the application, only 27 cows were eligible for payment. In 1997 the herdowner had a permanent suckler cow quota of 26 plus nine quota rights which were allocated to him from the national reserve. Quota rights allocated from the national reserve which are not used cannot be retained by the herdowner. An appeal was examined by the headage and premia appeals unit and was found to be unsuccessful. The herdowner was informed of the outcome on 9 February 1999.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the REP scheme that each applicant lodges an agri-environmental plan drawn up by an approved planner with his/her application. On 28 July 1998 all planners were notified that plans involving commonage could not be accepted pending the availability of framework plans. The applicant's planner should therefore have been aware that the plan could not be submitted at that time. Any fee charged for the drawing up of a plan is a matter between the farmer and the planner involved.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 1995 suckler cow premium on six cows. He had a suckler quota of three premium rights and was, therefore, paid suckler cow premium on three cows. He also applied for, and was paid on, eight special beef animals, each over 24 months, under the 1995 special beef premium scheme. He declared an area of 18.79 hectares on his 1995 area aid application.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the regulations, extensification premium is payable on all animals paid under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes if the stocking density on the holding is less than 1.4 Lu/Ha. The person named had a total of 11 Lus, three suckler cow Lus and eight special beef Lus, for 1995. The stocking density was, therefore, 0.58 Lu/Ha, 11 Lus divided by 18.79 hectares. This entitled the person named to extensification premium on 11 animals amounting to £322.19. However, the person named was overpaid under the 1995 headage scheme and the amount of £322.19 was offset against this overpayment.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for 1996 suckler cow premium on seven cows. He had a suckler cow quota for six premium rights and was, therefore, paid suckler cow premium on six cows. He also applied for and was paid on 13 animals under the 22 month special beef premium schemes. Twelve of those animals were over two years and were equivalent to 1 Lu each and one animal was under two years and was therefore equivalent to 0.6 Lu. The total livestock units for 1996 were 18.6.</P>
      <P>He had an area of 12.26 hectares for 1996. The stocking density was, therefore, 1.51 Lu/Ha, 18.6 divided by 12.26, for 1996. As the stocking density was not less than 1.4 Lu/Ha the person named has no entitlement to extensification premium in 1996.</P>
      <P>The person named applied for, and was paid on, six suckler cows under the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme. He also applied for, and was paid on, three animals under the ten month special beef premium scheme and six animals under the 22 month special beef premium scheme each equivalent to 0.6 Lu. He made a further application for 16 animals equivalent to 10.8 Lus under the 22 month premium scheme. Of these, four were rejected but counted for stocking density &ndash; two were females and two were previously paid on. He was paid at a reduced rate on the remaining 12 animals. The total livestock units for 1997 were 22.2. He had an area of 12.72 hectares for 1997. The stocking density was, therefore, 1.74 Lu/Ha, 22.2 divided by 12.72, for 1997. As the stocking density was not less than 1.4 Lu/Ha the person named has no entitlement to extensification premium for 1997.</P>

      <P>The person concerned lodged an application, which included commonage land, under the REP scheme on 11 August 1998.</P>
      <P>The revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for all commonage land.</P>
      <P>The preparation of the framework plans is being carried out under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. As there are approximately 8,000 commonages in all it will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages.</P>
      <P>Pending the availability of commonage framework plans an interim national framework plan has been put in place to facilitate the processing of REPS applications which include commonage land. Under the interim national framework plan ewe numbers shall not exceed 70 per cent of the 1998 levels in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Priority is being given to the preparation of commonage framework plans in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry and it is expected that many of these plans will be available by the end of June 1999. When commonage framework plans become available all plans drawn up under the <Col N="1469" /> interim national framework plan will need to be revised to conform with the conditions laid down for the individual commonage concerned.</P>

      <P>Following the examination by the disadvantaged areas appeals panel of areas for reclassification, an additional 30 per cent of County Monaghan was designated more severely handicapped by the European Commission in 1995. This brought to 73 per cent the land area of County Monaghan classified as more severely handicapped.</P>
      <P>A subsequent re-check of disadvantaged areas in the county was carried out and as a result my Department submitted a supplementary proposal to the European Commission to include additional areas of County Monaghan as more severely handicapped. The proposal was agreed in February 1999 and now 85 per cent of the land area of County Monaghan is classified more severely handicapped.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that based on the data at the disposal of my officials, all areas of County Monaghan which could be shown to satisfy the criteria for more severely handicapped status have now been re-classified.   </P>

      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the scheme of early retirement from farming, the early retirement pension has to be reduced by any national retirement pension payable to the beneficiary. In a joint management situation any national retirement pension received by both the beneficiary and his/her spouse has to be deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>
      <P>This was a case of joint management, that is, the applicant's husband was the landowner releasing the land but the early retirement pension was paid to his wife by virtue of the fact that she was considered to be managing the farm with her husband. The purpose of this arrangement was to maximise the benefit to the applicant and her spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applicant's husband became entitled to non-contributory old age pension from 21 November 1997. However, this Department was not <Col N="1475" /> made aware of the fact until September 1998. As a result, an overpayment of £3,604.64 arose under the early retirement scheme which is currently being recovered at the rate of £100.13 per month.</P>
    <P>As the scheme of early retirement from farming is 75 per cent funded by the EU, this Department is precluded from writing off this overpayment.</P>

      <P>The marketing and use of most organochlorine pesticides have been prohibited since 1987. However, a small number of plant protection products containing lindane are permitted for use in the control of insects, as a seed dressing and in timber preservation. The quantities used in 1997 were less than ten tonnes.</P>
      <P>Lindane is currently being reviewed in the context of Council Directive 91/414/EEC on the authorisation of plant protection products. A study is being examined in the context of the scientific peer review system established by the European Commission. It is expected this review will be completed later in 1999 and a decision will be taken then on the future use of lindane.</P>
      <P>Lindane is among the compounds included in the national monitoring programme for pesticide residues in food. The maximum residue limit, MRL, specified under EU regulations is 0.2mg/kg of fat. In the period 1990 to 1997 some 446 samples of dairy produce were analysed for pesticide residues and none exceeded the prescribed MRL.</P>

      <P>The Agenda 2000 agreement on milk provides for the continuation of the quota system for the period up to 2006. It also provides for a 15 per cent price reduction along with compensation to producers to commence from 2005.</P>
      <P>Each member state will receive a quota increase. For most of these member states there will be a 1.5 per cent increase commencing in 2005. In Ireland's case, a specific allocation of 2.86 per cent additional quota &ndash; 150,000 tonnes or 32 million gallons &ndash; was agreed. Two thirds of this will be available with effect from 1 April 2000, with the balance available from 1 April 2001.</P>
      <P>Thus, while the overall agreement to extend quotas and delay the price reduction will provide a price stable environment for Irish producers for that period, the special quota allocation negotiated for Ireland is of particular benefit. This is not only because it is almost twice the increase allocated to most other member states but also because it begins to become available for use by Ireland four years before the imposition of any price reduction.</P>

      <P>Under the current arrangements, the extensification premium is payable on male cattle and suckler cows at a rate of £43.13 per head at stocking rates of less than 1.0 lu/ha and £30.06 per head at a stocking rate of between 1.0 and 1.4 lu/ha. Stocking density is calculated on the basis of (a) all forage area available to a producer and (b) the number of male cattle and suckler cows submitted for premium payments, the number of ewes submitted for the ewe premium and the number of dairy cows used to fill the milk quota held by the producer.</P>
      <P>The Commission's proposals under Agenda 2000 provided for (i) the restriction of forage to grazed pasture; (ii) all cattle over six months on the holding and ewes submitted for the ewe premium to be counted in the calculation of stocking density and (iii) the replacement of the two tier premium system by a single premium of £78.76 per head payable on farms with a stocking density of less than 1.4 lu/ha.</P>
      <P>Under the final agreement on Agenda 2000, the Commission proposals were amended as follows: all grassland can be included in the definition of forage and member states will have the option of implementing the original Commission proposal as at (iii) above or the following arrangement:</P>
      <P>2000/2001: premium of £52 per head where the stocking density is below 1.6 lu/ha; premium of £26 per head where the stocking density is between 1.6 and 2.0 lu/ha.</P>
      <P>From 2002: a premium of £63 per head where the stocking density is below 1.4 lu/ha; a premium of £31.5 per head where the stocking density is between 1.4 and 1.8 lu/ha.</P>
      <P>The original Commission proposals would have excluded approximately 35 per cent of existing beneficiaries from the premium. I am satisfied that the arrangements which I negotiated will ensure that the vast majority of these producers will retain eligibility for the premium.</P>

      <P>My Department estimates that the original Commission proposals &ndash; March 1998 &ndash;  would have cost Irish farmers up to £233 million in the first year after all the changes were phased in by year 2003 and that the total cost to farmers would have been £1,386 million over the seven year period 2000 to 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> The agreement as finalised by the European Council in Berlin on 24-26 March 1999 will result in a much reduced loss of £14 million in the first year after all changes have been phased in, and this does not occur until 2007.</P>
    <P>The accompanying table demonstrates that, on the same basis, the final deal will mean a gain of £395 million to farm income over the period 2000 to 2006. The national gain over the period will be even greater, £666 million, because of the additional domestic benefits from lower product prices.</P>

      <P>The original Commission proposals for reform of the beef regime in the context of Agenda 2000 would have represented an annual loss of some £150 million for Irish producers post-2002 when the measures became fully effective. This estimate was based on the assumption that cattle prices would fall by the full amount of the reduction in support prices. Based on the same assumption, the value of the beef package which I negotiated on 11 March is estimated to be worth approximately £52 million per annum to Irish cattle producers post 2002, falling to £42 million from 2006 when the FEOGA funded supplementary suckler cow premium will no longer be payable in regions in transition from Objective One.</P>
      <P>With regard to implementation of the measures, the reduction in prices will be phased in over three years, beginning on 1 July 2000. The safety net intervention arrangements will apply from 1 July 2002. The increases in the premia and the new slaughter premium and the national envelope will also be phased in over three years, beginning on 1 January 2000.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the major improvements which I secured in the course of the negotiations will be of major benefit to Irish producers both in terms of compensation for the reduction in prices and in protecting the premia structure suited to Irish conditions and the production base which has been built up since 1992.</P>

      <P>The change in the rates of vehicle registration tax, VRT, which took effect from 1 January, 1999 has resulted in an increase in the tax payable on all cars with an engine capacity above 1400 cc. Cars which are typically used as taxis are generally over 2000 cc. In the absence of particulars of the vehicle in question, it is not possible to confirm the precise amount of the tax payable. However, it should be noted that the cost of adaptation to provide wheelchair access is not included in the chargeable value for VRT purposes.</P>

      <P>There is already a level playing field in that the same tax regime applies to large and to small scale enterprises. The Deputy actually seems to seek a tax advantage for certain producers.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce a zero, a low or a staggered system of excise duty on beer brewed</P>
      <P>in small scale breweries. I refer the Deputy to somewhat similar Parliamentary Questions replied to on 9 February 1999, 16 February 1999, 23 February 1999 and 25 February 1999 which comprehensively deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the matter was discussed at some length during the Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>General Order C&amp;E No 132/1932 set out the requirements necessary to qualify for a rebate of duty on beer brewed from home malted cereals. The enabling legislation was section 41 of the Finance Act, 1932 which provided for a rebate at the rate of five shillings (25p) per standard barrel on the first five thousand standard barrels of home beer, brewed in a year, where at least 80 per cent of the cereals used in the brewing of beer were malted or roasted in the State. This section was repealed by Section 52 of the Finance Act, 1978.</P>
      <P>I should, of course, inform the Deputy that the granting of a rebate of duty in favour of home malted cereals or any other home produce is now prohibited under EU Single Market rules.</P>

      <P>When the taxation of credit union members' savings was raised during the Report Stage of this year's Finance Bill, I indicated that there are a number of issues which must be considered.</P>
      <P>These include matters such as tax equity and Exchequer cost, particularly if tax breaks given to credit union savers had to be extended to savers in other financial institutions. In addition, there is also an EU dimension which must be considered in full. The corporation tax exemption for credit unions, which I renewed last year, has been questioned as a State aid in Brussels. I understand that one consideration influencing the Commission in taking a benign attitude to this exemption is that the members themselves are liable to income tax on the dividends. However, this attitude might change if we were to exempt dividends from income tax.</P>
      <P>The working group, which I set up last year to examine the taxation treatment of credit union members' savings, reported back to me last October. The independent chairman set out a number of recommendations but, the group as a whole, failed to agree. The different views expressed reflect the complexity of this issue and the need to examine carefully all the implications before coming forward with firm proposals.</P>

      <P>The present tax treatment of credit unions is as follows: the surplus income or profits of credit unions are exempt from corporation tax, an exemption that I continued in the Finance Act, 1998; dividends and interest on credit union shares or deposits are liable to tax at the members or depositor's marginal income tax rate which can be zero, 24 per cent or 46 per cent; there is no notification by credit unions to Revenue of dividends or interest paid to their members. However, the individual credit union member must report the income to Revenue as has always been the position under income tax law.</P>

      <P>With regard to the tax treatment of spouses, under the income tax code married couples have the option of joint assessment, separate assessment or of being assessed as two single people. Under joint assessment, either spouse can be nominated as the assessable person. Where they avail of this option they are entitled to double the allowances and rate bands available to a single person. The combined allowances can be allocated between the spouses on the basis of their instructions to the tax office. In a case where only one of the spouses is in paid employment, the facility for joint assessment is of significant benefit as the couple's total tax allowances can be allocated to the employed spouse.</P>
      <P>The primary reason why married women who work may be taxed at a high rate on low earnings is that in these cases most of the couples' income tax personal allowances are being used by their husbands. In this case, the wife avails of only the PAYE allowance, which was standard rated and increased to £1,000 in the 1999 budget.</P>
      <P>Deputies should, however, be aware that regardless of whether one or both spouses are in employment, the combined tax bill of all married couples will generally fall by over £10 per week as a result of the major tax chances announced in the budget. Nevertheless, the changes in standard rating of allowances and widening of the tax bands announced in the budget may leave one spouse with greater allowances and the other spouse with lesser allowances. However, the information leaflet issued recently by the Revenue Commissioners with the tax-free allowance certificates specifically points this out and invites married taxpayers who wish to change the way in which the allowances are allocated between them to complete the attached form or contact their local tax office.</P>

They do not feel that a waiver or reduction of the basic interest liability can be justified when all the circumstances are taken into account. However, as has already been pointed out to the solicitor acting for the taxpayer, they are prepared to accept payment of the amount due by instalments.

      <P>In February of last year I established a working group to review the Child Abuse Guidelines issued by the then Department of Health in 1987 and the guidelines concerning the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and Garda issued in 1995. The group has met on 14 occasions to date.</P>
      <P>I understand that a complete set of draft guidelines were examined by the group at its most recent meeting on 22 March. I further understand that two more meetings of the group will be required to finalise the drafting of the new national guidelines. I am very satisfied with the substantial progress which the group has been able to achieve to date and I can assure the House that after I receive the revised national guidelines from the group, I will proceed as expeditiously as possible to have them published and circulated.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 204 together.</P>
      <P>Allergies arise from a very wide variety of causes and affect individuals in many different ways. Given the nature of allergies, which can range from minor irritants to more severe allergic conditions and the fact that not all people affected by allergies present for treatment, it is difficult to ascertain whether there has been any overall increase in prevalence during the past decade. For the most serious allergic reactions requiring hospitalisation, data are available from the hospital in-patient enquiry &ndash; HIPE &ndash; system.</P>
      <P>For the period 1994 to 1997 the number of people hospitalised for allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and anaphylactic shock are shown in the table below. It should be noted that HIPE refers to acute publicly-funded hospitals only and that 1994 is the first year for which comprehensive data are available from this system.</P>

    <P>I will also forward to the Deputy details of some reports on allergic conditions from medical journals which may be of interest to him.</P>
    <P>As with other conditions, persons with allergies are entitled to services depending on their eligibility category. Medical card holders are, of course, entitled to receive the full range of ser<Col N="1495" /> vices free of charge. Non-medical card holders who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication. Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 July 1999 the existing drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes will be merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit or individual. No family or individual will have to pay more than £42 in any month on prescribed medicines. Any expenditure on prescribed medication in excess of £42 will be met by the State. To qualify under the present drug cost subsidisation scheme, patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure. There are no qualifying criteria for this new drug payment scheme and, as such, this scheme is open to everyone.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for An t-Ard Chláraitheoir (the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages) and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Registration of Births Act, 1996 No. 36 of 1996) introduced a number of changes in the format of the register of births including the regis<Col N="1496" /> tration of a surname for the child. These changes apply to all births registered on or after 1 October 1997. Section 1(3) of that Act provides that the surname of the child to be entered in the register shall be that of the mother or father of the child as shown in the register or both, Section 1(4) of that Act provides that when the birth of a child is being re-registered the surname of the child shall be that which had been entered in the register on the initial registration.</P>
    <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy the birth was registered, in accordance with the provisions of the 1996 Act, on the signatures of both parents and the entry includes details of both the father and the mother as well as the surname assigned to the child by the parents. In these circumstances it is not open to An t-Ard Chláraitheoir to authorise the amendment referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I understand that, prior to the introduction of the new format of the birth register, an information leaflet was produced for the information of parents. The leaflet advised parents, <i>inter alia</i>, to give careful consideration to the surname to be assigned to the child, in order that the most appropriate surname be given to the child within the limits set out in the Act.</P>

      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland's GMO and Novel Foods Sub-Committee advises me on issues relating to the genetic modification of foodstuffs and affords a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food.</P>
      <P>Guidelines to ensure the safety of genetically modified foods, including issues relating to allergenicity and antibiotic resistance, have been developed at international level by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) as well as the European Commission. These guidelines for the assessment of the safety and nutritional quality of foods derived from modern biotechnology enable potential risk to public health to be readily established and are used by the GMO and Novel Foods Sub-Committee in its deliberations.</P>
      <P>Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 introduced a statutory pre-market approval system for novel foods through the European Community. Foods and food ingredients which have not been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community as of 15 May 1997 fall within the scope of this regulation. The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients intended for human consumption, including, <i>inter alia</i>, genetically modified food, must undergo a safety assessment on a case-by-case basis and be officially authorised before being place on the European market. These controls provide protection to consumers and I am keeping the matter under continuing review to ensure that this continues to be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together.</P>
      <P>EU law requires that irradiated foods be so labelled. These provisions, which have been transposed into Irish legislation, are enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. I understand that the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has made inquiries to establish the level and range of irradiated foods being imported into Ireland and has concluded that the quantities and range of foods involved are very insignificant.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament and the Council have recently agreed two new directives on foods and food ingredients treated with ionising radiation. The first directive, a framework directive, lays down the general provisions on ionising radiation such as the conditions for treatment, the rules governing the approval and control of irradiation facilities and the labelling provisions.</P>
      <P>The second directive, an implementing directive, lists foodstuffs which can be treated with ionising radiation together with the maximum doses authorised for the intended purpose. The complete positive list will be established in stages. The Commission will, by 31 December 2000 at the latest, submit a proposal intended to establish a final list.</P>
      <P>I welcome the general provisions of these directives and, in particular, their concern with consumer protection and information. My Department is responsible for the implementation of these directives in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> In September 1994, the Food Safety Advisory Committee presented its second report on irradiated food to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. The Committee endorsed its previous recommendation that the irradiation of foodstuffs is an acceptable and safe practice when carried out in accordance with the Codex Alimentarius Commission general standard for irradiated food and the Codex Code of Practice for the operation of radiation facilities for irradiated foods in international trade. The practice has the potential for reducing food wastage and spoilage.</P>

    <P>The most recent published data relating to levels of patient re-admissions to acute care is available in the publication Activities of Irish Psychiatric Services, 1996, published by the Health Research Board. In 1996 a total of 19,526 persons were re-admitted to acute in-patient care; a breakdown of the number re-admitted from placements in a supported environment in the community is not available. As the Deputy will appreciate, persons discharged from psychiatric hospital frequently suffer a deterioration or relapse in their mental condition, particularly in the case of serious mental illness such as schizophrenia. Re-admission to hospital is often necessary when such relapses occur. However, there is no evidence that the rate of re-admission from community residences is greater than that from other sources.</P>

      <P>I understand that approximately 11,600 persons were committed to prisons in 1998.</P>
      <P>Where a prisoner is identified by the prison medical services as requiring psychiatric care and treatment, specialist consultant psychiatric services are provided to prisons in Dublin by two consultant forensic psychiatrists with the assistance of other medical staff employed at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, Dublin, which is administered by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In relation to prisons located at Cork, Limerick, Castlerea and Portlaoise, consultant psychiatrists from the local health boards provide consultation inputs as required. Where necessary, the Central Mental Hospital provides assessment, treatment and care services to prisoners who may be transferred there from prisons on the advice of a consultant psychiatrist or a consultant forensic psychiatrist as appropriate. In 1998, a total of 156 prisoners were transferred from the prison service to the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
      <P>The forensic psychiatric services at the Central Mental Hospital are being expanded and I have approved the provision of £200,000 additional revenue resources in 1999 to assist the development of such services within the prison system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 250 together.</P>
      <P>A revised proposal for an extension of the Loughrea regional water supply scheme to Craughwell was recently received in my Department. As the scheme is not included in the 1999 Water and Sewerage Services Investment Programme it comes within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-06. In the meanwhile the scheme will be considered, along with all the other competing proposals, under the rural towns and villages initiative, details of which will be announced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The maintenance and improvement of all classes of non-national roads in their areas is a matter for the road authorities, to be funded from their own resources supplemented by allocations from the Local Government Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significantly increased financing has been made available in recent years aimed at systematically improving our non-national roads. I have <Col N="1508" /> allocated over £237 million for non-national roads in 1999, an increase of over £37 million or nearly 19 per cent on the original 1998 allocation figure of almost £200 million, which was in itself a record.</P>
    <P>This figure included £138 million for the restoration programme, an increase of over £20 million on last year's restoration programme allocation, which is firm evidence of the Government's commitment to completing the restoration programme on schedule by 2005.</P>
    <P>This year's non-national road grant allocation also includes discretionary grants to county councils of approximately £23 million and EU co-financed grants to county councils of almost £39 million.</P>
    <P>Sligo County Council's share of this year's greatly enhanced funding is £5,249,000, an increase of 15 per cent on 1998 payment figure of £4,568,154 and an increase of 26 per cent on the 1997 payment figure of £4,168,000. The initial selection/prioritisation of projects to be assisted from the various grant categories is a matter for Sligo County Council.</P>
    <P>The details of Sligo County Council's non-national roads grants from 1995 to 1999 are as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, provides for certain developments to be exempt from the need to obtain planning permission under the Planning Acts, for example, works which do not materially affect the character of a structure. In addition, regulations made under section 4 of the Act prescribe certain developments which are not required to obtain planning permission, because of their small scale or because they would not materially impinge on the environment such as small domestic extensions, or farm buildings within farmyard complexes, subject to certain limitations. Mobile phone masts generally require planning permission. However, the replacement of masts or the addition of a limited number of antennae to existing masts do not require permission as such development is considered not to constitute a material alteration.</P>
      <P>However, in relation to the enforcement of planning control exempted development is not, by definition, subject to the procedures relating to planning permission and the making of objections by third parties does not arise as no decision is required of the planning authority in the case of such development. Similarly, there can be no duty on the planning authority to inspect exempted development.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that the issue of planning enforcement generally has been considered as part of the current review of the planning code. My proposals in this regard will be contained in a comprehensive Bill to reform and consolidate planning law to be published by mid-year.</P>

      <P>There is no scheme currently available specifically to house emigrants from Ireland who wish to return home. Many who wish to return home are in a position to provide housing from their own resources. Others, however, may need to apply to a local authority or approved voluntary housing organisation. Applications or inquiries about eligibility for local authority housing should be directed by the individual to the local authority in whose functional area they wish to reside. Information on accommodation provided by approved voluntary housing organisations may be obtained from the Irish Council for Social Housing (84 Merrion Square, Dublin 2) who are the representative organisation for the voluntary and non-profit housing sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> Essential repair grants are administered by local authorities in accordance with the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993 and guidelines issued by my Department. The regulations and the guidelines give certain discretion to the local authorities in relation to the nature of works to be grant aided, the determination as to whether an application meets the eligibility criteria, the amount of assistance to be provided, the relative priority of applications, etc.</P>
    <P>The regulations or guidelines do not stipulate an age which an applicant must have reached in order to qualify for an essential repairs grant. The grants are available to elderly persons living alone or with other such persons and are payable in respect of houses which cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost in circumstances where, with the carrying out of necessary essential repairs, the life of a house would be prolonged to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, authorities may pay grants up to the full approved cost of the repairs and recoup two thirds of their expenditure on such grants, to a current limit of £3,000 in any one case, from my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the public concern that his Department's driving testers regard driving at less than the speed limit especially in built-up areas as failure to make sufficient progress; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that this has led to a general practice among driving instructors of teaching or advising learner drivers to drive at or slightly above the legal speed limit for fear of failing their tests due to perceived fail ure to make sufficient progress; his views on whether this is prejudicial to good road safety; the statistics on the proportion of driving tests failed due to failure to make sufficient progress; and if he will issue an instruction to his Department's driver testers that any person driving at five miles per hour slower than a speed limit or at over 50 miles per hour on a road where the national speed limit applies may not be failed for the reason of failure to make sufficient progress.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy in relation to the proper planning and development of urban areas, of which the provision of green belts is part, is a matter to be determined by the elected members of the local authority through the development plan process and enforced through planning control. The Planning Acts provide that the development plan must contain objectives for preserving, improving and extending amenities. In general, I have no proposal to usurp this important function of local authorities.</P>
      <P>Nor would I accept that it is necessary for me to do so to facilitate the servicing of land for residential development. The integration of land use planning and the efficient provision of infrastructure in the major cities is/will be assisted by the preparation of strategic planning documents such as the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, published last week, and the land use and transportation studies in the case of Cork, Limerick and Galway.</P>
      <P>Local authority boundaries should not in themselves be a barrier to the efficient servicing of lands. It is not uncommon for schemes sponsored by one local authority to service land in an adjoining local authority. Agreements under the City and County Management Acts are usually put in place to ensure effective implementation. Under the Local Government Act, 1991 it is open to any individual local authority to adopt a proposal to alter its boundary.</P>

      <P>Local authorities, through their housing programmes, provide housing, including hostel type accommodation, for people who have been assessed as in need of housing and who are unable to provide it from their own resources. A <Col N="1514" /> capital allocation funding is provided annually for this purpose. However, my Department does not provide specific funding for the ongoing revenue costs of housing provided by local authorities. An adequate legislative framework already exists for the provision and management by local authorities of hostel-type accommodation.</P>
      <P>Local authorities do not, generally, provide foyer hostel type accommodation for young single persons. However, voluntary housing bodies have expressed interest in providing this type of accommodation for homeless young people with the benefit of capital funding made available by my Department under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme.</P>
      <P>I understand that Dublin Corporation are collaborating with the Cara Irish Housing Association in the provision of a 49 unit foyer development, for which a once-off additional provision of £1 million was made in the 1999 budget.

      <P>Designations under the new urban renewal scheme were based on integrated area plans, (IAPs), submitted by local authorities and were in line with recommendations made by an expert advisory panel which I established to assess all of the plans submitted.</P>
      <P>The IAPs were drawn up on the basis of detailed guidelines prepared by the expert panel and issued to local authorities. These guidelines made it clear that, in selecting areas for the preparation of IAPs local authorities were to give priority to areas in cities and towns with strong urban characteristics and high concentrations of physical decay and socio-economic disadvantage. Ballyshannon and a number of other small towns were not considered by the panel to meet these criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations made by the panel, which exercised an independent role, were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designation is now being implemented. There is no proposal to designate further areas under the new urban renewal scheme. The expert panel found also, however, that many of the smaller towns not recommended for designation, contained a significant amount of urban townscape which had or was in danger of deteriorating badly. A proposed new townscape restoration <Col N="1515" /> scheme is aimed at restoration and conservation of townscapes in smaller towns. Local authorities will be asked to consider the submission of urban townscape plans by 1 August next, in accordance with guidelines being prepared to assist them in preparing plans for the new scheme to be introduced in the autumn. It will be a matter for Donegal County Council to consider the submission of a plan for Ballyshannon.</P>

      <P>Implementation of the licensing system, including detailed assessment of the potential environmental impact of licensable activities, is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>A waste licence may not be granted by the agency unless it is satisfied that:</P>
      <P>any emission from the activity concerned will comply with any relevant standard or emission limit value, the activity concerned will not cause environmental pollution, the best available technology not entailing excessive costs will be used to minimise emissions, the applicant (if he or she is not a local authority) is a fit and proper person to hold a waste licence, and the applicant can discharge all financial commitments and liabilities likely to arise from the licensed activity.</P>
      <P>The agency must provide for public access to all relevant documentation and information, consult widely regarding licence applications and proposed licensing decisions, and have regard to any third party submissions or objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, while the agency is statutorily required to give a decision as expeditiously as possible the licensing process is necessarily intensive. I am satisfied that its focus should remain on ensuring a high degree of environmental protection in respect of waste activities, in a manner which attracts public confidence. I have no pro<Col N="1518" /> posals at this time to amend current waste licensing procedures.</P>

The role of landfill in future waste disposal in Ireland, and relevant policy advice for local authorities in that regard, are specifically addressed in the policy statement on waste management entitled Changing Our Ways, published in October 1998. A copy of the statement is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The decision on whether or not to grant planning permission for overhead power lines and systems, which are not exempted development, is a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Pleanála in the event of an appeal. In making such a decision the authority or the board is restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area, including the preservation and improvement of amenities, and regard must be had to the provisions of the development plan. Planning decisions frequently involve the balancing of different factors and the law places responsibility for this on the planning authority and An Bord Pleanála. I do not intend issuing planning guidelines requiring that power lines be placed underground. My Department is, however, preparing draft planning guidelines on high amenity landscapes to assist planning authorities in carrying out their planning functions, including assessing applications for overhead power lines and pylons.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing a scheme whereby elderly persons could obtain a dog licence at a reduced rate has been examined.</P>
      <P>While I recognise that a dog can provide both a sense of security and companionship for elderly people, it would not be feasible to introduce such a scheme without incurring substantial administrative costs. There would also be some loss of revenue for local authorities, who rely on income from dog licences to assist in financing their dog control activities.</P>
      <P>At a practical level also, such a scheme could give rise to difficulties in establishing the ownership of dogs in respect of which a reduced rate licence was paid but where the dog in question was being kept by a person who was not eligible for such a licence. Under section 6 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986 a dog licence may be transferred to any other person when possession, but not ownership, of the dog is transferred to such other person.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 24 March 1999, there is, at any one time, a range of working groups and committees involved in aspects of the Department's business. Many of these are set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to address particular issues and details are not available as to the number and nature of all of these.</P>
      <P>A number of groups, committees have been set up by the Department involving representatives of other agencies and bodies. These include the following: working group on women's access to labour market opportunities, small business users' forum, a business users' panel, steering committee for the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity, interdepartmental committee on the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, Interdepartmental Community Trust Working Group, Community Development Programme Advisory Committee, Community Development Programme Technical Group, National Advisory Committee on the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, Disability Consultative Forum, Interdepartmental Working Group on the Treatment of Married Cohabiting and One-Parent Households under the tax and social welfare codes, Interdepartmental Committee on an Integrated Social Services System, supplementary welfare allowance scheme &ndash; four working groups with the health boards on aspects of the scheme, programme evaluation working groups, the number of which varies from time to time.</P>
      <P>No unestablished civil servants were appointed in my Department in relation to such committees or groups. There is one special adviser to the Minister who has been appointed from the private sector. He is paid at the maximum point of the principal officer scale, currently £47,713 per annum exclusive of pension contribution. A personal secretary has been appointed at a net additional cost per year to the Exchequer of £860 and a personal assistant at a net additional cost per year to the Exchequer of £1,165. This compares very favourably with the regime of advisers etc. installed in this office during the Rainbow Government's time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no programme manager which means a cost saving to the Exchequer in respect of salary <Col N="1522" /> of about £46,000, quite apart from the attendant ancillary costs.</P>
    <P>Nor is there a five person policy unit in existence in my Department, something which was present prior to my coming into office in June 1997, at a salary cost saving of about £95,000, quite apart from the attendant ancillary costs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Consultancy Projects</i>In the engagement of the services of individual consultants and consultancy firms, officials of my Department follow standard procurement procedures, as set down in national and EU regulations.</P>

    <P>There are three statutory agencies reporting to the Department, namely the National Social Service Board, the Pensions Board and the Combat Poverty Agency. There is a range of subcommittees and working groups operating under the aegis of each of these, details of which were supplied in my reply of 24 March 1999.</P>

      <P>The question of the effective dates of any future increases in social welfare payments is a matter to be decided in a budgetary context having regard to the available resources and in the light of the Government's other priorities. In practice, final decisions on such matters are taken quite close to the date of their announcement on budget day.</P>
      <P>However, as a lead-in time of a number of months is needed to make the required legislative and administrative changes, e.g. enactment of the necessary social welfare legislation, printing of pension books etc. it would not be feasible for social welfare recipients to receive increases in their payments at the time of the budget announcement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258, 259, and 260 together.</P>
      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme, is to give an incentive to long-term unemployed persons who, in the absence of the scheme, would not be in a position to take up a job.</P>
      <P>The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted at people who need an additional incentive to return to the workforce. It is, therefore, a requirement of the scheme that an application must be made prior to taking up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> The person concerned commenced employment on 29 November 1998. He applied for the allowance on 19 January 1999. Under the rules of the scheme his application was refused as the claim was late and that he was in a position to return to the workforce without the need for the financial incentive which the scheme provides. There were no circumstances in this case which would justify any revision of this decision.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its inception a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1998 some 56,000 people had been assisted by the scheme. This means that since I came into office, this Government has spent £10 <Col N="1525" /> million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>An independent review of the scheme has been commissioned by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance and Health and Children, which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>The final report from the consultants will be published shortly. The future plans for the operation of the scheme in 1999 will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>
    <P>The views of many voluntary and community bodies on the scheme of community support for older people have already been requested by the consultants in developing the findings of the report. The consultants conducted a postal survey of 250 voluntary and community groups which received funding under the scheme in 1997. These groups were geographically spread in proportion to the overall spread of groups around Ireland. One the many questions asked of the groups in the survey was an outline of their proposal on the future of the scheme. In addition, a number of meetings were held with voluntary and community groups to supplement the survey.</P>

The maximum period of career break is five years and accordingly, at the end of five years, the options open to the person concerned were either to resume duty or to resign from the Civil Service. The person concerned did not respond to the communications from my Department outlining these options and, in accordance with normal practice in these cases, she was deemed to have resigned her Civil Service position.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the widow(ers) (contributory) pension scheme and the possibility of introducing a special 50 per cent pension similar to the recently announced 50 per cent old age (contributory) pension for certain people who were self-employed.</P>
      <P>This special old age (contributory) pension is being introduced to address the position of those self-employed people who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 when compulsory social insurance was extended to the self-employed. This group failed to qualify for a pension under the standard qualifying conditions as they did not satisfy the general requirement of having entered social insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> The new pension will be paid to those who were 56 years of age or over in April 1988 and who have, at least, five years reckonable contributions paid since then. It will be paid at a flat rate of 50 per cent of the standard, maximum rate. Increases for adult and child dependants, where applicable, will also be payable at 50 per cent of the standard rate.</P>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for the widow(ers) (contributory) pension are already more flexible than those for the old age (contributory) pension. For instance, to satisfy the yearly average condition, a widow(ers) entitlement may be based on either the full social insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years. A widow, or widower, may qualify on either their own or their late spouse's insurance records; in addition, social insurance contributions paid or credited under the National Health Insurance Acts since 1936 may be used to satisfy the requirement that 156 contributions are paid.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I have no plans, at present, to introduce any further changes in the contribution conditions. Any changes would involve additional costs and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Provision was made in the 1999 budget for payment of further arrears of pension in the case of certain late claims. Under these measures, the person concerned was awarded further arrears of pension amounting to £761.60 which were paid to him in December last.</P>
      <P>Further arrears of pension could only be paid if the late claim is due to Departmental error, to incapacity which prevented the person claiming in time or to force majeure or where there is current financial hardship.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to maternity benefit is that the woman's employer must certify that she is entitled to maternity leave under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994. Accordingly, entitlement to maternity benefit is contingent on the woman's entitlement to maternity leave.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, a pregnant worker is entitled to 14 weeks maternity leave from her employer, at least four of which must be taken immediately before the baby is due and four weeks immediately after the baby is born. The balance of six weeks can be taken at the woman's discretion. However, this 14 week maternity leave period can be extended, in certain limited circumstances, for up to a further four weeks where the baby is born late. This is to ensure that the woman is always entitled to at least four weeks maternity leave in the period immediately after the baby is born.</P>
      <P>As the duration of payment of maternity benefit is generally linked to this maternity leave period, maternity benefit is not, therefore, paid during periods for which a woman is not entitled to maternity leave.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, in the case raised by the Deputy, where the baby is born prematurely, the maternity benefit claim is put into payment with effect from the date of birth of the child. Although she had not taken the normal four weeks leave before the birth of her child, the woman still qualifies for the payment of maternity benefit for the full 14 weeks duration. However, there is no facility under current legislation within which the period of maternity leave and consequently the period of maternity benefit can be extended on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the 1994 Maternity Protection Act provides women with the option of <Col N="1529" /> taking up to four weeks unpaid &ldquo;additional maternity leave&rdquo; following the exhaustion of their ordinary maternity leave entitlement. Furthermore, under the terms of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, the woman in question could avail of part or all of her 14 weeks parental leave entitlement following exhaustion of her maternity leave entitlement, subject to prior approval from her employer. The child's father is also separately entitled to 14 weeks parental leave.</P>
    <P>I am already aware of the problems relating to entitlement to maternity benefit in cases such as that raised by the Deputy and, indeed, in other similar cases where, for instance, a baby is born with a serious illness. However, as these matters also concern the woman's entitlement to maternity leave in the first instance, I will be bringing them to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of the review which he is carrying out arising from the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium for the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation.</P>
    <P>I should point out that any proposals to extend the duration of entitlement to maternity benefit would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources.</P>

      <Quest>the number of applications received by tender for development of the National Folklife Museum at Turlough Park House, Castlebar, County Mayo; if the tenders have been examined; when she will make an announcement regarding the successful bid; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am advised by the Office of Public Works that eight tenders were received for the development at Turlough Park House. These tenders have been assessed and the necessary procedures for the placing of a contract are now being followed.</P>
      <P>I expect to make a formal announcement on the development of the new museum and the successful bid soon when the normal contractual issues and details of the subcontracts have been finalised.</P>
      <P>I think it is important in the first instance to record the significant support, both financial and otherwise that has been provided to this project by Mayo County Council. This project has been brought forward by my Department, the National Museum of Ireland and the Office of Public Works with the active support and co-operation of the County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the National Folklife Museum at Turlough Park House which is being part-funded under the Operational Programme for Tourism within the European Regional <Col N="1530" /> Development Fund will provide a prestigious new purpose-built facility in which to display to the Irish people and to tourists the National Museums folklife collection which up to now has been in storage and not accessible by the public. I expect that the new museum will be a major visitor attraction and will generate substantial economic benefits for Castlebar and its hinterland and the region generally.</P>

      <P>With regard to the matter of advisory committees, groups, etc, I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 333 of 25 Samhain 1998 and 151 of 24 Márta 1999.

      <P>With regard to consultants, I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 349 of 30 Meitheamh 1998 and 297 of 2 Feabhra 1999. The Deputy will note that the consultancies (excluding some low cost consultancies, generally involving expenditure not exceeding £5,000 each) were placed as a result of competitive tendering and, in that context, publication of the costs involved would be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>With regard to unestablished civil servants appointed in my Department, I assume, from the context of the question, that the Deputy is referring to such staff employed in my office and that of the Minister of State at my Department. Relevant details are as follows:&ndash;</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department was notified last November by Sligo County Council of an application for outline planning permission in respect of the matter raised by the Deputy. Because of the proximity of the site to a ringfort which is protected under the National Monuments Acts, 1930-94, Dúchas, when replying to the County Council in December last, requested that an assessment of the proposed development be prepared by an archaeologist. This assessment was subsequently carried out.</P>
      <P>The assessment report was received only recently by Dúchas who concurs with its recommendation in the report that their should be monitoring of all ground disturbance works in the southern part of the development site by a qualified archaeologist, in view of the closeness of the ringfort feature. Subject to archaeological monitoring being made a condition of planning permission, Dúchas has no objection to the proposed development now proceeding and has conveyed this recommendation formally to Sligo County Council.</P>

      <Quest>if an archaeological report will be carried out on a site (details supplied) in County Sligo before planning permission is granted in view of the fact the proposed development will interfere with and destroy significant archaeological features which are treasures and of major archaeological importance and interest the remains of which are clearly evident on site; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>An application for planning permission for a housing development has been referred by Sligo County Council to Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department in view of the fact that the development site encompasses a ringfort which is included in the Record of Monuments and Places for County Sligo and is thus protected under the National Monuments Acts, 1930-94.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this monument has already been impinged upon in the past with the construction of a public road along its north-eastern perimeter, Dúchas are seeking to ensure that its setting is not compromised further by the current proposed development. It is therefore recommending to the planning authority that no groundworks should take place within 30 metres of the external per<Col N="1532" /> imeter of the ringfort and that, as a condition of planning permission, all ground disturbance works should be archaeologically monitored. These combined recommendations are considered adequate to ensure that archaeological features will not be destroyed as a result of this development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 and 276 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has approved a proposal submitted to it by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to the restructuring of the Board of Údarás na Gaeltachta. The Údarás na Gaeltachta (Amendment) Bill, 1999, which will be published as soon as possible after Easter will provide for the giving of legislative effect to this and other proposals in relation to an tÚdarás. The Bill will specifically provide for an increase in the number of constituencies for the purposes of elections to Údarás na Gaeltachta and for an increase in the number of elected members of an tÚdarás. I am satisfied that the proposals in this regard will meet the demands of Gaeltacht communities for increased representation on the board of an tÚdarás and that this increased elected representation will contribute to addressing the needs of Gaeltacht communities in general and as a result to maintaining and promoting the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>As regards membership on the board of an tÚdarás of a representative of the staff of an tÚdarás this is not being proposed in the Bill. I would also like to point out that, although Ministers have in the past appointed staff members as Ministerial nominees, Údarás na Gaeltachta did not come under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977. Deputies will have the opportunity of putting forward their views on the proposals in the Bill when it comes before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision on deportation of non-nationals was found to be unconstitutional by the High Court in the <i>Laurentiu</i> case. Therefore, at present there is no power to deport a person no matter what offence they may have committed.</P>
      <P>The Immigration Bill, 1999, which is advancing through the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides powers, principles and procedures regarding the deportation of non-nationals. Given the Deputy's evident concern, which I share, that there should be the option of deporting persons who have committed offences, including sexual offences, I look forward to the support of his party for the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997 introduced criminal sanctions for persons found guilty of the offence of harassment which is aimed at what is commonly called &ldquo;stalking&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This new offence created by the 1997 Act carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. A person will be guilty of this offence if he or she, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse by any means, harasses another by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with the victim so as to seriously interfere with that person's peace and privacy or to cause alarm, distress or harm to the person. This provision is of general application and applies to private investigators as well as to others.</P>
      <P>The court is also empowered under this legislation to order the stalker not to communicate in any way with the victim for such period as may be specified by the court or to approach within such distance as the court shall specify of the place of residence or employment of the victim. Breach of such a court order will be an offence and the maximum penalty here is also seven years</P>
      <P>imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to review the law in relation to harassment.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Government has approved my proposal to give effect to recommendations contained in the report of the consultative group on the private security industry for establishment of a statutory framework for regulation of the industry. The proposal now forms part of the Government's legislation programme.</P>
      <P>Work on the heads of legislative proposals is at a preliminary stage in my Department but it is my intention to have the details of the legislation developed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I have outlined to the House on previous occasions that my Department is responsible for funding elements of the statutory response to the issue of violence against women. As the Deputy may be aware my Department funds the running costs of the national steering committee on violence against women, which is chaired by Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State and it is responsible for funding programmes and facilities to deal with perpetrators. Recently the Department has provided funding for research projects on topics related to the work of the national steering committee.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of services for victims of violence, the House will be aware that funding for these services is made available to the various organisations through the health boards and the Department of Health and Children. The Minister for Health and Children has made available, in 1999, an additional £1 million to bring the total spend by the health boards this year to almost £5 million.</P>
      <P>I would also like to remind the House that there are now regional committees on violence against women operating in each of the health board areas whose remit is to provide a cohesive and multi-disciplinary response to victims. The committees are analysing existing services, identifying gaps in provision and developing plans to address the needs which have been identified.</P>

      <P>Section 16(d) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation, although the statutory conditions for naturalisation, or any of them, are not complied with &ldquo;where the applicant is married to a naturalised Irish citizen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the same Act provides that a non-national may, following three years marriage to an Irish citizen, who is Irish otherwise than by naturalisation, honorary citizenship or by post nuptial citizenship, make a declaration of Irish citizenship as his or her post nuptial citizenship.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 10 March 1999 an examination of the Children Bill undertaken by Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, included an appraisal of juvenile justice systems in other countries and of developments and advances in the juvenile justice area since the Bill was published in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of that appraisal involved the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, accompanied by officials from my Department and the Department of <Col N="1541" /> Health and Children, visiting, New Zealand in the autumn of last year to study at first hand that country's system of juvenile justice. New Zealand has an international reputation for innovative approaches in this area. That visit and follow-up contact with the New Zealand authorities has been particularly beneficial in terms of work on improving and updating the Bill.</P>

      <P>While all applications received under the new sports capital programme will be treated on their merits, special priority will be given to proposals for facilities in disadvantaged areas, in line with Government policy aimed at increasing participation in these areas.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions for the new programme provide that grant aid up to a maximum of 70 per cent of the total project cost may be allocated in the case of local projects. Where such local projects are located in disadvantaged areas they may be funded up to a maximum of 80 per cent.</P>
      <P>Disadvantaged areas are defined as those areas which have been designated under the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development 1995-99, and are appended to the guidelines for the new sports capital programme which issued with the application forms.</P>
      <P>Other factors such as equity in the spread of funding on a geographical basis and among different sports and community groups will also be taken into account in determining grant allocations. The detailed criteria to be applied in assessing applications are set out in the guidelines for the new programme.</P>
      <P>Almost 1,900 applications were received by the closing date of 12 February 1999 and these are being examined and assessed at present. Given the large number of applications received and the level of work involved in evaluating them, I do not expect to be in a position to make final announcements on the 1999 round of grant allocations for some time yet.</P>

      <P>The school transport scheme was designed to provide a basic level of service for children in rural areas who, if living a long distance from their nearest school, might have difficulty in attending regularly. My Department strives to maintain this basic level of service, while at the same time achieving optimum value from scarce resources. However, the cost of the scheme increases each year, with rising operational costs and constant demand for the extension of existing routes and the establishment of new services.</P>
      <P>My Department has no transport arrangements in place where suitable public scheduled services already exist. In urban areas schools are closer to pupils' homes and accordingly, fewer pupils qualify for transport under the terms of the scheme. Where pupils in cities are eligible under the terms of the scheme and reside within the range of public scheduled transport, they are issued with term tickets on those services.</P>
      <P>The organisation of public scheduled services outside of Dublin is a matter for Bus Eireann, and for Bus Átha Cliath in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>To operate an urban school bus system for all pupils more than one mile from the school they attend would require a complete revision of school transport scheme. It would also have massive cost implications for the State and I have no plans to implement such a proposal.</P>

      <P>When the mother made inquiries of the clinical services of the health board, she was informed that there would be a long waiting time before appointments for speech therapy or psychological assessments could be offered. However, I understand that the health board has now arranged a speech therapy assessment for 31 March 1999.</P>
      <P>The young child attends one of the primary schools served by my Department's psychological service. He and his parents will be offered an appointment after the Easter holidays in order to discuss with the psychologist and teaching staff the findings from the speech therapy assessment so that remedial treatment may be arranged, if necessary.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that students, parents and teachers in all areas of the country should have ready access without any undue delay to the support of educational psychologists. The expansion of provision is one of my priorities as Minister. I shall shortly be establishing the National Educational Psychological Service Agency. As a first step in the implementation of this measure, my Department will shortly be recruiting 25 additional psychologists, who should take up their appointments during the school year 1999-2000. It is envisaged that, at the end of the five year period, every school in the country will have access to an educational psychological service.</P>

The only reasonable position that the Department can adopt is that, once entered by a particular school, a student must take his or her examinations in a centre in that school. Where a school raises such an issue my Department may exercise some flexibility in exceptional circumstances e.g. illness.</P>
      <P>In the case of the candidates referred to by the Deputy the position is that the examinations branch of my Department has not received any communication in relation to this matter from the schools that entered the candidates for the examination.</P>

      <P>My announcement of November 1998, to which the Deputy refers, introduced a formalised arrangement under which all primary school children assessed as having special educational needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1554" /> The response in question may take the form of full-time or part-time resource teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs. Children with special needs attending ordinary primary schools on a fully integrated basis will particularly benefit from this new development. Already, as a result of this new development, in excess of 30 extra resource teachers and 150 child care assistants have been allocated to special needs children.</P>
    <P>I understand that the school to which the Deputy refers has made application to my Department for the appointment of a child care assistant. This application is currently being examined by my Department's inspectorate. A decision will be made on the matter very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the workload involved in dealing with a situation neglected for many years can cause some delays. This said, appointments of special supports for children are being made on an ongoing basis. This marks a considerable breakthrough from the policy which previously prevailed.</P>

      <Quest>the policy of his Department on the support of the method of conductive education as pioneered by the Peto Institute in Hungary; and the level of support provided for conductive education by his Department.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Conductive education is a system of education for children and adults with motor disorders. The system originated from the work of Andras Peto at the Peto Institute in Hungary in the 1940s. Under this system, the motor problems are regarded as learning difficulties to be overcome, rather than medical conditions to be treated. The aim of the method is for the individual to learn new ways to control movement and thus become independent. Treatment and edu<Col N="1555" /> cation is aimed at the whole personality rather than directed to the disability in isolation. The teacher (conductor) facilitates the learning process by helping the learners to solve their own problems and structure their own methods.</P>
      <P>The success rate claimed for conductive education derives from statistics supplied by the Peto Institute, supported by some anecdotal evidence, rather than being backed up by independent research evidence. The institute deems many pupils unsuitable for conductive education. Hence any success rate claimed is of limited value. Attempts to transport conductive education outside of Hungary have proved difficult because of differences between countries in social, political and educational climates.</P>
      <P>The results of several well controlled comparative studies have shown conductive education to be less effective than the traditional methods of teaching and therapy used in our special school system. There is at present not enough reliable evidence of the potential or achieved success of the conductive education method to justify diverting resources from our existing special education system to this highly specialised system.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme for the employment of secretaries which was introduced in 1978, my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI.

      <P>The student in question has been awarded the full adjacent rate of maintenance grant under the European Social Fund aided maintenance grant scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses in respect of her attendance at a PLC course in Gorey community school.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in the case of a grantholder whose normal residence is 15 miles or less from the PLC centre which she or he is attending. The non-adjacent rate of grant may be paid in all other cases.</P>
      <P>As the PLC centre is less than 15 miles from the student's normal residence, she can only qualify for the adjacent rate of grant. There is no provision in the scheme for payment of the non-adjacent rate in exceptional circumstances such as those outlined in this case.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied to my Department for inclusion in the home-school-community liaison service.</P>
      <P>My immediate priority in this area is to extend the home/school/community liaison service to all first and second level schools which have been designated as disadvantaged and which currently do not have access to the liaison service. Arrangements to put this extension of service in place from September next are currently being made in my Department.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the event of any further expansion of the home-school-community liaison scheme being undertaken.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to introduce legislation to strengthen the vocational education sector and that this will provide for the representation of parents on vocational education committees. In finalising legislative proposals I am consulting with the relevant stakeholders in the sector, including parents, and I am giving their views careful consideration. As I have indicated previously, it will not be possible that the new statutory provision will be in place before the local elections, which will take place next June. I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill in mid 1999.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure, and in view of the pending legislation, my Department will be in contact with local authorities with a view to encouraging them to exercise their powers so as to ensure an appropriate representation of parents on vocational education committees after the next local elections. I intend also that the provisions in the amending legislation with regard to representation on vocational education committees will be implemented from a current date when enacted.</P>
      <P>My Department has engaged in very useful discussions with the National Parents' Council on this matter and the legislative proposals generally.</P>

      <P>My Department's support for children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia, is generally focused on in-school services. The educational needs of such pupils are normally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the support, where appropriate, of the remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. There are currently 1,302 remedial teachers in place in the primary system and a further 350 such teachers in the second level system.</P>
      <P>I recently announced my intention to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second level schools with effect from September next. Arrangements to put this extension of service in place are currently being made in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary <Col N="1563" /> classes. In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools and seven special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
    <P>In 1998 my Department allocated a sum of £38,111 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities, ACLD, to assist its administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas. In the current year, an allocation of £50,000 is being made available to the ACLD.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major new development in special education services under which all primary school children with special educational needs will have an automatic right to a response to those needs. The response in question may take the form of additional teaching or child care support, or both, depending on the specific needs of the child. Children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia, are entitled to benefit from this development.</P>
    <P>My Department will shortly be issuing a detailed circular and information note advising all primary schools of the procedures to be followed in seeking support under this new development in special education services.</P>

      <P>The student in question originally applied to County Kildare Vocational Education Committee in September 1997 for a scholarship in respect of the 1997-98 academic year. It was not noticed at the time that the course on which he was embarking was not due to commence until January, 1998 and spanned only two terms of that academic year. County Kildare VEC inadvertently paid three instalments of maintenance to the student whereas he should only have been paid two instalments. When it came to the VEC's attention that the student had been overpaid for the 1997-98 academic year, the VEC alerted the student and an agreement was reached between the parties that only two instalments of maintenance would be paid for the 1998-99 academic year although the course spanned three terms of that year. The first instalment was paid in December, 1998 and the final instalment is due for payment in April 1999.</P>
