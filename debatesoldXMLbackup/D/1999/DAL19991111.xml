        <b>: </b>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent importance: the chaotic conditions in our prison system where five suicides have occurred in the past year, the threatened action by prison officers at Mountjoy Prison, that the new prison at Clover Hill and the women's prison at Mountjoy have not opened, and the failure to introduce a variety of effective alternatives to custody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inquire about the promised Prison Service Bill. Prison officers in Mountjoy will meet at 1 p.m. today. What arrangements has the Government put in place lest the officers decide to take action over their concerns about over-crowding in the prison? Has the Government alerted the Army in case it is <Col N="1062" /> needed, given that there was a near riot in Portlaoise Prison in recent days? When will the Prison Service Bill be introduced so that we will know who is taking responsiblity for our prisons? At present, when it suits him, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, sends the prison director to deal with the builders in Clover Hill, so he is not taking control of the situation.</P>

      <P>In the list of promised legislation it is indicated that the Prison Service Bill will not come before the House until well into next year. In light of the facts put before the House by Deputy Owen, that the number of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison last night was more than double the recommended capacity, that two prisons were officially opened by the Minister, one of which is the women's prison where prisoners&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy was in office for two and half years but she did not do much about this situation.

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask about the Attachment of Earnings Bill. At present, 2,500 people go to prison for short periods but they take up spaces. Why has the Government not introduced the Attachment of Earnings Bill so that people fined in the courts can have an alternative means of paying fines rather than taking up places in our prison system? This legislation was promised by the Government but it has failed to introduce it. Where is the Attachment of Earnings Bill and the indexation of fines Bill? Implementation of this legislation would help to relieve overcrowding in Mountjoy which currently holds 782 people &ndash; well over 100 more than its capacity.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="1068" /> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Good copyright legislation is essential for the health of the modern Irish economy. This form of intellectual property law is, perhaps, most usually thought of as applying to books and other literary forms. In reality, it is the primary means of legal protection for a wide range of works. Musical, dramatic and artistic works are covered by copyright, as is computer software, which is included in the category of literary works for copyright purposes. Films are also protected by copyright as are photographs. In addition to works protected by primary copyrights, important economic interests are protected by secondary copyrights, most notably sound recordings, which includes the recorded music industry. In recent years, new forms of protection have been developed out of copyright. These include specific protections for the rights of performers and rights in databases.</P>
      <P>This simple listing of the scope of copyright protection should be enough to show the importance of a fully functional copyright and related rights law for the functioning of any modern economy. Unfortunately, this importance is not really reflected in current Irish legislation. The last comprehensive reform of Irish copyright law was the Copyright Act, 1963. This Act was itself heavily based on the United Kingdom Copyright Act, 1956. When we consider the extraordinary development of the means for the creation, storage and transmission of copyright works in the period since then, it is obvious that this situation must be unsatisfactory. There have been some reforms, most importantly, in the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998. It remains true, however, that Ireland has arrived at the end of the 20th century with a copyright law drafted in an age when computers occupied whole buildings, telecommunications were still substantially based on manual switching and, when it came to filing and record-keeping, no alternative existed to papers files and the card index. The home video recorder had yet to reach our shores and even effective photocopying was a thing of the future. It is clearly a time to ready Irish copyright law for the new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill represents, perhaps, the most significant milestone yet in a programme of intellectual property law reform in which, to their credit, successive recent Governments and bodies of legislators have tackled the mammoth task of modernising this area of our law. This started with the Patents Act, 1992, and continued with the enactment of the Trade Marks Act, 1996. The Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, brought about badly needed improvements to the Copyright Act, 1963, in relation to remedies for copyright rightsholders for infringement of copyright and, in the criminal sphere, for penalties on conviction for copyright offences. The final stage in this programme will be a new Bill providing for the protection of industrial designs. <Col N="1069" /> This Bill, which I intend to bring before the House next year, will replace legislation which, after all this time, is still based on the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>Ireland is well along the road to having in place a modern, effective, efficient regime of protection for intellectual property rights in general, one with which we may meet, with confidence, the challenges of the new millennium. The Government is solidly committed to ensuring the neglect of former years will not be repeated and that the expertise and resources required to maintain our intellectual property laws in good order will be provided.</P>
    <P>One aspect of our copyright reform programme that has been the subject of some comment is its relation to Ireland's obligations under European Community and international copyright law. Current Irish copyright law has been the subject of complaint from our European partners and from our international trading partners in general, on the basis that Ireland has failed to take on board a number of promised copyright reforms required by European and international law in due time. The obligations concerned include those contained in a number of European directives as well as international commitments entered into under the Berne Convention on the Protection of Artistic Works and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or the TRIPs Agreement. It has been suggested we are only bringing forward this long needed reform now as a result of international pressure. I wish to make clear that neither the Government nor its recent predecessors should make any excuse for the inaction on copyright reform over many years. This was inexcusable. It must, however, be recognised that there has been a great quickening of interest in intellectual property law in the last decade. This development was in line with increasingly rapid changes in the information economy in that period. It is entirely to the credit of successive Irish Governments and bodies of legislators in that period that they have done their level best within the limited resources available to respond to this. The establishment in 1992 of the intellectual property unit in my Department and the record of legislation, which I mentioned, clearly indicate the seriousness with which Ireland now views intellectual property matters.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, my Department has committed considerable time and effort to bringing forward a comprehensive programme of copyright reform, culminating in the Bill we are discussing here today. This Bill has resulted from extensive consultation between my Department and various copyright interests leading up to and following from the publication of the draft Copyright Bill in July of last year. This Bill sets out a modern and efficient copyright system at home and facilitates compliance with our obligations to our trading partners abroad. Ireland has no reservations about the need for strong international copyright protection in a world of communi<Col N="1070" /> cations without borders. This commitment is one of the foundations of this Bill. The House will no doubt be aware that the Bill has been welcomed by our European and international trading partners as well as the major copyright based industries. This suggests that the time taken to prepare the legislation was well spent.</P>
    <P>The principal objectives of the Bill may be summarised in four points: to put in place a modern, effective, efficient and technology neutral regime of statutory protection for copyright and related rights, including provision for civil remedies and criminal penalties fully sufficient to deter copyright theft, bearing in mind the economic and cultural consequences of such theft for the information society; to transpose into Irish law a number of EU directives in the field of copyright and related rights; to bring Irish law into conformity with all obligations incurred under international law on copyright and related rights, including the Berne Convention, the Rome Convention, the TRIPs Agreement, the World Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty, and Performances and Phonograms Treaty; and to provide, for the first time in Irish law, for tailor made regimes of civil protection for performers' rights, rights in performances and non-original databases in line with the best EU and international standards. Having prepared the text of the Bill with the greatest care, the Government is satisfied it will achieve these ambitious objectives.</P>
    <P>Part 1, on the preliminary and general, deals with certain technical and incidental issues, including interpretation of terms and the power of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make orders and regulations under the proposed legislation. Part II, on copyright, deals with the substantive provisions on copyright, including the traditional neighbouring rights of copyright in sound recordings, broadcasts, cable programmes and typographical arrangements of published editions of works. The main subjects addressed are the nature of copyright works and works in which copyright may be held to subsist; authorship of copyright works and the duration of copyright protection in the various classes of copyright work; the rights of a copyright owner in relation to a work, including the exclusive right to authorise the copying or reproduction and making available to the public or adaptation of the work subject to the provisions of this legislation; primary and second infringement of copyright; and the various exceptions to be provided for derogating from the absolute rights of the copyright owner in certain limited specific cases. These are, principally, the &ldquo;fair dealing&rdquo; exceptions in favour of research and private study, criticism and review of works and incidental inclusion of copyright material in another work. There are also limited exceptions in favour of educational and library and archival use as well as certain uses in public administration. This Part of the Bill also includes provision for moral rights; provisions governing deal<Col N="1071" /> ings in copyright interests, including assignment and licensing; and remedies for infringement of copyright interests and criminal offences and penalties in the area of copyright and related technical issues as well as a range of technical, incidental and subsidiary issues associated with copyright proper.</P>
    <P>Exceptions to copyrights and to related rights are legislative provisions which allow activities that would normally be regarded as restricted by copyright protection to be carried out without such restriction or the payment of copyright royalties in very particular circumstances. Exceptions may be of a substantive, policy nature or may be technical. Technical exceptions deal with such matters as incidental inclusion of copyright materials in other works. An example of incidental inclusion would be where a film is being made on Grafton Street and music can be heard being played from a record shop. In such a case, where there is no deliberate act on the part of the film maker to include that music in his or her film, the music is properly regarded as incidental in the film. Its inclusion does not give rise to any requirement on the part of the film maker to pay copyright royalties. This Bill contains a number of exceptions, technical and substantive, in relation to copyright and, in parallel, in relation to performers' rights, rights in performances and to the database right.</P>
    <P>The Government is convinced of the need for a specific range of exceptions. They are required for technical reasons, and as a small but important element in the process of balancing the interests of rightsholders with those of the users of protected materials. Exceptions must, however, remain strictly limited, principally for two reasons. Copyright and copyright royalties are not like taxes. They cannot lawfully be imposed or remitted by Government at will. They are property rights in much the same way as rights in the ownership of other classes of property and their status as such under Bunreacht na hÉireann has been recognised by the courts. Exceptions must remain very limited as Ireland's obligations under EU and international law place strict constraints on the scope for exceptions. Exceptions must be specific and limited and they must not interfere with the normal exploitation of copyright works. These restrictions severely limit Ireland's scope for enacting new exceptions or for broadening the exceptions already in existence under the Copyright Act, 1963. Discussions are ongoing in Brussels on a proposal for a new directive on copyright and related rights in the information society.</P>
    <P>Following Commission consideration of amendments proposed by the European Parliament, the text being considered would restrict copyright exceptions in the Community to a narrow, closed list. Ireland would be far from agreeing with the extremely restricted scope for exceptions to copyright allowed by the text now under discussion. However, the Government feels the <Col N="1072" /> general principle of strictly limited exceptions emerging from the negotiations to date needs to be borne in mind in our current legislative endeavour. For these reasons, the free disposal by law of copyright and related rights interests through the expansion of the scope or range of exceptions is not an option under the Constitution or under EU or international law. For this reason, the Government rejects any suggestion that the exceptions proposed in the Bill as it stands be expanded.</P>
    <P>Part III on rights in performances provides for a regime of rights, exceptions and sanctions in respect of performers' rights and rights in performances. This is broadly parallel to those provided for in relation to copyright by Part II. The rights protected under this Part may broadly be described as the exclusive right of a performer to authorise the copying or making available to the public of his or her performance and recording rights. Recording rights involve the rights of persons who have exclusive recording contracts with performers, such as record producers, to protection from illicit recording. Part III represents the introduction into Irish law for the first time of a comprehensive regime of protection for this type of right. This includes direct legal protection for performers and producers against illicit direct recording of live performances, that is, what is often described as bootlegging.</P>
    <P>Part IV on performers' moral rights provides for a regime of moral rights protection for performers in relation to their performances which is parallel to that provided for authors of copyright works under Part II. Performers' moral rights are afforded a separate Part because they apply to performers' rights only. The concept of moral rights is not applicable to recording rights. Consequently, the incorporation of performers' moral rights in Part III could have posed serious technical drafting problems.</P>
    <P>Part V on databases provides for a new regime of protection for non-original databases as required by the EU database directive. Non-original databases are databases the creation of which does not involve significant intellectually creative input. Examples are simple alphabetical lists, such as telephone directories. These would have been protected up to now under Irish law by copyright as literary works. However, the database directive requires that a higher standard of originality be applied to databases if they are to qualify for full copyright protection. This Part will provide a more limited form of protection for databases no longer meeting the copyright originality standard in line with the rules set out in the database directive.</P>
    <P>Part VI on the jurisdiction of the controller makes provision for and expands the role of the controller of patents, designs and trade marks as a tribunal for the resolution of certain disputes regarding copyright licensing schemes. Part VII on technological protection measures provides copyright rightsholders with rights and remedies against persons who unlawfully circumvent tech<Col N="1073" /> nological measures designed to protect certain copyright materials. An example of this would be producing counterfeit smart cards for tapping into encrypted satellite broadcasts and cable programmes. Another example is the removal of identifying rights management features, such as digital fingerprints and other electronic markers, from copyright materials.</P>
    <P>Mention of technological protection measures prompts the question of whether the Bill contains measures specifically designed to address the challenges posed by the information society, such as the Internet. The Bill is designed in so far as possible to be technology neutral. It is drafted to accommodate the demands of the information age in the copyright field in a flexible and adaptable way.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provisions relating to technological protection measures, some specific provisions are worth noting. For example, the Bill generally replaces the concept of publication of a work with that of making available to the public. This removes any doubt that situations of passive publication, such as placing material on Internet websites, fall within the scope of copyright law. The Bill also contains 'notify and take down' provisions. These provide that if copyright infringing material is being carried on a service, such as an Internet service, and the rightsowners inform the service providers that infringing material is being carried on that service, the service providers will be obliged to remove that material as soon as is practicable. If the service provider fails to do this, he or she will also be held liable for that infringement. The Bill explicitly deals with representations of works. This will ensure that digital representations of works are properly covered by copyright law.</P>
    <P>These examples show the Government's determination to address specific copyright problems associated with new technologies, as well as providing a strong general legislative environment for the protection of copyright and related rights in the information age.</P>
    <P>I trust I have shown the vital importance of effective and efficient copyright and related rights legislation for the health of our economy and society in the information age. This is an important step in a major programme of commercial law reform which is already well on the way to rectifying the evils of past neglect of intellectual property law. As we enter the new millennium, the enactment of this Bill will move our copyright law from its present backward state to one fully capable of meeting the demands of the information age. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Much work has been done on the Bill, which has been described as one of the largest Bills to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I acknowledge the detailed work done by the officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and by our colleagues in the Seanad on this formidable legis<Col N="1074" /> lation. I welcome the fact the Minister of State made available a draft copy of the Bill at an earlier stage and I acknowledge the hard work he has done. I wish him well in his task of shepherding this Bill through the Dáil. We will do our best to challenge a number of aspects of the Bill on Committee and Report Stages and I look forward to debating the issues with him.</P>
      <P>We are updating legislation which has not been altered since 1963. This legislation is technical and complex. It has taken many officials a number of years to compile. I am sure the Minister of State would be the first to acknowledge the support of an army of civil servants when drafting and debating legislation. Perhaps the Civil Service believes the army is not big enough.</P>

      <P>It is doing the job of an army.</P>
      <P>It is the job of an Opposition to enter into constructive debates with Ministers to challenge certain points so that the legislation which finally emerges will be the best possible that can be presented as law. However, Opposition Deputies and backbench Government Deputies have little or no research facilities to assist them in this task. Much of our legislation is driven by our commitments to European Union Commission directives and international agreements and this legislation is no different. I am sure the Minister of State, who spent a short time in Opposition, would be one of the first to acknowledge that it is extremely difficult without research assistance to identify and debate points which need to be highlighted. This Bill is a clear example of technical and complex legislation which has international significance and importance. In other jurisdictions members of Parliament are allocated at least one technical research assistant to help with legislative work. Is it time to examine the possibility of doing something similar? </P>
      <P>Intellectual property is an expression of knowledge that is owned by someone. It consists of three areas &ndash; copyright, patent and trade marks and intellectual or trade secrets. We are all familiar with the fact that drugs can be patented and songs copyrighted. The growth of digital technology has pushed intellectual property into new territory. One could define intellectual property today as anything that can be sold in the form of one and zero. It is the primary product of the information age. As I listened to the Minister I thought he was about to say that he would boldly go where no man has gone before when he spoke about the Internet.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that one of the principal objectives of the Bill is to put in place a modern, efficient, effective and techologically neutral regime of statutory protection for copyright and related rights but technology is moving so quickly that we could be changing laws today to fit a tomorrow we can only guess at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 15th century Venice, as well as 16th century England, royalty grants for which certain authors <Col N="1075" /> and printers were given the exclusive right to publish books and other materials were issued. The purpose of these grants was not to protect authors' and publishers' rights but to raise government revenue and to give governing authorities control over publication content. The Statute of Queen Anne, passed in 1710, was a major event in the history of copyright law. It recognised for the first time that the primary beneficiaries of copyright should be authors. The idea of limited duration was introduced after which works would become published. Initially the period was set at 28 years. In 1741 similar laws were enacted in Denmark. The United States followed in 1790 and France in 1793. Copyright law was then developed in the 19th century in most western economies. It was not until 1852 that the idea of international protection came about. France extended protection of all its copyright laws to all authors regardless of nationality and this led to the Berne Convention in 1886. The primary provision of this convention is that each of the signatory countries provide automatic protection of works in other countries and for unpublished works whose authors are citizens or residents in such other countries.</P>
    <P>Copyright is an attempt to strike a balance between the needs of creators and the interests of the wider public. Growth in the book trade led to growth in libraries and this, in turn, led to the development of copyright libraries. Acts of Parliament required the delivery of copies of every book to a varying number of libraries. This idea spread from Britain to the United States where the Library of Congress was founded in 1800. The 18th century saw the development of commercial lending libraries and the 19th century of the free public libraries. Initially people were afraid that the availability of books would discourage people from purchasing copies for their own use but, in fact, the circulating libraries promoted rather than diminished the sale of books.</P>
    <P>Germany in the 18th century consisted of about 350 tiny states, each with its own laws. When writers published books in one jurisdiction printers in neighbouring states were free to copy the book and some actively encouraged this form of piracy. The sale of books rocketed but writers earned little. Some argued that piracy helped to keep the price of books down and that this benefited the public and helped the spread of ideas. There is a debate about whether or not it was right to restrict the flow of knowledge for writers' private gain. Kant, in 1797, said that every artistic work consisted of a physical object and a piece of its creator's spirit. He added that people could buy the object but not the spirit because the soul cannot be purchased. Thus writers can copy books freely but must respect the writer's integrity and this idea slowly grew into the current European system of copyright.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an attempt to update our copyright laws which have been based on the Copyright Act, 1963, with some amendments. While we <Col N="1076" /> have international agreements and treaties to abide by, we must be mindful of the parameters of our own Constitution when we enact laws and statutes in this jurisdiction. When the House discussed the forerunner to this Bill, the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998, some time ago, some of my colleagues and I raised questions regarding the constitutionality of that legislation. The Minister promised to subsume that legislation into the Bill which is before us today.</P>
    <P>In a submission made by the Irish Hotels Federation, the Irish nightclub industry association and the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the constitutionality of the presumptions in section 134 was questioned. The submission argued that these presumptions are not required by any international obligations taken by the State and it maintains that the section, like section 2 of the International Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, fundamentally alters the ordinary rules of evidence which apply in similar criminal proceedings. Section 134 has the effect that copyright is presumed to subsist in any work until the contrary is proved and that the plaintiff in any proceedings is presumed to be the owner and exclusive licensee of the copyright until the contrary is proved. On the other hand, rights holders are very strongly in favour of the presumptions contained in section 134. Difficulties have existed in the past in requiring collecting societies to present affidavit evidence from at home and abroad and to bring forward large numbers of witnesses, many from overseas, to face cross-examination on these affidavits.</P>
    <P>This issue will have to be teased out further on Committee Stage. I raise it now in order to request the Minister to give the matter some further thought and perhaps to give him a chance to hold meetings with interested groups. I welcome the agreement by the Minister and the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business to hold a special meeting where interested parties can debate this highly technical matter. Many people are only now beginning to realise how important this legislation is and how far reaching it will be. We are anxious that sufficient time be given on Committee Stage to debate amendments fully. To that effect we do not intend to prolong the second reading of the Bill.</P>
    <P>An important right has been omitted from the Bill. I understand that 11 of the 15 EU member states have on their statute books a right known as <i>droit de suite,</i> the artist's resale right. This is a major issue at EU level. The EU is committed to the ARR and the United States has said it will follow the EU lead. <i>Droit de suite</i> arises from the fact that visual artists work in originals and it is the originals that they sell. It allows them to receive compensation for the ongoing increase in value during the subsequent distribution of their creations when the works are sold on. This DDS gives a percentage of the sale price to the artist each time the work is resold. Otherwise all profits in the artist's work go elsewhere. The selling price <Col N="1077" /> of an artist's work usually increases after the death of the artist. The very act of dying increases the value.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Droit de suite </i>originated in France in the 1920s. At that time a poster was used showing two ragged urchins looking into a glitzy gallery window with the caption, &ldquo;Look, one of daddy's paintings&rdquo;. The idea was that the painting had increased dramatically in value while the artist who created it was getting nothing as a result of the increase. Old artists who are no longer able to work often live in very precarious financial situations while they can see their work selling for very large prices. This does not seem fair. Copyright has to do with rewarding creators. We have moral rights which preserve the intellectual relationship between the author and his or her work. Many arguments can be made in law for and against artists' resale rights. On balance, justice is on the side of the artists and I ask the Minister to examine this issue and to formulate an amendment to the Bill so that this right can be enshrined in our law.</P>
    <P>If the Minister decides to include this right he could study how well it works in Germany, France, Denmark or Spain, to mention a few of the EU countries where it works in different ways. At the single market council meeting held on 28 October, the question of the EU draft directive on this matter was removed from the agenda due to a lack of majority support. I understand that Ireland's position was to abstain on the question and this represents a softening of our Government's attitude because until now we have been against the directive. Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify this matter. I ask the Minister to do what he can to support DDS and to advance it at European level.</P>
    <P>When I began to study copyright issues in preparation for this debate I did not realise how important, complicated and all pervasive were the matters involved. There is an educational and information deficit in our society concerning copyright and intellectual property. Copyright, patents, trademarks, trade secrets issues and so on are unknown to many. Moral rights pertaining to database rights and so on are other important issues which the Minister referred to in his speech and which are included in the Bill. Measures should be put in place so that people are made aware of these issues and of their implications. It is possible that people are breaking the law without realising it. I realise that ignorance is no defence in law but the Minister should initiate an educational programme in schools and at every level to alert people to the rights of owners of copyright. People must be made aware that to breach copyright is to steal and could constitute a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>It is important that this vast and technical Bill be given ample time on Committee Stage. It is vital that committee members have time to study the points made at the forthcoming meeting of the joint committee and to formulate amendments. We must not rush the Bill. Many agencies <Col N="1078" /> have been studying it and because of its complexity and the changes that have been made since it was drafted we need time to examine the Bill in detail. Perhaps the Minister in his reply can let us know when he hopes the Bill will pass its final Stage. What kind of timetable has the Minister in mind for the Bill?</P>
    <P>Ireland has the third highest instance of software piracy. It seems that Ireland had the highest instance of it but recently we have been placed third. The rate has fallen from 65 per cent to 55 per cent behind the Greeks and the Spanish. It seems the economy is losing tens of millions of pounds in revenue and lost sales and job creation is affected also. A small number of retailers are selling PCs with software pre-installed. People are being ripped off because they are not supplied with licences, manuals or CDs. Many people are unaware of their rights when they buy computers. There is a need for education here and, wearing his hat as Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, perhaps Deputy Kitt could look at this new area of computers. It is important that people selling computers would be compelled to inform people of their rights. This is a provision under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Often people bring computers to be repaired to people who have just set up shop and when the repaired computer is returned they have no way of knowing what work has been done. The Minister should consider some form of certification, registration or licensing for computer repair outfits so that the consumer will know he or she will be dealing with a reputable and accountable organisation. That is a serious issue and I ask the Minister to take it on board. Using unlicensed software is stealing and there are dangers related to Y2K and virus infections.</P>
    <P>In the 1963 Act a clear distinction was drawn between the rights of composers to their music and the rights of record companies. Record companies get their profits and income principally from the sale of records. On the other hand the composer is totally dependent for his living on the exploitation of copyright. Equitable remuneration is at issue here. The current proposal gives record companies the same rights as composers. A 1996 Supreme Court decision stated that record companies are not entitled to royalties before the music is played. They are paid subsequently. The record companies see section 17 as the most important part of the Bill but others maintain that the section is not required by the TRIPs agreement. These are issues arising from ongoing concerns.</P>
    <P>There are reservations regarding the presumptions in section 134. For instance, will it be constitutional to presume criminality? That is an important issue. It is a vague grey area. After all the hard work which has gone into it, we do not want the Bill to be thrown out because of a constitutional difficulty. While the presumptions provided for in section 134 are of vital importance to the copyright owners, they would argue that section 122 serves to nullify the presumptions <Col N="1079" /> provided for in section 134. This is another issue on which I am sure we will get more information next week.</P>
    <P>The record companies are also concerned about what they see as a provision which, according to them, served to deny copyright owners revenue from any charitable event no matter what the scale or occasion. We must revisit this, especially if there is a danger that charitable events could be used to avoid paying copyright or other fees. Once off, occasional charitable events should be exempt. There is a problem here and I want to know how the Minister will balance those needs.</P>
    <P>Problems associated with transient or incidental copies have also been raised. The duration of existence of these copies could cause difficulty. I will return to this matter as it has to do with the Internet.</P>
    <P>With regard to hotels, does section 39(1)(d) mean that the infringement of copyright could occur where guests view televisions in hotel bedrooms and could this be extended to televisions and radios in public hospitals, prisons, etc.? There seems to be a problem with section 39(1)(d). I do not want to go into the detail of it. I am just flagging the issue so that the Minister will have time to look at it and report to us on Committee Stage. Will a licence fee have to be paid by the hotel or guesthouse owner for every television in the premises? Clearly if this is the case, it would have serious implications for the industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill is confusing where it deals with licensing bodies operating licensing schemes, as detailed in sections 144 to 149, as distinct from where it deals with licensing bodies which grant licences, as mentioned in sections 151 to 154. Section 166 provides for certification and licensing schemes. This is a most confusing section and perhaps the Minister would reconsider it. I have spoken to experts in the field who tell me that they cannot make sense of it. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us? Should we remove the distinction between schemes and licences to make the Bill simple and workable? Does the Bill demand that a licensing body obtain the consent of every rightholder? Is that practical? There are other issues regarding licensing to which I will return on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Government and Oireachtas copying seems to be strengthened in this Bill. We must examine this area carefully in the public interest and I will be most interested in the rationale behind this approach.</P>
    <P>The deposit of copyright material is also problematic. The Centre for Independent Living has been in touch with us concerning the availability of books in an electronic form for people with dexterity and sight problems. I understand the Bill provides for the provision of books in electronic form to deposit libraries but this is not clear. Perhaps we can look at that again. I want to flag that issue now. I know there are other related issues involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> I am sure the Minister is aware that there is also a difference of opinion concerning the ownership of copyright of work generated by in-house journalists. Journalists see the Bill as working to diminish copyright of staff journalists. They also maintain that attribution and integrity rights are akin to basic human rights and, therefore, cannot be waived. They argue that copyright in all European states apart from the UK cannot be held by an entity but must be held by a person. It seems that the only exception to this is where companies are formed by creators to collect and distribute royalties as a matter of convenience to the original creators. The NUJ quotes the universal declaration of human rights and the Berne Convention. The journalists also maintain that they object to section 23(2), which only allows authors in the course of employment by the proprietor of a newspaper or periodical to make use of the article for any purpose other than making it available to newspapers. The NUJ maintains that this provision is too restrictive. Journalists, it seems, are excluded under the Bill from paternity and moral rights of the work. Has the public the right to know who has written an article, taken a photograph or drawn a satirical cartoon? Has the public the right to know if such work has been altered or digitally manipulated in a context which violates the original meaning of the work? Are these essential freedoms? Should a journalist have the right to refuse to allow his or her work to be published in a newspaper which he or she finds unacceptable?</P>
    <P>Protection of sources is another important journalistic principle. It seems that libel law does not allow legal separation of a journalist and his or her work. Would this Bill mean that a journalist could be sued but that copyright would rest with the corporate entity?</P>
    <P>There are other points, such as the internationally recognised commercial rights of producers of intellectual property. In other areas the commercial exploitation of copyright is distributed equitably between its originator and distributor. On the other hand if a staff journalist is employed by a newspaper or television station, the employer, who is paying the wages, must be protected from the employee who would offer his or her work to someone else. I would be interested to know what happens in practice under the current legislation. Are employers losing out under the law? If not, why change it? Perhaps the Minister will look at that again. I would imagine that a contract would exist to prevent this activity and that breach of contract could lead to serious legal action and or termination of employment of the journalist who had infringed the contract.</P>
    <P>I can understand the objections of the newspaper owners also. They too must deal with electronic publications and the convergence of media. The national newspapers, while maintaining that their view is in line with the international situation, stress that in order to compete effectively in the modern age they must own the copyright of <Col N="1081" /> material generated by their in-house journalists in the same way that owners of competing information services do. They feel that section 23(2) should be deleted and they are at variance with the journalists on this point. I look forward to both groups debating their points before the joint committee shortly. I will not come down on any side until I have heard all the facts and teased out the issues.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation. We seek the provision of a great deal of time for Committee Stage in order to tease out the issues, many of which arose recently. I know many issues were dealt with in the Seanad, but people are only now beginning to recognise the importance of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I already referred to licensing schemes but there are also problems with the controller. The 1963 Act, for example, did not provide a speedy means of solving disputes relating to licensing schemes. Due to the lack of resources and expertise, the controller could not do his job properly. A method must be found to solve disputes quickly and simply. In other countries copyright tribunals have been established for that purpose. The registration of licensing bodies should be compulsory because such bodies could become very powerful if not regulated properly. A tribunal with the proper expertise and resources offers the best way forward in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with what are termed &ldquo;related rights&rdquo;. These include performers' rights and rights relating to databases. The Bill does not, however, indicate what constitutes &ldquo;substantial investment&rdquo; with reference to database rights. I have been asked to bring to the Minister of State's attention the fact that confusion exists concerning the transitional provisions contained in section 45 of the First Schedule. Again, this does not appear to make sense. It is vital that resources be made available to the controller or, as I would prefer, to a tribunal so that the performance of the powers and duties can be carried out properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to exemptions relating to the draft European directive on copyright. How can the free exemptions to copyright protection contained in the Bill be reconciled with the right to fair remuneration of the copyright owner contained in the draft information society directive? I welcome the Minister of State's indication that he intends to restrict a further narrowing of the restrictions and I wish him well in that regard.</P>
    <P>How will the controller determine the reasonableness of licensing schemes and should the Bill not contain guidelines in respect of this matter? How does the Minister of State square the length of retention of Government copyright with the Freedom of Information Act and transparency principles? Again, I refer here to the ownership position in respect of copyright on journalists' works.</P>
    <P>What is the Department's policy on exempting public institutions from the public lending right <Col N="1082" /> and what financial arrangements will be made to support public libraries, assuming they are not all to be exempt? Will the Minister of State explain why a distinction is being created between non-property rights and property rights for performers? This has no basis in international instruments.</P>
    <P>Why does the Bill refer to &ldquo;copying&rdquo; when all international EU instruments indicate that it should refer to &ldquo;reproduction&rdquo;? The term &ldquo;copying&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill. Questions also arise about the linking of an original work and a copy or reproduction of it. Is the Minister of State confident the Bill will implement the Internet infringement provision? Will it allow books to be electronically filed with libraries?</P>
    <P>The Bill is an extraordinarily complex item of legislation. It has far-reaching implications and it is not merely academic, it is highly practical. I congratulate the officials of the Department and the Minister of State for the hard work they invested in producing the Bill. Unfortunately, quite an amount of work remains to be carried out in respect of it. We will have to roll up our sleeves and get stuck in on Committee Stage. By working, co-operating and debating together, we will produce legislation which will, hopefully, see the Minister of State go boldly where no man has gone before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin by making a general point in favour of the Bill, namely, to say that if one is to have a copyright statute it should be comprehensive. I acknowledge that, from this point of view, the law in Ireland as it stands &ndash; as the Minister of State and Deputy Stanton indicated &ndash; is not comprehensive. One effect of the proposed enactment would be to make it so. For example, moral right is not provided for in existing Irish law but the Bill contains provisions to introduce the concept. Moral right is a right in law for an author of a work to be recognised as the author of that work. Associated with moral right is the right to object in law, in certain conditions, to derogatory treatment of a work.</P>
      <P>A second point is that the Bill is intended to transpose into domestic law a number of European Union directives. This is a pressing aspect of the Bill and I ask the Minister of State to provide further information on the question of proceedings against Ireland. Have such proceedings commenced or has the Commission decided to hold back on the basis that a speedy enactment of the legislation has been promised? This situation contains its own message, namely, how low down the list of priorities and status does the intellectual property unit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment lie?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall how, by way of panic reaction, it was proposed by officials of the Department that a remarkable emergency fast-track procedure might be used in the drafting of the Bill. The Bill was not developed in the most ideal circumstances. That is not a reflection on the officials concerned, but rather a comment on the Depart<Col N="1083" /> ment from the point of view of the effectiveness and appropriateness of its administrative standards and procedures. In that context, the Minister of State, in referring to how far we have fallen behind, said:</P>
    <P>I wish to make clear that neither the Government nor its recent predecessors should make any excuse for the inaction on copyright reform over many years. This was inexcusable.</P>
    <P>That may be true. However, it ought to be placed on record that the army of civil servants to which Deputy Stanton, in all honesty, referred, was never and I suspect is not now available. That makes its own comment on the status afforded to updating the law on intellectual property in the great scheme of managerial priorities within the Department.</P>
    <P>If Ireland was about to assume the Presidency of the European Union in the near future, one might find the officials most directly concerned with the drafting of the legislation were poached in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is beginning to sound like Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister of State referred to &ldquo;inexcusable&rdquo; behaviour, he ought to have been more pointed in laying blame where it should be laid.</P>
      <P>This matter gives rise to Deputy Stanton's point about the complexity, novelty and relevance of the legislation. How many colleagues on all sides of the House will contribute to the debate? The remarkable thing is that the Minister of State, as he did in the Seanad, is setting out the case for the legislation being a matter of life and death for our economy. If we had a debate on headage payments, one would find it difficult to obtain time to make a contribution. If the legislation is as important as the conventional wisdom in the Department has long held, as Deputy Stanton correctly pointed out, the low level of awareness about it is remarkable. The Bill was also drafted in inappropriate circumstances from a different point of view, as was mentioned during the Seanad debate on Committee Stage by Senator Feargal Quinn. He said, &ldquo;It is no secret that the Bill has been introduced in response to pressure, mainly from the United States&rdquo;. The Bill was in part driven by the commercial interests of the United States and the Federal Government acting on behalf of those interests through putting pressure on Ireland and making veiled and not so veiled threats. This was inappropriate behaviour, bordering on interference by a foreign Government in our internal affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn is right. In the Seanad the Minister mentioned that the Bill was of enormous significance from the points of view of commerce and culture. That is true but the Bill does not propose to strike an appropriate balance between commercial imperatives and cultural require<Col N="1084" /> ments. It would be going too far to say that this is purely commercial legislation but it is primarily commercial law entirely infused with the principles of such law. This is understandable given that the Bill emanates from a Department of a commercial nature. Given the nature of the measure in a broad context, however, that it pertains to a field that is both commercial and cultural, either it should have emanated on a joint basis from the two relevant Departments or it should be accompanied by a parallel cultural Bill or legislative measure. The reality is that the cultural side has been relegated.</P>
    <P>Culture in this context has broad meaning. It extends to spheres such as education and other aspects of public policy. There was an attempt during the lifetime of the rainbow Government by a collecting society to lumber primary schools with rights payments in the most inappropriate circumstances &ndash; the use of recorded music for fund-raisers and school discos. The attempt was strongly resisted by the then Government. The collecting society was faced down and it abandoned its plan. That caused quite a skirmish. The then Minister was advised by civil servants that this was in breach of the law, not necessarily civil servants concerned with intellectual property but at assistant secretary level. The Minister said, &ldquo;Thank you very much for the advice but I have taken this decision&rdquo;. The Civil Service faithfully implemented that decision. The Bill now produced will give the green light to this type of antisocial and anti-cultural behaviour. It is a matter of balance and it was not acceptable for IMRO, the organisation at that time, to attempt what it sought to do. How that conforms with the detail of the law on intellectual property is a secondary consideration.</P>
    <P>A point that is repeatedly laboured by the proponents of this Bill is that it is vital to the information age and the creation of an information society in Ireland. I accept that the law has not kept pace with various developments but we are not alone in that respect. Almost every country in the world faces pressure to update and adapt copyright law and the law on intellectual property in general. The fact that we are so far behind in amending our domestic legislation might prove to be an advantage. The process of drafting this new Act coincides with a major moment in history for the operation of intellectual property as a result of the emergence of the information society. How we all handle the amendment of intellectual property legislation will have a major influence on what the information society will come to mean for us all, who will benefit and the extent to which society will gain from it.</P>
    <P>It is contended that the information cannot function and will be delayed without the measures contained in the Bill. The Bill, it should be noted, proposes a maximalist intellectual property regime. It is said that this is necessary if the software sector is to thrive and employment is to be created. This point of view should be taken with a large pinch of salt. There is a strong culture <Col N="1085" /> and developed tradition, particularly in the Internet community, of ignoring, even outlawing the use of intellectual property law. There are some cogent proponents of this philosophy and some good examples of how beneficial from an economic point of view such a philosophy can be.</P>
    <P>One famous example of this is the Scandinavian computer programmer, Linus Torvalds, and his Linux operating system. Linux seems now to be reaching the point of critical mass. It may be about to take off. The system is widely available and it is free. The new applications are flowing from the software industry, applications which are also free. Leading computer manufacturers are now shipping machines with Linux pre-installed alongside Windows. Some manufacturers are even shipping with only Linux installed. The great strength of Linux is that it is free to everyone and is based on the core operating system that dominates the Internet, UNIX.</P>
    <P>Another prominent proponent of the open source approach to computing is Eric S. Raymond whose book <i>The Magic Cauldron</i> sets out an economic theory of giving software away. The economic theory of giving it away might be examined by the Minister and his officials. It seems to be about to take off and Mr. Gates might be about to face a new challenge. This may be heresy in the Department but this is a Second Stage speech so I counsel that it is looked at.</P>
    <P>Some things have changed since the Department was last here. The US federal courts have decided that Mr. Gates has behaved badly. He is a monopolist who has a dominant position and he has abused that position. His actions have held back progress and obstructed development in the software industry. They have not benefited consumers while earning thousands of billions of dollars for Microsoft and making Mr. Gates the richest man in the history of the world. That is not me speaking, that is the outcome of the court decision in the United States. It is expected that sometime next year, the US courts will exact justice on foot of that preliminary decision.</P>
    <P>Copyright law has facilitated this abuse of power by Microsoft &ndash; it classes Microsoft's computer programmes as literary works. As my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, said during the Seanad debate on this Bill, a computer programme may be a literary work for the purposes of copyright law but not in common sense. Using a phrase from a real literary work by a genuine author, the law is an ass in this regard. Mr. Gates is now regarded as being on the same level as William Shakespeare.</P>
    <P>It may, however, be that the alternative tradition in computer programming, open source programming, may be about to challenge Microsoft. There would be a certain irony in that. It is interesting, as Senator Ryan pointed out, that life saving drugs do not have the same protection as Mr. Gates's Windows. They come under an inferior regime of intellectual property patent law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> I now turn to some specifics. A definition of the &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; is curiously missing. Just about everything that needed to be defined for the purposes of the Bill has been except the Internet. Why is this the case? The absence of a definition probably leaves it for the courts to decide. Does the Minister of State consider that appropriate? The decision to use the term &ldquo;copying&rdquo; to describe the restricted act which forms the basis of the reproduction right has attracted puzzled remarks from a number of commentators, including the Irish Copyright Licensing Agency. Reproduction is the agreed norm at international level. The Bill follows international norms carefully in certain other respects and I am not sure why it departs from it here. It is felt that copying may lead to confusion and it seems to be a narrower interpretation of the restricted act than would be the case if reproduction were used.</P>
    <P>This relates especially to sections 37 and 38. Section 38 illustrates how confusing, difficult, complex and detailed this is. It provides that:</P>
    <P>38 &ndash; (1) References in this Part to copying shall be construed as including references to all or any of the following, namely &ndash;</P>
    <P>(a) in relation to any work &ndash;</P>
    <P>(i) storing the work in any medium;</P>
    <P>(ii) the making of copies which are transient or incidental to some other use of the work;</P>
    <P>(b) in relation to an artistic work, the making of a copy in three dimensions of a two dimensional work and the making of a copy in two dimensions of a three dimensional work;</P>
    <P>(c) in relation to a film, television broadcast or cable programme, making a photograph of the whole or a substantial part of any image forming any part of the film, broadcast or programme;</P>
    <P>(d) in relation to a typographical arrangement of a published edition making a reprographic copy of the arrangement.</P>
    <P>Will opting for copying as distinct from reproduction invite litigation in this area?</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;research&rdquo; greatly preoccupied a number of Senators. They held the view that the definition in the Bill, as initiated, would have been an imposition on genuine research in the research and university community. However, the Bill has been amended in this respect and the matter must still be examined by the House on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister of State decided on the strengthening of governmental copyright? This is a regressive step. When in office, I publicly signalled my intention to relax such copyright in favour of wider public interest exemption. I thought I had persuaded my civil servant colleagues of that approach. Will the Minister of State outline <Col N="1087" /> the reason for the reversal in policy? It is difficult to understand the rationale for changing that.</P>
    <P>That copyright law should be used to restrict research in an abuse of the concept of copyright. Its origins can be traced, as Deputy Stanton said, back to the British Statute of Anne, 1709. The full title of the statute is &ldquo;An Act for the encouragement of learning by vesting the copies of printed books in the authors or purchasers of such copies during the times herein mentioned&rdquo;. The title communicates perfectly the intention of the statute.</P>
    <P>The definition of an &ldquo;artistic work&rdquo; appears to be somewhat primitive from the point of view of modern art and the techniques of some more <i>avant garde</i> artists. This was also raised in the Seanad and it will be a matter for scrutiny in this House.</P>
    <P>The Bill effectively gives permission to teachers and students to copy in an educational context. However, it appears that reprographic reproduction is excluded. This is nonsense unless there is an ulterior motive to create a licensing regime for photocopying. This is a totalitarian concept ultimately whereby for photocopying to take place it must happen legally and for it to be legal it must be licensed. Of course, for it to be licensed there must be a new collecting society, in effect, a private licensed tax collector. Collecting societies have not covered themselves in glory and have proved to have a distinct tendency to tyranny and abuse.</P>
    <P>The irony of the licensing and collecting approach is that it runs against the entire historic rationale and origins of copyright in the Statute of Anne, 1709. The purpose of this enactment was in part to encourage learning, but also to dismantle in the name of freedom of speech and thought the system of state licensing or censorship that then existed. It is ironic that copyright, the original purpose of which was to extend freedom, is used to limit freedom not in the name of State censorship but in the cause of monopoly profit. Big business and the State are combining to limit freedom in the name of mammon.</P>
    <P>The totalitarian impulse in the name of money is again evident in section 54 in the provision that a parent is not a connected person to a child in a school for the purposes of the section, thus allowing collection societies loose on the school concert. There is also a continuation of a remarkable approach to the law in the Bill which is the presumption of guilt on the part of anyone who is alleged to be in breach of copyright law. Accompanying this, a draconian power of seizure is given to rights owners with no provision made for penalising a rights owner where he or she acts abusively in respect of claiming rights and seizure.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that the Bill has been amended to make copyright in legislation reside with the Oireachtas. This fully reflects the primacy of Parliament in this parliamentary democracy. However, the Bill might have given statutory effect to the rainbow Government decision, in <Col N="1088" /> which I had a part, to waive copyright on enactments in the interest of freedom of information in respect of an important aspect of citizenship. Will the Minister of State explain the rationale for 125 years for Government copyright?</P>
    <P>Broadly, the Bill proposes to introduce into law, in the common law tradition, continental European copyright philosophy and moral right is one example of that. However, this is a radical departure, particularly from the standpoint for culture and the public sphere. In essence, the continental tradition is one of privatising and taking proprietorship of cultural products and creations. This approach is highly developed and well established and the public life of culture functions very well in this model, as anyone familiar with the richness of cultural life on the continent is aware. One part of the explanation is public policy. The state plays an enormous role in cultural life on the Continent. The other part of the explanation lies in the highly elaborate and developed system of arbitration and formal disputes resolution procedures available in continental countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that in Ireland the Patents Office will take on this character as well as doing its old job. This could prove to be a disaster. The office has never acted in this fashion or in such a role. It does not have that culture or the staff or resources to do the job. It has another job to get on with in respect of that job. Certainly, in respect of that job, a number of years ago it was left to languish in a worse state than the Companies Registration Office. I do not know whether the Attorney General has approved this section or whether it was published before he came to office. The Minister should ask the Attorney General whether he thinks the Patents Office will be able to take on the role given to it here. The Attorney General, when a Member of the House, brought the state of the Patents Office to our attention.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is enacted and if it gives a <i>carte blanche</i> to collecting societies, strengthens their hands further, puts no limits on them, establishes no watchdog regime for them and leaves the Patents Office bereft of resources, expertise and money, there will be a severe restriction on freedom, entirely in the name of money.</P>
    <P>Copyright and the law of intellectual property, more generally, is about much more than the Act of 1709. It is a much more decent thing. It is about creating a civilised literate and learned society in which intellectual endeavour is cultivated and the grant-aided tax relief creative community works for the wider social good and the stimulation and enrichment of cultural life. Ideally the State should regulate or intervene only to the extent to which it can be said to further the public interest. Copyright itself is a case in point. It is an artificial construct created by the State with a public interest in mind. In the case of copyright, at any time the public interest may or may not coincide with the interests of any one or any combination of the groups interested in copyright. Providing for the public interest requires balancing the <Col N="1089" /> interests of the various groups against each other and against the general social interest.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising there are a number of diverse vested interests who, quite legitimately, want to advocate their case in respect of the detail of this Bill from the Arts Council to the Centre for Independent Living to a variety of industry bodies and so on. For that reason I support the proposal by Deputy Stanton that the relevant select committee be given the opportunity to hear from these vested interests their point of view on the Bill. I am afraid the business of drafting this legislation, notwithstanding its importance and significance, is very much an exclusive pastime. The level of awareness, both in the House and outside, even of those who ought to be concerned with it, is minimalist. As Deputy Stanton said, some of those who ought to be concerned about it are only now becoming aware of it. I am not sure the debate here will provoke widespread interest in it. It ought to be more significant to journalists than a normal Bill coming before the House because there are aspects of it with which they should be concerned. I do not think there is that level of awareness or familiarity with this important Bill. Like Deputy Stanton, I look forward to the Minister providing adequate time, not to delay the passage of the Bill but to hear from the various interest groups and to process Committee Stage having heard that input.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is a substantial Bill that covers every possible angle on the issue of copyright and matters related thereto.</P>
      <P>I have had much input from members of the public on various aspects of the Bill. One constituent queried its constitutionality. He said that while copyright is a property right, it raises interesting questions as to its constitutional protection. The Constitution refers to the right of &ldquo;private ownership of external property&rdquo;. It is not clear to my constituent if that could be held to include intangible property such as copyright or intellectual property rights. I would appreciate the Minister's clarification on that issue.</P>
      <P>Section 23 states the usual practice in relation to the first copyright ownership of intellectual property in countries other than the United States. The intent here is that if a person is paid a wage to produce intellectual property, the employer is deemed to own what has been paid for. It is worth saying this leaves the employer with all the rights and the employee with none and flies in the face of all the current trends and talk of profit sharing. For example, the reality is that most companies will provide people who invent things with a share in the rewards of their success after the costs of exploiting it have first been paid. It may be that the time has come for all intellectual profit sharing to be enshrined in law. This will endow the rights on creative people and it will reward creativity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 24, 25 and 30 extend the duration of copyright in literary, artistic, dramatic, musical, films and computer-generated works from 50 <Col N="1090" /> years to 70 years after the author's death. This provision, had it been in force in the late 1980s, would have meant that the works of W. B. Yeats and James Joyce, to mention just two Irish authors, would still be copyright rather than freely available as now. We should debate those provisions seriously and decide how long copyright should exist rather than take the directives of the European Commission and Council.</P>
    <P>Section 31 has important implications for researchers in Ireland. It means the copyright in each volume, part, instalment, issue or episode of a work, such as a periodical publication, subsists separately. Will the Minister clarify whether he regards each paper or article in a journal, which can be cited separately in another such article, paper or publication, or whose abstract can be catalogued with a separate reference number, as a &ldquo;part&rdquo; for the purpose of copyright? This would be important in determining the number of such articles or papers that can be copied from a research journal.</P>
    <P>Researchers would prefer the freedom to copy selected articles at will from research journals for research or for private study. If the copyright in each of these research papers or articles were to be regarded as subsisting separately, it could allow the copying of more than one of them from the same issue of a research journal, something that is essential for researches. I put it to the Minister that there is a strong legal basis to do so, in so far as each research paper is written as a separate work and, therefore, has original copyright attached to it.</P>
    <P>A separate copyright assignment form is always executed for each research paper submitted for publication in a research journal. Certainly the legal position regarding the copying of research papers which is proposed in the Bill is unsatisfactory for researchers. It is unworkable and unenforceable. It is a bad law which every researcher in the country knows will be flouted openly. Bad laws should not be enacted. I appeal to the Minister to reopen the question of the copying of research papers from journals because of the unique format of these publications and the manner in which they are handled by libraries.</P>
    <P>Section 39 makes it clear that what it calls &ldquo;the performance&rdquo; of a work, which term it defines to include speeches, lectures and sermons among other acts, is a publication. This is nothing new in legal terms but it further strengthens the case of researchers to say that each individual research paper in a journal is a separate work of publication. If they first give the paper orally or by exhibiting a poster at a conference, the work is clearly regarded in law as separate. The associated research paper which appears in a journal as the written proceedings of a conference must certainly be considered as a separate work. The implication is that it should be legally possible for a researcher to copy as many research papers as he and she wants for research or private study. There is a case to be made for this line of logic and I hope the Minister will consider it. This <Col N="1091" /> would be the case if the articles are copied from a book or journal issue which is or purports to be the written proceedings of a conference at which the paper, to use the legal term which I understand researchers do not like, was first performed to the public.</P>
    <P>Sections 43 to 47, inclusive, provide wide-ranging powers to punish the secondary infringement of copyright. An example would be the case of a person who allows bootleg recordings to be played at a disco on his or her premises and does not have reason to believe that there would not be a copyright infringement. The powers are severe in that they place the onus on the offender to know that there would not be a copyright infringement at the time of providing the premises.</P>
    <P>Sections 48 to 51, inclusive, are important for the public as they provide important exemptions to use copyrighted works without paying a licence fee. Section 60 specifically deals with the copying of articles from periodicals such as research journals.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer in particular to sections 49 and 60. I compliment the Minister of State on his acceptance of a key amendment tabled by Senator Henry in the Seanad to certain related sections which addressed one of the concerns of researchers about the Bill in relation to the copying of research papers. The wording &ldquo;research and private study&rdquo; means that the provision of these important fair dealing exemptions apply to research in general, not just private research. As initiated the Bill would have impeded normal research practices in universities and research centres.</P>
    <P>Researchers and research students need to be able to copy free of licence charges and read selected research papers relating to their specialist field of study. These are published in a well established and professionally regulated manner to ensure the highest standards. The system works well. Researchers and their students write articles, generally called research papers, which are submitted to specialist research journals either directly or sometimes after the presentation of the work at a conference of researchers. The research paper is reviewed by other researchers in the field and often revised before acceptance. It is then published as an article in several pages of a research journal which may have ten or even more than 100 such articles in a single issue.</P>
    <P>The publication process is expensive as the circulation of these journals is relatively small compared to mainstream media but it must be realised that the reviewing is done free of charge by the reviewers. It may surprise some Deputies from other fields of work to learn that the authors do not get paid for the articles. In many cases it is the other way around and they must pay a page fee to be published. This practice is especially prevalent in the case of American journals. Some publishers do not charge authors to publish their <Col N="1092" /> research. I single out the Dutch company, Elsevier, for special mention. It has made an important contribution to Ireland in terms of employment in Shannon and especially in its gift of a free subscription for 1999-2000 to all its journals for on-line access by researchers in universities within the State.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the controversial section 60. Researchers are concerned that they will be able to continue to be able to make copies of more than one research paper from the same issue of a journal. As section 60(2) stands they will not be permitted to do so. I have been made aware of the detailed concerns of the Irish Research Scientists Association on this matter. I appeal to the Minister of State to bring forward the necessary amendments to enable the copying of more than one research paper from the same journal issue.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to him to bring forward a second simple technical amendment to section 60 to which no interest group could reasonably object. Most libraries when they have accumulated one year's or several years' issues of a journal bind the issues together like a hard book to ensure their survival over years of use. As the Bill stands the act of binding several issues means that only one research paper from the entire bound volume can be copied. This anomaly should be removed by a technical amendment as it is unworkable and unfair.</P>
    <P>What many researchers would like to see is a situation where each research paper is for copyright purposes treated as a separate published work with the right to make a copy for research or private study. Researchers hope others will read their work. That is the reason they publish it. They do not make any money from publishing their work. It costs them time and money but it is essential for them as researchers to build a reputation. Researchers need a free flow of information with the minimum of obstacles. If we wish to encourage research we need to be conscious of the needs of researchers.</P>
    <P>This matter is of major concern to me as a Deputy for Cork North Central, a constituency which may well have the highest concentration of researchers in Ireland. University College Cork, which is located within it, has the highest research income of any university in the State. Within the university there are long established specialist research centres of excellence &ndash; the National Microelectronics Research Centre and the National Food Biotechnology Centre. The Cork Institute of Technology has an unparalleled research reputation while ten miles from the boundary of my constituency is located the Agricultural Research Centre at Moorepark, Fermoy.</P>
    <P>These are the workplaces of hundreds of researchers whose intellectual lifeblood is access to research papers and many of whom are worried about their future ability to copy research papers without bureaucratic obstacles and free of charge. I draw the attention of the Minister of State to section 87 which contains a good definition of articles in periodicals in the scientific or <Col N="1093" /> technical field that may lawfully be made available to the public without infringement of copyright. The section should be widened to include research papers on subjects which are not scientific or technical. Economics and history research comes to mind.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the plain people of Ireland I heartily welcome section 96 which permits us to legally video a television programme for the purposes of watching it later. This is the type of people-friendly approach that we need in our laws and contrasts with the mean-minded attitude in some other copyright areas where owner-interest rules all. Greed rather than need governs the use of the work.</P>
    <P>It appears that section 98 only allows a cable programme service, which is legally defined to include MMDS and other potential means, to rebroadcast television channels. It is essential to read the section in conjunction with section 2 regarding the definition of a &ldquo;cable programme service&rdquo; which is defined to mean much more than cable television and includes MMDS which is a non-cable television service. It is not clear whether this definition includes the deflector systems of rebroadcasting. I am pleased that this week the Director of Telecommunications Regulation is about to issue certain licences in this domain. I do not want the deflector operators to be tripped up by a technical provision in copyright law that sends us down the road of more legal and social conflict over this people-driven enterprise in response to lack of signal from our national network which has created a genuine demand for a complementary service. Will section 98 permit the owners of a deflector system such as South Coast Television in Cork to rebroadcast a television programme in the usual way that their systems operate? </P>
    <P>Much of this Bill is relevant to the Broadcasting Bill and Deputies would do well to examine both. Similar issues arise. For example, as I mentioned in my speech last week on the Broadcasting Bill, section 99 protects the right to make subtitled television programmes. Many sections, especially section 127, give the Garda Síochána powers to tackle the counterfeiters who are the real enemies of the music industry. I wholeheartedly support these efforts. It is these criminals, not the barbers who have the radio turned on in their barber shops, who should be the focus of attention for the enforcers of copyright legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 187 is very important in that it provides a right for each university to obtain free books under the copyright laws. It is a form of funding by authors for universities. This is a tradition that originated under former regimes. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge, Trinity College and the British Library, London were copyright libraries of record. It is a clever way to stock university libraries with obscure books. Section 187 is long overdue in the interests of equity. It grants this right to all universities within the State as well as the National Library. I am concerned, <Col N="1094" /> however, about the wording of the provisions that relate to University College Cork. Section 187 states that certain named bodies are to get copies of books within one month of publication. It also stipulates that the NUI will get four copies of the book for use in the four constituent colleges in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Maynooth. Under the existing wording, there is nothing to prevent one of the bodies named being allocated two copies. I would be happier if there was explicit wording to the effect that each of the universities named is entitled to a copy of the book. This will ensure that UCC will be guaranteed one copy, as will all the universities named. That is important in view of the universities becoming essentially independent under the recent Universities Act. We are granting this right to the British Library on a reciprocal basis. We are also granting the right to the two English copyright libraries. The word &ldquo;England&rdquo; should be inserted after &ldquo;Oxford&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cambridge&rdquo; in this section, and to the national libraries of Scotland and Wales, as they grant us reciprocal rights. The two universities in Northern Ireland should be included in this section in the spirit of the practical unification of Ireland. Why not extend this right to Queen's University Belfast and the University of Ulster?</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with performers' rights. I am a strong advocate of the general rights of Irish and non-Irish performers. The labourer is indeed worthy of his hire. It is easy to point to the success of bands and singers like The Chieftains, Christy Moore, U2 and Enya, but for every success, 100 small bands could be depending on cash flow. They need the income from their copyright royalties and fees. The organisation which enforces these rights, however, the Irish Musicians' Rights Organisation, IMRO, must also take into account the rights of others. I am sure that organisation realises that hundreds of thousands of ordinary people are trying to make their small shops and family businesses work. They must collect their debts and run their businesses themselves. They have no large organisation to back them up.</P>
    <P>I refer particularly to the practice of IMRO of seeking a licence from small businesses and shopkeepers who play the radio in their shops and workplaces. I am amazed at its approach to the use of radios in hotel bedrooms and I cannot believe the organisation is serious in this matter. This and many other matters raises the hackles of ordinary people who are trying to make a living in this country. I will explain the most common complaint I receive in this context.</P>
    <P>Most of us are under the impression that radio stations pay a hefty royalty to performers for the right to play their records on a national broadcast to the four corners of Ireland. Why should people playing the radio pay a second royalty for the same performance for a public that would be perfectly entitled under law to bring along their own radios with earphones and listen to the same broadcast while shopping or working? This is <Col N="1095" /> intensely annoying to people and is seen as a form of double taxation.</P>
    <P>The concept of listening inspectors in plain clothes, wandering around under cover in shops and factories listening for radios playing reminds me of the stories about the glimmer man checking the gas cookers during the emergency. Will they be asking for a licence fee from people playing radios on the beach? We have had enough. Playing a radio in a public place should be exempted from copyright law, provided the radio is not used to entertain people paying for admission to a premises. I would like the Minister to introduce the necessary amendments to sections 191 to 203, inclusive, of the Bill to allow the playing of radios in shops and workplaces without licences.</P>
    <P>I wonder if some of the language contained in section 2, under the definition of what does not constitute &ldquo;a cable programme service&rdquo;&ndash; I refer to pages 26 and 27 of the Bill &ndash; could be similarly used to exclude the proprietors of shops, garages etc. from the obligation to pay for a licence. They could lawfully say that the radio, tape recorder or CD player playing in their premises is in the sole control of the owner.</P>
    <P>I want to make one final general comment before concluding. Are the Ministers aware that large media organisations are buying up vast quantities of photographic images and films to which copyright attaches? They are doing this for the purpose of controlling and profiteering from their exploitation in new forms of pay per view and multimedia communications. Images such as famous paintings are included. In years to come this will restrict what is available as common property to all mankind. It is a fundamental abuse of copyright. I am also concerned that in the future, Sky Sports may seek to buy the rights to the All-Ireland finals. Why are we tolerating this type of practice? We should discuss with our European partners ways to stop other restrictive practices such as this abuse of copyright law.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. It is important and complex and I hope the Government will examine it line by line. We must safeguard the rights of the creators but in doing so we must not ignore the strong reservations expressed by representatives of consumers, the users of the created art. It is the demand for published works and the audiences who support the performing artists that generate the finance which makes their chosen careers viable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister in advance for bringing the Bill into the select committee next week. That is important as it will allow people to debate it further. As Deputy Stanton correctly stated, this is complex legislation which is new to many Deputies on this side of the House who do not have the back-up and resources to deal with its many aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Broadcasting Bill was also before the House this week. That is detailed, complex legislation which will allow 35 channels to be broad<Col N="1096" /> cast in Ireland through the digitalisation and globalisation of TV. That will be very much part of the copyright question in years to come, in addition to pay per view and the control of the Internet, in that so much material can be readily accessible.</P>
    <P>It is useful to put the Bill in its proper context. Its contents are primarily dictated by the need for Ireland to implement European directives and certain international agreements. The contents of the Bill mirror the provisions of the following: the software directive of 1991; the rental and lending right directive of 1992; the directive on satellite broadcasting retransmission of 1993; the term directive of 1993; the database directive of 1996; the Paris Act of Berne; the GATT-TRIPs; and the WIPO treaties. The Bill is a consolidation of all that European legislation which we now hope to implement.</P>
    <P>While noting the obligation to enact the provisions of the European directives and international agreements, it is also relevant to note that the draftsman has, in some substantial respects, &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; provisions from the UK Copyright Designs and Patents Act, 1988. From the point of view of enacting legislation, we are not in breach of copyright but many of the provisions in the Bill would be on the Statute Book in the UK.</P>
    <P>I want to examine the basic elements which make up copyright law, and the ways in which the law will change by virtue of the Bill when it becomes law. By &ldquo;basic&rdquo; I mean the meaning of copyright, the works which enjoy copyright, ownership of copyright, the duration of copyright, the rights of the copyright owner, the exceptions to copyright and the penalties for infringement and remedies of the copyright owner.</P>
    <P>What is the meaning of copyright? Copyright is defined afresh in section 17. It is the right of the copyright owner to do or authorise others to do certain things in relation to his or her work. There is nothing new in this but what is new is that the copyright is also stated to be a property right. This may have ramifications which have yet to be explored. It carries the curious possibility that some of the incidents of property ownership, which did not previously apply to copyright, might now become relevant.</P>
    <P>It is also stated for the first time that copyright protection will not extend to the ideas and principles which underlie any element of a work. It has always been a basic tenet of copyright that it only encompasses the expression of an idea and not the idea itself. The wonder is not that this is stated in the Bill but that it was not previously specified in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 17 goes on to remove from the meaning of &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; a work which infringes the copyright in another work or which is a copy of a work previously made available to the public, so that an infringing work cannot enjoy its own copyright. This was, effectively, the position previously, but it is stated here clearly for the first time. By comparison with the 1963 Act, the <Col N="1097" /> meaning of copyright is stated in a simpler but more comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>Section 17 also contains a list of works which will enjoy copyright. These include original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; sound recordings and films; and original databases, which is very important, given, as Deputy Rabbitte said, the difficulties of controlling and policing the Internet. The commercialisation of copyright is big business and there will be litigation over vast sums of money.</P>
    <P>The list in section 17 does not add anything new to the kinds of works which were protected by the 1963 Act. However, although there is no new category of subject matter in section 17, by virtue of expanded definitions, the terms used to describe the types of protected work encompass a much broader range of potential material than underthe 1963 Act; for example, the new definitions of &ldquo;sounding recording&rdquo;, &ldquo;film&rdquo; and &ldquo;database&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under the 1963 Act, protected works were classified into works which were covered under Part II of the Act and works covered under Part III. Part II dealt with the works of the creator &ndash; the literary author, the composer of music, the visual artist. Part III dealt with the rights of the exploiter &ndash; the maker of the sound recording, the film maker, the broadcaster and the publisher. The Bill, by drawing all protected works together in section 17, effectively abolishes the old distinction between Part II and Part III works. This has wide-reaching implications, which will be discussed next week in the House.</P>
    <P>The provisions concerning the ownership of copyright are contained in sections 21 to 23. It is the &ldquo;author&rdquo; of a work who shall be the first owner of the copyright in all section 17 works. &ldquo;Author&rdquo; is defined widely as &ldquo;the person who created the work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the 1963 Act relating to the duration of copyright had already been changed before the publication of the Bill, when the EU duration directive became law in 1995 by statutory instrument. The statutory instrument is revoked and its provisions are restated in the Bill. This means that for literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, the copyright term is extended from 50 to 70 years. In the case of a film, the term is 70 years after the death of the last of certain of the persons involved in the making of the film. A 50 year term also applies to sound recordings, broadcasts and cable programmes.</P>
    <P>In relation to literary works, some interesting questions arise about works which went out of copyright under the 1963 Act, when the old term of &ldquo;life of the author and 50 years&rdquo; expired, and then came back into copyright when the statutory instrument was enacted in 1995. One has to look hard to find anything in the Bill about this. Eventually, one comes across section 9 of the First Schedule, Part I, at the back of the Bill, which deals with transitional provisions. This states that the duration of copyright in works which qualify for copyright protection when the <Col N="1098" /> Bill is made law will continue to be determined by reference to the statutory instrument, although the instrument has been revoked. This means the EU directive, as transposed in the statutory instrument, will continue to govern the awkward situation of works coming back into copyright.</P>
    <P>As previously, anyone making available to the public for the first time a work which is already out of copyright will enjoy a 25 year term of protection. Therefore, publishers and other people can buy works that are out of copyright cheaply and then exploit them commercially. Such people will cherry-pick the better pieces. There is a great deal of money to be made in this area. The original publisher of the work 50 years ago is now likely to be dead and these works can be bought cheaply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte stated that the period for Oireachtas copyright is being increased to 125 years. Given that Dáil debates are now available on the Internet, one wonders why that copyright period has been increased to 125 years, when the normal period is 50 to 70 years.</P>
    <P>As a restaurant owner and publican, the concerns of retailers are close to my heart. This Bill has far reaching implications for the service industry, particularly the hotel, licensed premises and restaurant trades. When the Copyright Act, 1963, was passed, it represented a compromise between economically powerful interests, such as multinational record companies, traditional copyright holders and certain State policies. As a result, the 1963 Act provided for two types of copyright &ndash; the absolute copyright of the composer of musical work and the qualified, or secondary, copyright of the record companies.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this is that the composer who has the absolute copyright is entitled to refuse to allow the material to be used without a licence and the payment of a royalty. On the other hand, the owner of the secondary copyright is not entitled to refuse, but is entitled to the payment of a charge called equitable remuneration if the material for public performance.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill abolishes the distinction between the rights of record companies and composers. Under this proposed section, the record companies are given the same level of veto over the playing of sound recordings as composers enjoy in respect of musical works. This is manifestly unjust and unnecessary and is hugely detrimental to the interests of music users. This huge anomaly should be debated next week in the House.</P>
    <P>History has shown that, unless prevented by law from so doing, large multinational record companies will abuse their positions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the music users. This is controlled by a very small number of players in the field who have huge power. It was brought to my attention in the late 1980s that PPI, a group which purports to represent record companies and which owns 80 per cent of the copyright in sound recordings played in this country, increased its tariffs by 1600 per cent. Who gives PPI and IMRO their licences? <Col N="1099" /> They must be answerable to somebody. They cannot dictate charges and monopolise the market. We are in the driving seat here. If this organisation was inefficient for so long, why should it get such an increase at a time of single figure rates of inflation?</P>
    <P>While this massive Bill is mind-boggling, we must examine the simple aspects of the enforcement of copyright legislation in the State. This will have a huge impact on the commercial interests of those who are trying to survive in business, employing staff and complying with regulations and controls. The service industry receives very little support from the State. There are 160,000 small business in this country, 90 per cent of which employ less than 13 people. This is a significant sector of the economy and we must ensure that there is a balance and proper regulation governing those who call to such companies to collect tariffs.</P>
    <P>IMRO represents the interests of composers who have absolute copyright, and increased its charges by 28 per cent. This was a reasonable increase. However, does the Minister intend to establish a single regulatory authority to control the charge levied? I am particularly interested in small businesses. This system could operate similar to the television licence whereby RTE, as the national broadcaster, is the sole beneficiary of the licence fee. Will any of the fees paid come back into the State? Is there any accountability regarding the amount of money to be collected by way of royalties? Where will this money go to and what are these people doing for it? Composers and publishers are entitled to their share. We are talking about a very significant amount of money and a portion of it should be used to encourage new people entering the market. This situation requires legislation and will be exploited if the Minister is not careful.</P>
    <P>What is to stop a different group claiming to represent a different interest? Could such people obtain a licence which allowed them to demand £50 under threat of seeking an injunction? When the charges were challenged by hotel and nightclub owners and RTE, PPI obtained injunctions preventing any recorded music being played unless and until the high tariffs it was seeking were paid up-front. Some people in Sligo felt that it was similar to the Revenue Commissioners coming in &ndash; their names were in the newspapers and they felt they were not complying with the law. The wrong message went out about people and it was blackmail. People had no choice but to pay up or go to court. Regulation must be fair so that people know there is an assessment carried out by the Minister's office and that the tariff is £500 per week which is to be paid at the beginning of the year following which they are entitled to operate. We do not want an unregulated situation where people go around using heavy-handed tactics. I am not talking about copyright as one would need a senior counsel to go through that area. I am concerned about the interests of the <Col N="1100" /> business community. Deputy Rabbitte correctly stated that there was a cultural aspect to this legislation. However, this Bill is about commercial interests &ndash; big money for a large number of people. We want everyone to get their fair share but we do not want the legislation to make millionaires out of certain people.</P>
    <P>The net result was that hotel owners were left with no option but to pay the amounts demanded or close. This was a serious abuse of power. The situation continued for several years until a Supreme Court decision confirmed that the organisation and owners of secondary copyright were not entitled to behave in this fashion or to demand large payments in advance of music being played, but were only entitled to equitable payments for the use of secondary recordings on which they could prove copyright. If the amount of equitable payment cannot be agreed the 1963 Act allows for the dispute to be referred to the controller of industrial and commercial property. The controller has a new role to play under this legislation and will become very busy. The office has been in operation since 1963 but will he be given increased powers? Will his job specification change due to this major legislation? I am concerned about the interests of businesses, particularly small firms, and I will pursue those interests next week. Will there be clarification of the position regarding the controller's responsibilities? Many people are not aware of this office and its powers and commercial interests, particularly service industries, need clarification on this issue.</P>
    <P>Section 17 needs to be examined as it appears unjust. It will enable record companies to prevent sound recordings being played in public, except on their terms. This raises serious questions. Record companies receive profits from sales of sound recordings and it is now proposed to give them the right to charge significant levies in advance of the use of those recordings. The economy is very buoyant at present and sales of records and CDs are very high. What is required is not the abolition of the distinction between the copyright of the composer and the record company, but a streamlined, fast and efficient mechanism whereby the amount of equitable remuneration to be paid to the owners of secondary copyright can be determined. The resources to achieve this do not appear to be available to the controller as the dispute continues. The presumption in section 134 that the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1998, provides that in copyright proceedings it is presumed that the person who claims to be the owner of the copyright is the owner unless the contrary is proved, is a significant change. I appeal to the Minister and his officials to look at this issue.</P>

      <P>This Bill has focused the minds of backbench Deputies on the unavailability of research staff to help them understand the nature and direction of the legislation. This is comprehensive legislation which needs quite an <Col N="1101" /> amount of analysis and time. In preparing my contribution I became aware of the unavailability of people to assist in research. The Bill covers a complex legal minefield. It is a comprehensive Bill which updates previous legislation. I commend the Minister and all involved for bringing it before the House as it gives Members an opportunity to tease out the detail and make an input.</P>

Given the creative talents of the Irish people and our commitment to excellence in design, whether in traditional crafts, new developments in information technology, software and web site design and our ability to perform and produce artistic creations admired by audiences worldwide, it is imperative that the Bill be put in place to protect the copyright of all our work. One need only read today's newspapers to see the complications and legal cases which can arise from copyright issues. Copyright and the Irish people's creativity is fundamental to the on-going development of our modern, progressive economy as we know it.</P>
      <P>The protection offered in the Bill gives encouragement to those actively involved in traditional artistic categories of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works to continue, knowing that their intellectual investment is protected and that income derived on an ongoing basis through copyright is secured and covered by law. The comfort of the legislation means that those involved in creative activity can dedicate themselves to new and innovative creations for which this country has become famous.</P>
      <P>Given that our Irishness is impacting in a very positive way on the world stage, it is imperative that all EU directives and laws are reflected in modern Irish legislation. The fact that the EU was largely inactive in the area of intellectual property until the late 1980s means that its laws, particularly in relation to emerging technologies, are important for the protection of our IT sector, which is a world leader in terms of development, be it in software, website design etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we saw that Baltimore Technologies Limited designed signature software for the world market which is now widely used, including by the Taoiseach and Bill Clinton in signing agreements. This development is a good example of the type of investment which is demanded in this area in order to get a product from a thought or dream to reality. I have no doubt that many hours were spent developing this idea and that much finance was pumped into its support and development. Because of this the company has a right to the comfort of knowing that it will derive financial support from the product for a number of years. Likewise, there is a host of small <Col N="1102" /> businesses throughout the country developing software products. This work must be protected to ensure an income for the companies concerned in the future. Copyright will make these companies financially viable in the future. We are on the edge of what can be achieved in terms of information technologies, and the development by these companies of new modern software and perhaps hardware will lead to a new market development in Ireland. Because we are at the cutting edge of all these developments these products, given the right copyright protection, will lead us to an entirely new area of job creation. The young graduates now available in the marketplace are showing the way in this sector, not just at home but also abroad. I have no doubt that new companies being created abroad by these people will soon impact on the Irish economy. Therefore, it is vital that this legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>Legal access to copyright protection should be simplified in some form. There is a need to relax access to this type of copyright and for a greater understanding of people in the workforce creating new designs who need to be aware of what they can do with products they design. These people need to understand copyright issues and there is, therefore, a need for us as legislators to ensure access for them is made simple and that they can register their product or idea in an easy fashion and within a reasonable time. It is necessary for us to keep up to speed with developments given the pace of the marketplace and the technological developments which are taking place almost on an hourly basis and to ensure that people who devote their time and energy to this type of creativity are catered for in legislation.</P>
    <P>The operation of the worldwide web makes it even more difficult to protect copyright which has been registered or for the State or the EU to police certain aspects of copyright. We need some provision in legislation whereby we can continue to revisit the laws we put in place in order to update legislation in line with what is happening in the real world. We must examine the resources and staff made available to the Departments working in this area. We must ensure that the State's support mechanism is examined. Have we sufficient staff operating in this area? Do we require certain expertise from the staff we employ? Have we the technology required in the Department to continue to monitor the technological advances or the breaches which are taking place in terms of the worldwide web etc.? What policing exists in terms of current legislation? What policing will this new legislation require in future? What action will we take, if any, in the case of a breach of the law relative to a Department or a function of the Government? Is there somebody to police this area? I believe nobody is policing this area.</P>
    <P>Earlier a case was made regarding those who will benefit from this legislation. We must ensure that we are not creating a monster in terms of those who would take advantage of the legislation <Col N="1103" /> almost to punish others and use it in a less than legitimate way. We must be conscious of this and understand that we must police all activity in this area. I hope that when the Bill is being teased out on Committee Stage all these points will be raised and debated and that constructive and worthwhile amendments which make the Bill work more efficiently will be accepted and included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Public awareness is another issue relative to the Bill. How aware is the public of copyright issues? I believe the public understands the notion of copyright, but because of the world in which we live and the legal cases which are taken it is imperative the Government takes some action to ensure a public awareness campaign is launched so people understand what we are trying to achieve through this Bill and so their rights in relation to it. Often a wrong interpretation is placed on the issue of copyright. There is a misunderstanding even regarding current legislation. Because the legislation is comprehensive there is a need for us as legislators to explain in detail to the general public exactly what it is about.</P>
    <P>We can give a number of tangible examples on how this Bill and previous legislation impacts on the general public. Counterfeiters involved in copying tapes or CDs are selling their product on a daily basis. We can deal with these people in terms of copyright. Even in this instance we do not have sufficient resources available to the State to ensure all those involved in the black market are dealt with under the law. Therefore, the rights of artists and performers is in effect not protected to the full extent. The Bill underlines the need for further policing measures which can work. The full rigours of the law should be brought to bear on people who copy videos, CDs and tapes and their operations should be closed down as swiftly and effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>In terms of education the new developments in technology bring about the development of outreach centres in universities. In particular various courses are delivered from Queen's University in the case of Kilkenny, University College Cork, various Dublin universities and NUI, Maynooth. The material used in these courses is produced by lecturers and others in the education sector and we must ensure there is enough freedom under the legislation to avoid causing them concern.</P>
    <P>Sport has been mentioned by previous speakers. Given that this Bill is before the House at the same time as the Broadcasting Bill, it would be sensible to try to cross-reference what is happening in broadcasting with what is happening in the copyright process under this legislation. The deflector system is a case in point. How does the copyright legislation impact on that? Certain areas do not have an effective broadcasting service and they must use the deflector system. How will this legislation affect the broadcasting legislation in this regard?</P>
    <P>There is a move by companies to capture or hijack the enjoyment by the public of sporting <Col N="1104" /> events which have a worldwide interest. That is a type of copyright. They are taking the right to view these events from the general public unless the public is willing to pay to view them. That should not be the case. The companies have the right to purchase the events but there must be some provision for the good of the general public. This country should take a stand through its legislation, whether broadcasting or copyright, to ensure as much sport as possible is put on the public airwaves and not restricted to a minority who can afford to purchase viewing rights. We should examine the implications of what is happening for this country and the people who enjoy sport. We should develop legislation which will give us access to such events and protect the free broadcasting of Irish sport on the airwaves.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the submission Members received from the Irish Hotels Federation, the Irish Nightclub Industry Association and the Vintners Federation of Ireland. All legislation passed by the House should be policed. It should be effective legislation and should not have a negative impact such as that described in the submission from the three groups I mentioned. There is no point making law if it cannot be enforced. That is one of the complications with a number of aspects of this Bill.</P>
    <P>According as law is made, one can be sure some commercial body will endeavour to make an ass of it. That is the case with regard to IMRO and how it impacts on the public and businesses such as hotels, nightclubs and pubs. Most shops and supermarkets, apart from the premises of the three organisations I mentioned, will at some stage turn on the radio or play tapes for the enjoyment of the public. That is true even of Deputy O'Flynn's hairdressers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be conscious of what is happening outside. Current legislation has made it impossible for members of the three organisations to carry on their businesses. People enjoy shopping and socialising in hotels and pubs. In Kilkenny, which attracts huge numbers of tourists, there is a huge effort to make the city as comfortable and relaxing as possible. To achieve that, hotels and other such premises will generally play a tape or the radio. However, the current legislation makes it almost impossible for these organisations to continue that practice. It, therefore, has a negative impact on the public who use these venues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Hotels Federation says it has major worries about the enormous power being given under the Bill to PPI, Phonographic Performance Ireland, the collecting agency which collects fees <Col N="1105" /> on behalf of multinational record companies. Their other concerns include the presumption of ownership given to persons claiming copyright until the contrary is proved. The submission claims that is contrary to natural justice and could be unconstitutional. This area is a minefield of legal difficulties and we should not pass them on to businesses. They have enough to do keeping their doors open without worrying about whether to play the radio or a tape in the premises.</P>
    <P>The organisations also refer to the absence of a convenient mechanism by which disputes on the level of entitlement to copyright and royalty payments can be resolved. This issue should be simplified, not complicated with heavy legal argument. We should ensure the legislation is not so much simple as easily enforceable by either side of a dispute without recourse to complex legal argument.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of hotel bedrooms as places of public performance for the purpose of levying copyright duties on radios and televisions is unfair and onerous. Hotel bedrooms provide accommodation for travellers as an alternative to their normal place of abode and are, according to the submission, private places. I support that view. The interpretation of the legislation is being carried too far by organisations outside the Oireachtas who will try to enforce it.</P>
    <P>I support the case made by the three organisations. Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister of State will address their concerns. The organisations met the Minister of State recently so he understands their case. It is simply a matter of giving it reasonable accommodation in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not previously seen a Bill of this girth and complexity in my 17 or so years in the Oireachtas. I commend the intellectual property unit of the Department on its work. I can only begin to imagine how difficult it was to arrive at some degree of certainty about what should be included in the legislation. No doubt they and the Minister of State would be the first to admit that they might not have got everything right.</P>
      <P>Much of the legislation is predicated on and taken from the 1988 legislation passed in the UK. Our system appears to be based on the US and UK examples and experience. For that reason, the Bill merits great scrutiny. Another indication of the complexity of the legislation is that only recently have a number of the organisations, associations and individuals who will be affected by its provisions been alerted to the changes it will bring to their lives. One or two organisations were in the frame, as it were, when the Bill came before the Seanad. They lobbied Senators about their concerns when the Bill was introduced in the Seanad and some of their concerns were addressed by Ministerial amendments, but since then many more people with an interest in this subject have emerged and sent us submissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my suggestion and that of Deputy Stanton &ndash; whom I commend for the lead role he has <Col N="1106" /> taken in dealing with this Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party &ndash; I approached the Chairman of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. We discussed the complexity of this legislation and the difficult task faced by the Minister of State in ensuring the fulfilment of a commitment given by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the Bill would be passed by the end of this year to prevent a challenge for not implementing the terms of the TRIPs Agreement, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement.</P>
    <P>We saved ourselves from execution by introducing a minor amendment to copyright legislation in 1998, but a number of legal actions under Article 169 of the European Treaty are hanging over us like the sword of Damocles, if this legislation is not passed. I do not want the good name of Ireland dragged through the courts and I understand the imperative of the Minister of State. This, unfortunately, puts the Opposition into a pressure pot in terms of the manner in which we must deal with the legislation. I would prefer if Second and Committee Stages were not debated for at least another six months to give the Opposition, the Minister of State and his staff an opportunity to reflect on the concerns that are only now emerging. While many of these organisations have had a chance to talk to the Minister of State or his staff, most of them have only done so following the introduction of the Bill in the Seanad. The earlier method of circulating the Bill in draft form did not appear to work.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Chairman of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that the committee should meet the groups concerned, Department officials and, hopefully, the Minister of State to facilitate a round table discussion on the legislation before dealing with Committee Stage. I admit, without shame, that if we proceed to deal with Committee Stage without such a discussion, groups such as the Irish Hotels Federation, the business software alliance, librarians, IMRO, record producers and various other groups will ask me or other members of the Opposition to table amendments and when we do so Department officials will prepare speaking notes for the Minister of State which will state they cannot be accepted for certain reasons. Following that my intellectual capacity will probably wither because I will not be able to argue the case for their inclusion and the Minister of State might not be able to argue the case for their inappropriateness. It would be much more beneficial if the Department officials, who have expertise in this area, argued these points with the bodies concerned. I commend the chairman of the committee, Deputy Callely, on securing the agreement of the committee and the Minister of State to do this. That will short-circuit the Committee Stage proceedings and the Minister of State can then table amendments he considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>This is a door-stopper of a Bill. We received good deal of correspondence on this subject. In particular, a submission on the first recorded case <Col N="1107" /> of copyright infringement caught my eye. Many Members may not know that the first recorded case of copyright infringement occurred in the 6th century in County Donegal when St. Finian accused St. Columcille of copying the text from the Book of Durrow without his permission, at which time the High King, Diarmuid, having studied the case, made his famous decree, &ldquo;To every cow its calf, to every book its copy.&rdquo;  Despite us thinking we are being landed on the horns of a dilemma in trying to understand this legislation, in the 6th century some people were infringing copyright, although it was probably not called that then. They were copying books &ndash; artistic literary property &ndash; that belonged to other people.</P>
    <P>It was an artist who wrote to me about this first infringement. Deputy Stanton referred to <i>droit de suite,</i> which for artists is very important and has been almost ignored in this legislation. I have a personal interest in this aspect, as my husband paints and, although he does not sell his paintings, he is very protective of their copyright. He feels his paintings are like children and he does not want to lose out in respect of the many hours of painting he has put into them.</P>
    <P>A good artist may sell their paintings for £100 or £200 or, if he or she is lucky, get £20,000 for it. If that painting changes hands, it might sell for a good deal more. One of Caravaggio sold for £19,000 in Christies, but once it was discovered to be a Caravaggio it was worth £10 million. If Caravaggio were alive and got £19,000 for that painting, he would feel very sore if he if he did not get some benefit if was sold later for £10 million. He would have every right to feel sore about it because it was his artistic achievement and ability that made the painting so valuable. However, he is not around to tell us how he would feel about it.</P>
    <P>A provision covering <i> droit de suite &ndash;</i>the right to follow on &ndash; must be included in the legislation. It is the right of people to benefit if their work of artistic property is sold later for a much higher price. The Artists Association of Ireland has pleaded with the Minister of State to ensure a provision dealing with <i>droit de suite</i> is included in the legislation. I ask the Minister of State to table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We all understand property rights but not copyright. For example, my car is my property and if an offender stole it from outside my house and was pursued and caught, the law would take its course and the offender would be prosecuted. The concept of copyright and intellectual property, however, is difficult to understand. We do not readily associate rights with people who have completed artistic work. When we hear heavy metal music, pop music or a lovely song on the radio, we think it is our right to listen to it. As Deputy McGuinness said, music may help people relax in a hairdressing salon, even if it is one owned Deputy O'Flynn. We consider music to be <Col N="1108" /> public property, but we do not consider it to be somebody's property. That is why it is difficult to under the concept of copyright.</P>
    <P>When U2, Boyzone, Westlife, Sinead O'Connor or somebody else makes a record, people believe they get paid for the record. They get paid when they perform at concerts and for being well know artists, but they do not know that as artistic writers or perhaps artistic performers &ndash; which is a related right &ndash; they are entitled to some kind of benefit into the future for that work. Irish people in general object to paying for the music they hear on the radio. Vintners, hairdressers, dentists and others have objected to that. The Minister of State must address the lack of understanding about people paying into the future for a person's intellectual property, invention of new software, painting or book so that people will be willing to implement the law and obey it. That is a major hurdle and is a difficult subject to discuss on radio. The Minister must get over that hurdle before people will implement and obey the law.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult subject to talk about on radio. It is not good material for chat shows, such as &ldquo;The Marian Finucane Show&rdquo;. People's eyes glaze over when the Bill is mentioned. However, if they were told it would not be possible for a doctor to play pleasant music in the waiting room to help them to relax unless a licence fee is paid or that they could be prosecuted for buying illicit tapes or compact discs on the street, it would become important. It is a turgid subject at present. I hope the Minister enlivens the debate between now and the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It will be extremely difficult to implement and police many parts of this legislation. I am concerned about the role of the controller. I do not mean any disrespect to the controller, but that office has not worked. It is wrong of the Minister to automatically transfer the powers and enforcement procedures of this legislation to the existing format of the office of the controller.</P>
    <P>Many sections of this Bill mirror UK legislation, so why did the Minister not mirror the tribunal which exists under UK legislation and which allows experts from a variety of areas to make a judgment? People will believe a judgment is fair if it is made at a tribunal, but they may feel they will not get a fair hearing if they make their case to the controller as he may have a certain view. I am concerned the Minister will reply to any fundamental change by saying we should see if the legislation works and, if not, we can amend it in six months or a year. If the Minister changed it to a tribunal, it would change some of the other flaws highlighted. It would also prevent the Minister from having to go through the other submissions and it would create a good base for this legislation from the beginning. I have no doubt such important legislation will end up in court. That is why the Minister should rethink the concept of a tribunal versus the controller. I hope he takes our views seriously because this is an important matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> A number of groups lobbied us late and I told them this legislation did not just appear today or yesterday. There was a great deal of publicity when the draft copy of the legislation was published, but people did not realise its importance. However, that has changed and we should listen to them.</P>
    <P>The first groups which were on the ball when the legislation was introduced in the Seanad were the National Newspapers of Ireland and the NUJ. I know people are not interested in what happens here on a Thursday but I have no doubt some journalists are listening to what we say in their offices, although there are not any journalists in the Press Gallery. I thought one or two journalists, representing different forms of the media, would have been here given how important this legislation is for their industry.</P>

      <P>The National Newspapers of Ireland expressed concern to the Minister about section 23. During the debate in the Seanad the Minister introduced an amendment to ensure the copyright on the work of a journalist employed by a newspaper would be first owned by the newspaper. I accept the logic behind that. The same applies to a person who is employed to use his intellect and skill to make computers or parts of computers.</P>
      <P>The newspapers have accepted the change made by the Minister but they are unhappy with section 23(2). The National Union of Journalists has also expressed concerns about it and want it deleted. I hope the Minister will be able to act as Solomon in this case and find the right measure to allow staff journalists to have intellectual property rights to their work. One of the difficulties is that newspaper ownership is invested almost entirely in one person.</P>

Record companies have also made submissions. A number of amendments have been suggested to the Minister and I hope he takes them on board. Film Makers Ireland made a submission because it is concerned about some elements of the legislation. The Irish Copyright Licensing Agency also made a submission.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I seek clarification from the Minister about two representations made to me on the Bill. Deputy Owen mentioned the early history of this issue. One of the history lessons we learned in primary school was the monkish dispute and I remember the words of the judgment, &ldquo;le gach bó a gamhain agus le gach leabhar a mhacasamhail&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The National Union of Journalists, which represents the interests of journalists, has made known to me its concern about excessive power being given to newspaper proprietors to control its work. Having studied the relevant section of the Bill, I agree it gives inordinate power to newspaper proprietors. That is particularly the case in view of the concentration of ownership of newspapers in a few hands. Although people speak of a free press and freedom of expression, there is a relentless concentration of ownership in the hands of few major media outlets. Independent Newspapers, for example, not only controls a large slice of the national market but also the bulk of provincial papers. This shows how much power is concentrated in very few hands. Can the Minister justify his insistence, in the disputed subsections 23(1) and 23(2), on further concentrating power in those hands by giving considerable rights to newspaper proprietors over the work of journalists? I can foresee this legislation being abused, even in this country. Jonathan Pilger has done outstanding work in exposing serious injustices, the repression of poor people in forgotten countries, the armaments industry and the activities of multinational cartels and Governments in exploiting Third World people. Jonathan Pilger revealed to the world the horror being endured in East Timor. If articles by such a journalist were published in a powerful Irish newspaper and if they touched on the interests of the newspaper or were critical of interests which had a commercial relationship to the newspaper's proprietor, that proprietor could use the power the Minister proposes to give him to prevent further reproduction of those criticisms. In a context where people speak of freedom of expression, this gives undue power to powerful interests and I would like to hear the Minister respond to this.</P>
      <P>Representations were made by the Centre for Independent Living. I do not know if the Minister has met this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate. I agree with Deputy Owen that this Bill is a complex one which Opposition Deputies who do not have the resources of departmental officials might be tempted to allow to pass undisputed. Deputy Owen is right when she says it is not possible for the Government to get everything right and close scrutiny is warranted in this case. The Bill covers a wide range of areas affecting Irish society and the economy. Reference was made to the fact that we are not paying sufficient attention to the cultural dimension of the Bill. I reject that charge. I have a great interest in the cultural dimension of the Bill. I have followed developments in this area and I have taken particular interest in the elements in the Bill which deal with the rights of writers, artists, performers, film makers and those who work in the music industry. Much has been said of the MTV extravaganza which is taking place today in our capital city.</P>

      <P>The MTV awards ceremony is a tremendous global event and highlights the strength of our own music industry. I am speaking of the many individual song writers and performers which Ireland has produced over many years. I heard a discussion on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today about the dangers of the current bland element in the popular music industry compared to the previous search for novel and individual material. Ireland has been good at producing artists with their own interpretations and individual skills. I believe these are known as garage bands. We strive to seek out individual artists who have something different to offer. It is vital that this Bill protect these artists and performers and this is why it is so important.</P>
      <P>This debate has focused our attention on certain elements of the industry and one of these is the role of collecting agencies. I will refer shortly to the question of collecting agencies. At an earlier stage of these discussions I wrote to them and I hope they are listening like others whom we have asked to listen. They have much work to do in explaining their role in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for an information programme to get important messages across to the public. Deputies Stanton and Perry referred to this and I concur with them. This issue had emerged before I took up this Ministry of State and since coming to office I have endeavoured to publicise it in various media. Perhaps because the issue is too detailed, complex or expansive it is unfortunately not newsworthy. This is a great pity. I hope <Col N="1112" /> those involved in the media will take a greater interest in it. Groups such as the software alliance and the newspaper and music industries have taken a strong role in presenting their problems. Sectoral interests have managed to bring attention to their problems.</P>

      <P>It is very important that they know about the meeting next Wednesday so they can listen to the round table discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed. The work of the committee in advancing this information process is vital. There is a great deal of work for all of us but I would remind people from whatever sector, be it software, the music industry or cultural areas, with an interest in this area to endeavour to get the message across to the public in whatever way they can because we can only do so much here. I thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and who have endeavoured to do this.</P>
      <P>The other interesting aspect of this debate has been the contributions which Senators, in particular, made regarding traditional music. We have debated that here also. There is a strong interest in this area and Members of this House and the other House made important contributions on that aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In researching this legislation it was interesting to find that when the Copyright Bill, 1962, was being debated the late Jack Lynch was Minister and former Deputy Declan Costello was Opposition spokesman. It makes very interesting reading and it is worthy of mention. The language of the time was different but many of the issues raised were the same. The scrutiny it was given by our former colleagues is worth considering.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal with as many of the questions which were raised as possible and I hope Deputies will understand my approach. Due of the length of the Bill and the many sectors being dealt with, I am anxious to try to get it right. That has been my approach from the start. I acknowledge the work of Senators in the course of the debate in the other House. Their contributions helped to improve the Bill. It is a better Bill having gone through that process and I hope it will be improved further when it is passed through this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take the issues in the order in which they were raised, Deputy Stanton referred to the area of presumptions. The provisions on presumptions contained in section 134 are important in securing effective schemes of remedy and penalty since without them the ordinary law of evidence would place an impossible burden on many copyright holders in proving their case. For example, a music rights holder such as an Irish collecting society could be faced with blank denial on the part of a defendant that copyright subsisted even in patently modern songs with clear identified composers and authors, along with further denials of the existence of assignments and licences of the copyright instances concerned which brought <Col N="1113" /> the disputed rights into the rights holder's hands. The consequences of such a defence could be to require the collecting society to marshal not only affidavit evidence from home and aboard but a large number of witnesses, many of whom would be from overseas, to face cross-examinations on their affidavits. This is the position at present. The situation which obtains under the 1963 Act represents a wholly unreasonable restriction in the access of rights holders to justice. The Government is convinced it is necessary to remove this unfair burden for rights holders and section 134 represents a straightforward and effective way of redressing this manifest imbalance in copyright proceedings under the present law.</P>
    <P>Regarding concerns that the provisions of section 122 might undermine the evidentiary presumptions in favour of plaintiffs in section 134, I would prefer at this stage not to comment in detail on this point. However, discussions between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General have suggested that there may be a problem here and I am now considering the possibility of an amendment to rectify the situation. To repeat the point I made earlier, there are obviously issues which have emerged in the course of the consultation process and the debate in the Seanad which it will be well within our capacity to address on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The exclusive rights of owners of sound recordings were raised by Deputy Stanton. He asked whether the location of exclusive rights to owners of sound recordings under section 17 may create an imbalance between the rights of the sound recording industry and users of sound recordings. I received a number of submissions on this matter which I am carefully and urgently considering. In the event that I conclude that a change is necessary, I will bring forward an appropriate amendment on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>The <i>droit de suite</i> section was raised by Deputy Stanton. I have carefully considered this question of artists' resale rights in the context of current EU discussions on a possible directive on this subject. I came to essentially the same conclusion as the previous Government. Deputy Rabbitte will be well aware that the only artists likely to benefit are the small minority of prosperous artists with a strong secondary market in their works. More often than not, the artist has died and it is their estate which benefits. On the other hand jobs could be lost in the arts sales business as a result of a measure which would, in Irish conditions, do little more than cover its collecting costs. For these reasons, the Government continues to oppose the <i>droit de suite.</i> The Deputy rightly referred to a recent internal market meeting which I attended. However, the negotiations, as Deputy Stanton said, have not yet concluded and the question of whether <i>droit de suite</i> is pursued in Ireland will depend on the outcome of these negotiations. Again this is something which I would be glad to discuss with the Deputy on <Col N="1114" /> Committee Stage. There have been negotiations on the matter between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, as the Deputy is probably aware. It is a matter which is developing at EU level and I would be glad to update the Deputy as it progresses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a group here who are still concerned that they will lose their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that. The issue, like the Bill, is complex and there are arguments for and against, as my predecessor is aware.</P>
      <P>The question of the ownership of works produced by employee journalists in the course of their employment by newspapers was raised by Deputies Higgins, Stanton and others and reference was made to Mr. John Pilger, a writer whom I respect, in particular for what he has written about Cambodia and other human rights issues. I suspect Mr. Pilger would be covered on the basis that he is a freelance journalist. As the Deputy will be aware, this section does not deal with freelance journalists because they would have contracts with their employers whereas it does deal with employee journalists. I would suggest also that the right of subsequent use, which I have provided for in the section, would not muzzle somebody of Mr. Pilger's calibre.</P>
      <P>Under the 1963 Act, newspapers own copyright in such work only to the extent that it applied to its inclusion in a newspaper. The other share, so to speak, of the copyright is allocated to the employee journalist. In the course of the extensive consultation leading to the publication of the Bill, I gave careful consideration to strong representations of the National Newspapers of Ireland in this matter and concluded that there was no justification in maintaining this split copyright situation which applies in no other field of employment &ndash; Deputy Owen referred to that. However, in assigning the full copyright interest to the newspaper employer, I consider it just to retain some element of the right to exploit their work outside the newspaper context which, at the very least, can be regarded as a traditional entitlement of employee journalists. As the Deputy rightly stated, the newspaper industry is still not satisfied with this outcome but in most cases one will find that if one is trying to achieve a balance, one will not totally satisfy either side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Both sides want section 23(2) removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision proposed in the Bill should remove any reasonable doubt as to the right of newspaper proprietors to exploit works created by employees in the course of their employment. In particular, it conveys the full copyright interest to the employer-newspaper, allowing the employee-journalist to retain no more than a restricted right to use such work, which excludes their inclusion in the newspapers. In framing this provision I was aiming to strike a <Col N="1115" /> proper balance between the competing rights of the parties concerned, having regard to good principles of law as well as to the realities of the position traditionally obtaining. It remains my belief that I have found the balance. I do not understand the suggestion made by the NUJ that only natural persons can hold a copyright since it is quite clear that companies, such as publishing companies, can become full owners of economic copyright interests by purchase. It would be worth Deputy Owen's while checking the Seanad record because I think the Fine Gael spokesperson there argued the case for the newspaper industry. Again that needs to be checked carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate was only starting at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Although my colleagues in the House may advise me if they think they can improve it, in my view we have reached a balance between both interests, taking account of the fact that freelance journalists have particular rights, and many of the journalists which are not here are freelance journalists, although that is beside the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State could check the position because the NUJ has stated that copyright in all EU states, apart from the UK, cannot be held by a legal entity and must be held by a person. The only exception to this is where companies are formed specifically to collect and distribute royalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be more than happy to return to this subject on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputies McGuinness and O'Flynn referred to the free playing and broadcast of music in bedrooms in hotels and guesthouses. I am advised that where broadcasts of music are used in this way, the usual view taken at EU level and internationally is that this playing is done as an indirect means of obtaining commercial gain. However, there is a great deal of merit in Members' logical comments regarding the use of music in hotel and guesthouse bedrooms so I will reconsider the matter before Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to Government copyright. I am reviewing the term of protection applying to Government copyright and I may table amendments on Committee Stage. As regards the copyright relating to legislative materials such as Bills and Acts, I thought it better that, in the interests of clarity, this be assigned either to the Government or the Oireachtas. Under the amendment I accepted in the Seanad, it will be a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas to decide how this copyright should be exercised. The Government, like its predecessor, currently allows free copying without payment of royalties of the legislative materials to which I <Col N="1116" /> refer. In the civic interest, I am sure the Houses will wish to consider making similar arrangements when the rights in question are assigned to them. That is a matter for the Houses but I hope the current situation will continue to obtain.</P>
    <P>Members referred to the duration of copyright and the question of fair use. Reference was also made to the effect of the implementation of the EU duration directive on Irish law, particularly in respect of bringing back into copyright works which have previously entered the public domain as a result of the extension of the term of copyright from 50 years after the death of authors to 70 years. The preferred position of the Irish authorities on the duration directive did not favour the extension of the minimum term of copyright protection to 70 years. It is, however, a reality of the EU legislative process that negotiation and compromise are required on a broad front if anything is to be achieved. It is not possible for any member state to achieve all its objectives in the course of that process. The duration directive is now part of Irish law and must be reflected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte, Owen and others referred to the establishment of a copyright tribunal. We considered the possibility of establishing a dispute resolution mechanism at expert level, along the lines of a copyright tribunal, in the course of preparing the Bill. My conclusion, however, was that, given the volume of disputes in the relatively small Irish market in respect of copyright protected works and the fact that, in any event, many serious disputes are likely to require the attention of the courts, the establishment of such a body would not be justified in Irish circumstances, either on operational grounds or on the grounds of cost.</P>
    <P>Copyright and related rights holders and the community of users of copyright protected materials should both be aware that I will continue to take an active personal interest in the ongoing interaction between the exercise of the rights of copyright rights holders and those of the users of copyright material. Should further measures in the area of dispute resolution prove proportionate and necessary on the basis of future developments I will certainly consider them. I respect the validity of Members' comments about the controller's office and the expert level of dispute resolution and the arguments they made in favour of the establishment of a copyright tribunal. We can discuss this matter further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made by Deputies in respect of research which I will certainly consider. For now, however, I must point out that even if researchers do not mind their articles being copied freely, this is not the case for publishers of such material. Publishers are usually the owners of the economic rights relating to published articles and if the economic rights of the publishers of specialist journalists &ndash; these are often quite small &ndash; are undermined, such journals may no longer be published. I am concerned about <Col N="1117" /> such a development because it would hardly be in the interest of researchers. As a number of Members stated, a balance must be established between the interests of both parties. I remind Deputies to take the rights of publishers into account when considering this section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that aspects of the Bill may be in breach of the proposed EU directive on copyright in the information society. I assume this refers in particular to the scope of exceptions which might be allowed by the directive, if and when it comes into force. Apart from that question, I am of the view that the Bill is in conformity which the proposed directive addresses. The important word here is &ldquo;proposed&rdquo;. This directive is still in a draft stage and I understand that the views of members of the European Parliament are currently being considered by a working group of the Council, on which my Department is represented.</P>
    <P>The Government is not currently in a position to accept formulations of the draft directive which would seriously undermine exceptions to copyright, which form an important part of the essential balance that has developed in Ireland between rights holders interests and those of users of copyright material. Nor do we favour limitations on the right of member states to adapt their regimes of exceptions to meet new challenges generated by further and unforeseen developments in the information society. Nor, indeed, do we accept current formulations which include the concept of &ldquo;fair compensation&rdquo;. I also understand that Ireland is far from alone among member states in having difficulties on these points. Should it prove necessary to introduce further legislation to adapt our copyright law to the requirements of new EU legislation, the Government will do so promptly. We cannot and will not attempt to introduce measures tailored to the shifting requirements of a draft text particularly where the features of the text in question require further serious consideration. We already have a large agenda with which to deal but I accept that people may have concerns about future developments.</P>
    <P>I referred to copyright collection societies in my opening contribution. There is a perception that some societies use their remit to exercise copyright rights on a collective basis on behalf of their members in a heavy-handed manner. A number of Deputies quoted instances of this happening. It must be remembered that these societies have an important function in the system of copyright protection. Without them, many rights, such as copyright interests in music and performers' rights, could not be effectively exercised since the only way for most rights holders to exercise such rights is on a collective basis through a collecting society. I referred earlier to struggling young musicians and performers and it is important that there should be a body to look after their interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> It is essential in this as in other areas of business that parties conduct themselves reasonably and courteously towards each other. Therefore, I appeal to all collecting societies to persevere in what is, in general, their reasonable, courteous and business like approach to the conduct of their operations, which must be conducive to the efficient and effective achievement of their objectives. One area of the relationship between collecting societies and users of copyright material which can cause difficulties relates to the problem often experienced by the latter group in obtaining information on the former. It is for this reason that I propose, through the Bill, to introduce registration schemes for licensing bodies dealing with copyright performers' property rights and database rights. These registers, which will be kept by the Controller of Patents, Design and Trademarks, will provide users of copyright materials and the public at large with easy access to basic information on the registered societies, including the names of their offices, the classes of rights holders they represent and the scale of charges they apply.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that registration of collecting societies be made compulsory. I could not accept that suggestion because it would amount to a formal precondition to the exercise of copyright rights and such formalities are not permitted under international law. I am advised, however, that collecting societies that have been in contact with the Department in respect of this matter have generally accepted the value of the proposed registration system in improving public knowledge of copyright rights in general and public appreciation of the role and value of the societies in particular. I am confident, therefore, that, while voluntary, the new registers will attract a comprehensive range of collecting societies to register and will be successful in their intended purpose of informing the public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the copyright protection of software and software patenting and he put forward an argument about copying versus reproduction. Protecting computer software has been the subject of considerable debate recently. It was touched on in the Seanad and it is a debate I follow with interest. It is, however, important to recognise that, as the law now stands, copyright is the normal basis which protects intellectual property rights in computer programmes. This is underscored by the EU computer programme directive and in international law by the World Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty of December 1996. Both of these instruments require that computer programmes be protected under copyright as literary works in accordance with article 2 of the Berne Convention on Copyright and we are obliged to give effect to the provisions of these instruments in Irish law.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that copyright is an inappropriate means of protecting intellectual property interests in computer programmes. Computer programmes are normally written in languages <Col N="1119" /> which, while specialist, are none the less literary in the sense that they can be written in a form immediately comprehensible to an informed reader. To protect electronic representations of computer programmes is no more unreasonable or illogical than protecting electronic representations of any other class of copyright work. Protection of this sort is secured by this Bill because without it copyright protection in the age of digital storage and communication would be seriously undermined.</P>
    <P>More important is that copyright offers substantial advantages as a means of protecting software. It can protect computer programmes without the need for the elaborate formalities associated with patenting and this is important in view of the rapid evolution characteristic of computer programmes. As regards open source programming, it is a matter for the rights holders whether they want to assert their rights. They must have that option.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about the proceedings against Ireland under article 169 of the EC treaty. A number of such actions were commenced. Judgment against Ireland was recently delivered in the first of these actions with costs but not damages. The other actions are proceeding. The European Commission has advised that such actions, once commenced, must follow their course. It would be fair to say that the actions against Ireland have not been rapidly pressed. A failure to transpose the directives by the enactment of this Bill in the near future, however, will undoubtedly encourage the Commission and the European Court of Justice to take a harsher view.</P>
    <P>The question of whether there is a need to define the Internet for the purpose of this Bill has been raised. I have carefully considered the matter and for the time being this would be neither necessary nor desirable. Deputies will note that the reference to the term &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; in the context of the &lsquo;making available' right is an including reference. The &lsquo;making available' right does not depend on a definition of any particular means of making a work available to the public. There is also the practical difficulty that there is not an agreed definition of the Internet. Attempts to define it could run to several pages. In this context it would appear safer and more practical to rely on the self-defining character of the Internet and on commonsense than to attempt a legal definition. Having said that, I accept that it may become necessary to settle on a legal definition, not so much of the Internet, but of electronic communications networks in general for copyright purposes in the longer term.</P>
    <P>This is a complex question. Different networks with different levels of access may raise different copyright issues through their operation. For example, the copyright consequences of carrying material on a network internal to a library or group of libraries may be different from the consequences of carriage on the open Internet. This matter is being examined by officials in the con<Col N="1120" /> text of current negotiations on the proposed EU directive on copyright and the information society. I will keep a close eye on the deliberations and if they suggest a need for a more precise definition of electronic networks for copyright purposes, the House can be sure that I will act accordingly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen raised the matter of belated realisation. The Department has been carrying out consultative work with interest groups for four years. I published a draft Bill on 1 July. A large volume of new submissions was then considered by the Department. Interests such as the Business Software Association, the newspaper industry and the music industry were out of the traps quickly in making submissions. Others have come later to the debate but that does not mean they will be treated any differently. If people put forward sensible proposals they will be considered. The submissions were examined and, as a result, the Bill has been changed along the way &ndash; modestly in some areas and more comprehensively in others. I will look at all submissions. That is why the Bill has taken so long.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies for their co-operation today and look forward to close scrutiny of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the level of growth we have experienced in recent years and the maintenance of our competitive edge will be substantially influenced for the better if we are able to achieve a more dispersed pattern of growth than we have seen in recent years. There should be a better spread of economic and social growth across the State and a more even spread of infrastructural provisions. It is vital that there should be a clear plan in place to take care of this. In saying that I welcome the Fine Gael plan for the nation, with its vision of Ireland in 2010.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to have a plan to manage economic growth. The Fine Gael plan tackles six key national tasks: the planning and development of housing and transport infrastructure; the provision of a health system which looks after all <Col N="1121" /> people; the well-being and education of children from birth to adulthood; the structure and volume of taxation; the preservation of the environment; the provision recreational living facilities for people and the foreseeable physical needs of the nation.</P>
    <P>Already twice as many new houses per head of population are being built here as in other EU member states. This places immense strain on roads, schools, buses, recreational amenities and waste disposal facilities. It has been estimated that we will have to build 38,000 new houses a year between now and 2006 and 40,000 new houses per year between 2006 and 2011.</P>
    <P>To qualify its housing need, the Government will also have to decide on its immigration policy. According to the ESRI, if we want to maintain current rates of economic growth, we will have to actively encourage immigration. If current rates of economic growth are to be maintained, immigration must be actively encouraged and that is a conscious choice which we must make. Without immigration, labour shortage will slow growth rates. The ESRI stated that &ldquo;The exceptionally high growth rates are not sustainable without a permanent inflow of immigrants&rdquo;. Consequently, immigrants must be housed. For every 10,000 immigrants, the demand for housing increases by 3,000 dwellings. The Government should, therefore, estimate and provide for a specified level of immigration during the period 2000-10.</P>
    <P>If 40,000 houses per year are to be built over the next ten years, it is likely that two thirds will be built on land that is not yet serviced. A total of 27,000 acres will need to be serviced at a cost of £10,000 per acre. As much as possible of this servicing should be done early in the ten year plan to increase house supply and reduce house prices. The Government must set out to increase supply so dramatically that it forces back the current escalating trend in house prices.</P>
    <P>These services cannot be provided willy nilly when pressure is put on. A conscious plan is needed to build up certain nodes of development that are alternative to centres like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, where road networks are already so much over capacity that commuting times to work almost invariably exceed 30 minutes. The ESRI identified a number of developable centres to which drive times to work are less than 30 minutes &ndash; Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar, Athlone, Tralee, Kilkenny, Portlaoise and Dundalk. Other towns may make a case to be considered as nodes of development. There should be a deliberate plan to provide serviced land, recreational and educational facilities, and radial transport to these towns so that they can develop a new centre alternative to the already overcrowded centres mentioned. This is a political choice which must be made at the outset of the plan. There is no point leaving such a national decision to the vagaries of the market and the preferences of property developers.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that the sense of community must be strengthened because it is being lost in <Col N="1122" /> urban Ireland. Many do not know their neighbours, of if they do, they feel no sense of responsibility for their neighbours' lives. Yet neighbourhoods were and are the loci for most of Ireland's voluntary effort in the sporting, charitable, social and religious fields. There is an increasing disjunction between the community of work and that of home. As people are forced to commute 50 or 60 miles or up to three hours per day to and from work, they have no time left to develop neighbourhood activities. The work community, therefore, is the only one that they have and if they lose their job that is gone. The Government has a role to require the distribution of homes and jobs in close conjunction with one another throughout the country in a way that will allow natural local communities to grow and prosper. We need to breathe life into the neighbourhoods and the civil parishes in our cities.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will draw up a spatial residential plan for Ireland. Such a plan designating the places where facilities should be provided for people to live and work to integrate both and provide the best services with the least environmental damage is needed. The plan should outline where and how waste is to be disposed of and our national water supplies are to be protected. The space in which we live is too precious to be left to vagaries of random planning applications to a multiplicity of local authorities. Unless there is a national residential plan we will have houses that are not homes because they lack the surrounding facilities.</P>
    <P>A village environment is normally associated with a rural setting but such a community can also develop and be encouraged in cities. The need to allow people to associate naturally with their neighbours should be a key element of the physical redesign of urban areas and existing villages. Villages are one of the basic building blocks of our community with 40 per cent of the population living in a rural environment. The number of towns with a population between 1,500 and 5,000 should be doubled between now and 2010 as part of this process of natural community development.</P>
    <P>Such a plan could be financed by Irish housing bonds floated at a fixed rate over a 30 year term which would be attractive to global institutions and reduce the risk to public finance of short-term market fluctuations. The plan should outline where and how the State will assist the growth of regional centres, by deliberately assisting the development of recreational, sporting and lifestyle enhancing facilities in those centres to which it wishes to attract people to live. If we are not proactive in spreading these facilities around the country, our great capital city, Dublin, will simply choke to death.</P>
    <P>Currently the planning system works on the basis of planning authorities refusing some applications and granting others. It is a negative process and is developer-led. The Government gives no lead because it has no national vision of the pattern of settlement it wants for the country. As <Col N="1123" /> a result there are areas close to Dublin, upon which no houses have been built, while people commute 60 miles or more to work there. This is foolish.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes the railway system should be deliberately chosen by the Government as the primary artery of national development and, as far as possible, houses and businesses should be built close to the rail network to put the maximum amount of traffic into that network and off the roads. It must be upgraded to halve rail journey times. For example, the journey time from Waterford to Dublin should be cut to 90 minutes from the current two hours and 40 minutes. This should be a deliberate national policy and the zoning decisions of councils should follow this priority. Councils should not be allowed to demand improved rail and transport links unless they are willing to provide for high density housing close to those links, especially near railway stations and this must be managed centrally.</P>
    <P>Services provided by Government should be decentralised along the railway lines and priority should be given to the concentration of top grade broad band telecommunication facilities in conjunction with railway lines so that houses and offices built nearby can have maximum IT efficiency. As part of this process, entire Departments should be moved from Dublin. For example, there is no reason the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and its Minister should not operate from one of the nodes of development identified earlier. While Dáil Éireann should continue to meet in Dublin there is no reason the Constitution should not provide that Seanad Éireann should meet in a location outside Dublin, such as Galway, Athlone, Dundalk or Limerick.</P>
    <P>Cities need to be turned inside out. If more offices are built in the suburbs and more high rise or high density homes built in the city centre there will be much better use of our transport links, with buses and trains filled as they travel in both directions in the morning and evening. Park and ride facilities will work only if there are parking spaces. The Government has failed to provide suburban parking to complement quality bus corridors and this is a betrayal of commuters. The Minister for Public Enterprise procrastinated on Luas and then produced a compromise between the underground and overground options. Many believe that she will eventually have to abandon that grossly expensive and time wasting compromise. She will spend £400 million extra in taxpayers' money and it will not carry one extra passenger. It is critically urgent to reduce the damage done to health and lifestyles by excessive commuting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The provisional total numbers on in-patient waiting lists on 30 September 1999, shortly before the nurses dispute commenced, are now to hand. They stood at 33,381, a decrease of 343 over the figure for 30 June. This brings to 3,302 the reduction in numbers since the beginning of the year. My Department sought initial total figures on the number of persons awaiting in-patient treatment on 31 October 1999, some days after the ending of the industrial action. These figures are provisional estimates only and will be subject to validation. They indicate that there was a total of 37,200 on in-patient waiting lists on 31 October, an increase of 3,619 over the September figure. Information provided by the health boards and hospitals during the course of the industrial action indicated that approximately 3,300 procedures were cancelled during the dispute.</P>
      <P>Since the conclusion of the nurses dispute my Department has been working with the health agencies to ensure that services to patients return to normal as quickly as possible. This includes measures to address any backlogs emerging as a result of the industrial action.</P>
      <P>My Department has invited all agencies concerned to a series of meetings tomorrow morning to establish in detail from them the current position in relation to their activity levels and the arrangements they propose to make to ensure that their service plan targets are met by the end of this year. My Department has already emphasised to agencies the importance of achieving these targets by using their resources to maximum effect. This would include optimising the use of theatres, streamlining discharge arrangements, maximising the use of step-down and convalescent facilities and encouraging appropriate staff to participate fully in local plans to meet targets for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> I am determined to ensure that services to patients are delivered as efficiently and effectively as possible and that all agencies work intensively to achieve normal services following the recent industrial action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that waiting lists as at 31 October, standing at 37,200, are the highest for some years? Will he accept his negotiations with the nursing unions and the outcome achieved should have been undertaken at a much earlier stage to avoid the disastrous increase in the waiting lists, which can best be described as an escalated waiting list crisis? Will he indicate how many consultation appointments, arranged with consultants attached to various hospitals during the course of the strike, were cancelled and if any action plan will be put in place to ensure the waiting lists are substantially reduced as rapidly as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having inherited an escalating waiting lists problem, we not only stabilised it but were starting to reduce it for the first time in five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it is worse, having had an industrial dispute. Any major statement by the Deputy that the waiting lists would increase does not require any great insight on his part. Clearly the nine-day industrial action, the biggest in the history of the State, has had a detrimental effect on the downward trend in waiting lists which was continuing as at 30 September. Having obtained the factual position, so far as we can gauge, at 31 October the waiting lists are significantly lower than the figures bandied about by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and by Opposition politicians who seem to have the ability to gauge the increase without having the facts available to them. It is ironic, they may be disappointed that 3,619 were delayed or postponed rather than a figure of, I think, 12,000 mentioned by the Deputy at some stage.</P>
      <P>Clearly the biggest industrial action in the history of the State has had an impact. The impact was assessed at 3,619. With a view to getting back to normal service levels as quickly as possible we have arranged for a series of meetings as and from tomorrow morning to see how we can meet service plan targets before the end of the year. This figure, which has come about as a result of the worst industrial action, is a setback. However, it does not take from our comprehensive way we are dealing with the waiting list initiative, as a result of our task force report and the increased resources put into this area, not only in acute hospital services but in the wider services for the elderly etc., which will be evidenced from the Estimates returns today, confirming that the commitment of the Government has been strengthened in dealing with this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, in believing he inherited a problem, he must be one of the few people who do not believe that he managed, through his own incompetence, to exacerbate it enormously to a stage where waiting lists have lengthened despite a Government commitment to tackle the problem? The strike has deepened the existing problem to an extraordinary degree. The Minister did not answer the previous question which was about out-patient appointments. What are the details regarding out-patient appointments? My understanding is that approximately one third of out-patient appointments are first time appointments as opposed to recalls. Will the Minister assure the House there is a timeframe to ensure that those first time appointments, at the very least, will be cleared well before Christmas? Will he agree it is extraordinarily tardy to have a meeting tomorrow &ndash; it should have been held last week &ndash; to ensure the agencies have in place practical measures, including the extension of out-patient clinic times and the setting up of emergency sessions at night time, weekends or whatever? The Minister should ensure hospital services do not wind down as early as usual for the Christmas period but that work is carried on to the latest possible date in December. Is he aware of rumours that Tullamore hospital, in his constituency, will wind down procedures from 1 December? Surely he would consider this is grossly unacceptable, given the waiting lists for elective procedures and out-patient clinic appointments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the local situation, Tullamore hospital is one of the most efficient hospitals in implementing its service plans. It received £300,000 from the money I had held back under the waiting list initiative, as a result of the progress being made by hospitals in regard to waiting lists. For those who are interested in the Deputy's views on Laoighis-Offaly, we will be making an unprecedented investment in the Midland Health Board area to ensure the regional insufficiencies, which existed during her administration, are dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I make that point just in case the Deputy wants to raise local issues. I have answered the question that I have been asked to deal with, which is related to the numbers on the waiting lists. I do not have the other figures sought by the Deputy in respect of the numbers on outpatient waiting lists but they can be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nine day all-out strike has had an effect <Col N="1127" /> but, to the disappointment of the Opposition, not to the extent that there are 45,000 on the waiting lists, the figure mentioned in a daily newspaper today. Journalists should sometimes recognise that individuals have a vested interest in suggesting that the numbers are higher than they are in an attempt to obtain more funds for their members and are not as objective as they claim to be. Up to the commencement of the strike there was a continuing reduction in the numbers on the waiting lists &ndash; 9 per cent since the beginning of the year, the first reduction year on year in four years.</P>
    <P>The Deputy used the word &ldquo;tardy&rdquo;. The Administration of which she was a member witnessed a rise of more than one third in the short period it was in office. There is not any question of tardiness. Since the ending of the strike I have indicated to all managements and agencies that there is a need to resume normal services as quickly as possible. I took the opportunity to meet the Nursing Alliance earlier this week to reassure it on the need to move forward positively on the issues it wants addressed. All managements have been in touch with the Department outlining their scenario in writing. We will discuss with them tomorrow everything that can be done to enhance services for the remainder of the year to clear the backlog which has arisen from the unprecendented all-out nurses strike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the manner in which he dealt with this issue has had disastrous human consequences for those waiting &ndash; some for many months, others for a number of years &ndash; for essential surgery? Is he telling the House that he does not know how many outpatient appointments have been cancelled and how many patients awaiting to see a consultant for the first time have been left waiting? What arrangements have been made to clear the backlog? Does the Minister know how many patients are affected?</P>

We have to take cognisance of the work which has been done in the interim report and see what further work needs to be done as part of an information gathering exercise. I take the point the Deputy makes in relation to the non-co-operation by the industry with the requirements seeking the disclosure of ingredients in tobacco products, and I have indicated that that is now a matter for the Attorney General to report to the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) in Dublin 16 was advised on 20 November 1998 that she had contracted hepatitis C through anti-D and has been informed by VHI and BUPA that, in view of the fact she had a pre-existing medical condition, she must wait five years before she can obtain health insurance; and the steps, if any, he will take to have this insurance made available to her and to other people in a similar position at an earlier date without the prescribed waiting time.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23071/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The health insurance regulations give insurers the discretion to impose waiting periods on the payment of benefit in respect of persons taking out insurance cover for the first time. The regulations, however, set maximum waiting periods which cannot be exceeded by insurers. In the normal course, the maximum waiting period is 26 weeks if the person is under the age of 55 or 52 weeks if the person is over 55. Where the person suffers from a pre-existing condition at the time of taking out cover, the maximum waiting period for the payment of benefit which relates to claims arising from that condition is five years if the person is under 55, seven years for those aged 55 to 60 and ten years for those aged 60 to 65.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the periods of exclusion in relation to pre-existing conditions do not apply to claims which are unrelated to these conditions. Such claims are subject only to the initial waiting periods of 26 weeks or 52 weeks, depending on age. An insured person, therefore, can avail of health insurance benefits for conditions which are not pre-existing once the initial waiting period has passed.</P>
      <P>In relation to hepatitis C, as the Deputy is aware, secondary health care services for persons who contracted hepatitis C through the administration within the State of blood and blood products have been provided without charge since February 1994 in designated units. These units are based in Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital, St. James's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny, Cork University Hospital, and University College Hospital in Galway. These services include access to in-patient and out-patient services as required, including access to a hospital bed. The services also include prompt primary referral from a liver consultant to another consultant for the purposes of testing, investigation or treatment of any known or suspected condition related to hepatitis C, or any condition which, while not related to hepatitis C, requires special treatment or care as a result of the person's infection with hepatitis C. Such appointments are given as a priority, normally within two weeks. Follow-up appointments are arranged on the basis of medical need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not received a request from the representative groups, namely, Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Haemophilia Society or the Irish Kidney Association, to address the hepatitis C health service needs of their members in the context of health insurance. In my opinion this is because the standard of care being provided through the designated units is of the highest quality, access is readily available and the services are provided without charge. There is also a high level of user satisfaction with the <Col N="1132" /> services. The representative groups are aware of my commitment to further develop existing services to meet the on-going needs of persons infected with hepatitis C. The person referred to by the Deputy is entitled to these services, and should she have any concerns in relation to the services available to her, she should contact the blood policy division in my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department has contracted with Mercer Limited, actuaries and consultants, to provide expert advice in relation to difficulties being experienced in obtaining insurance cover, including the issue of health insurance cover, by certain persons infected with hepatitis C. The representative groups are participating in this exercise and the report from the consultants is expected to be completed next month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that a person who has contracted hepatitis C as a result of a contaminated anti-D product being made available to them by the Blood Transfusion Service Board should not be penalised by the health insurance companies if they seek to take out health insurance? Will the Minister acknowledge there may well be conditions unrelated to hepatitis C for which they wish to have health insurance cover for future years? As those who contracted hepatitis C were in no way at fault for doing so &ndash; they contracted it as a result of the gross negligence of a State agency &ndash; the Minister should introduce rules which direct the health insurance groupings, both the VHI and BUPA, to waive the waiting periods in the context of people who find themselves in this position.</P>

      <P>We have designated units providing excellent services free of charge and, therefore, the specific issue the Deputy raises in relation to a particular person who made representations to him has a recourse which may be simpler than amending the existing open enrolment regulations under the Health Insurance Act, 1994. In general under the health insurance system there are pre-existing conditions and waiting periods and the detail of any problem this person is experiencing could be dealt with through the blood policy unit which would be anxious to facilitate her in any way it can with whatever problem she has to see if it can be solved in the way I suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>In our opinion there is a remedy to the case raised. On the more general question, without reference to the problem raised in this <Col N="1133" /> question, the counter issue from the health insurance industry is that the insurer must be in a position to protect its business from adverse selection whereby a person having the knowledge of an increased likelihood to claim benefits in the immediate or short-term signs on with an insurer. The 1996 regulations, which are currently in effect, strike a balance between the interests of the consumer and the provision of a limited or reasonable protection for insurers in combating adverse selection practices and managing their business on a prudent basis. It would not be right for me to give a unilateral indication without discussion with the health insurance industry in a way that does not compromise legitimate interests on its part where it would have a more general application than this specific case.</P>

      <Quest>the health agencies, if any, which had, at 1 November 1999, failed to achieve year 2000 compliance of systems and equipment; the year 2000 compliance work which remains to be done by health agencies; the agencies concerned; and the likelihood of their achieving year 2000 compliance by 31 December 1999.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1997 my Department has been working with health agencies to ensure year 2000 compliance in the health service. My Department has undertaken an overall role of co-ordinating, assisting and facilitating the sharing of information and monitoring progress. Each health agency has its own Y2K project structure in place and the Y2K remediation programme is now drawing to a close. My Department has authorised expenditure amounting to approximately £25 million for the repair or replacement of non-compliant systems and equipment.</P>
      <P>Formal returns from health agencies are received on the 25th of each month reflecting the position at the end of the previous month. Accordingly, the latest formal returns reflect the Y2K status in health agencies at the end of September. My Department's assessment of these returns is that at this stage in excess of 90 per cent of the technical remediation work has been completed. When account is taken of the fact that the most critical items have generally been dealt with first, this indicates that the workload remaining was quite small and related to the less critical items.</P>
      <P>However, Y2K is a complex issue in a health care setting. It involves making all reasonable efforts to ensure that systems and equipment will continue to function normally and having adequate contingency plans in place as an added assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main focus of activity is now on business continuity and contingency planning and this is taking place in a structured and co-ordinated way. This includes preparations for the expected increased demand for services over the millen<Col N="1134" /> nium changeover period. It is also necessary to continue to make staff aware of the issues and this awareness training will continue up to the millennium changeover.</P>
    <P>My Department's objectives are to ensure that there is no risk to the health and safety of health service clients and staff arising from the Y2K problem and that demands for service are met. I am confident these objectives will be achieved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The scope of the problem covers information technology like computers, medical equipment and devices, estates, plant and machinery in buildings, telephone and pager systems, lifts, operating theatres, air conditioners and the supply chain. It is necessary to consider the ability of the suppliers of critical or perishable goods to maintain continuity of supply over the millennium period, i.e. that their systems are year 2000 compliant. A great deal of work has been done on that and various special interest groups were set up in relation to information technology, medical devices, estates, laboratory equipment, small agencies, the supply chain, business continuity and planning.</P>
      <P>The guidelines set out and the methodology used to approach this problem recommended the risk management approach, which involved categorising systems and items of equipment into various categories of risk, ranging from life threatening to minimal. In this way, the effort can be directed to the highest risk areas first. All those critical issues have been dealt with. We are now dealing with the question of ensuring continuity of supply over the period and contingency planning for the expected increased demand in accident and emergency services, etc. The technical issues regarding Y2K compliance of equipment have been dealt with and we are now dealing with the logistics of average coverage, etc.</P>

What does that 10 per cent relate to? Are we talking here about health boards or other agencies? Will the Minister clarify the agencies to which he is referring and to what this outstanding 10 per cent of work specifically relates, in the context of year 2000 compliance work?</P>

All that logistical work has been done. Any issues which were identified at the beginning of this process in early 1997, where people felt there would be a life threatening risk, have been dealt with, in so far as they can be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has been experiencing difficulties in the provision of services in its regional orthodontic department in St. James's Hospital in recent months. I understand from the board that these difficulties have been caused by the consultant orthodontist's unilateral decision to withdraw from the provision of orthodontic assessments, orthodontic opinions and the commencement of orthodontic appliance therapy for new patients. The position was exacerbated more recently by the withdrawal of consultant cover and the consultant orthodontist's refusal to provide guidance to dental clinicians regarding orthodontic procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite negotiations and discussion at the <Col N="1136" /> highest level in the Eastern Health Board, the consultant orthodontist has persistently refused to provide services as outlined. I now understand that the consultant orthodontist's actions have led to her suspension from duty without pay with effect from 4 November 1999.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is now in the process of ensuring that appropriate arrangements are put in place to provide continuity of orthodontic service as heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that appointments are currently not being given by the Eastern Health Board for orthodontic assessments for children? Will he confirm that, as of 31 March 1999, there were 6,418 patients in the Eastern Health Board area awaiting such assessment? Will he clarify why, in reply to a Dáil question some two and a half weeks ago about the number of children on orthodontic assessment waiting lists in the Eastern Health Board area, he said there were 83 in total, compared with some 6,000 on the Southern Health Board waiting list, with no explanation provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised the last part of his question without notice. I will get whatever explanation exists for that.</P>
      <P>As I stated, there was a particularly problematic position in the Eastern Health Board in relation to the consultant orthodontist's refusal to do the work assigned to her. On the need to improve the orthodontic services generally in the Eastern Health Board area, as a result of this suspension without pay, the board is in discussion with its specialist orthodontic staff with regard to the provision of full cover for patients.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board also proposes to develop two further orthodontic units at Loughlinstown and Beaumont hospitals. Capital funding of £1,060,000 for the Loughlinstown unit is being provided by the Department and it will be ready before the end of this year. The Beaumont unit will cost more than £2 million. A brief has been submitted and is under consideration in the Department. The development of these units will make a significant contribution to the orthodontic service in the board's area. There is an historic problem in relation to dental services and there will be increased provision in the Estimates for it, to be announced this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister have to say to the estimated 8,000 children &ndash; it is an estimated figure because we do not have the up to date figures &ndash; and their parents who are awaiting appointments for orthodontic assessment from the Eastern Health Board? When will they be given appointments? When is it likely that the treatment they need will be undertaken? How will this issue be resolved, in the context of these difficulties having initially occurred six months ago? Why is it that every parent who contacts the health board to find out the likely timeframe within which their sons or daughters will be <Col N="1137" /> assessed, is simply informed they can be told nothing? Does the Minister agree that is a totally unsatisfactory situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, there has been an unsatisfactory situation in regard to the Eastern Health Board because of a specific industrial relations problem. I do not want to comment any further on that, other than in the basic information I have given to the House on the current position.</P>
      <P>In regard to orthodontic services in the health services generally, there are seven consultant orthodontists available to health boards and to the unit in St. James' Hospital. They are supported by 40 dental surgeons, trained under the direction and supervision of the consultant. I recently consented to the recognition of orthodontics as a speciality for registration by the Dental Council. It is now a matter for the Dental Council to decide on the formal structures for training specialist orthodontists. There was a considerable level of disagreement between the hospitals and the orthodontic consultants about the training modules which were to be used to ensure that we can get more trained people in this area to do the increasing level of work required. We are now proceeding to deal with that issue.</P>
      <P>However, I take the point that we have had an unsatisfactory situation in relation to the dental services, generally, for a long time. There will be increased provision in the Estimates this year to try to deal with that historic problem. The backlog will not be resolved in the immediate future but it will be improved upon, based on some recent decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and administration of the national blood transfusion service rests with the Blood Transfusion Service Board. The background to this matter is as follows.</P>
      <P>In May 1995 a strategy to consolidate donor testing to a single location was recommended to the board of the BTSB following a major consultancy exercise undertaken by Bain Consultants. The Government at that time agreed to fund this exercise in order to improve the management and organisation of the BTSB. In May 1995 the board unanimously adopted the recommendations in the report. A significant number of these recommendations has been implemented, involving substantial investment in equipment and premises, a new IT system and new scientific and technical posts. The report recognised that the current IT system was a barrier to implementation of single site testing. In this regard a new IT system will be operational shortly as a result of an investment of approximately £4 million.</P>
      <P>In February 1998 the BTSB decided that PCR testing should be introduced to further improve blood safety. In line with international experience, the board decided that PCR testing at both centres could not be justified and that it would, therefore, be introduced at its new national headquarters. This will involve testing blood samples from all donations in the country in the national headquarters. In light of this decision and other anticipated developments in transfusion medicine, the board requested the chief executive officer and the national medical director to assess whether all serological testing, not just PCR testing, should be centralised. A report to the board by external consultants in April 1998 on the review of the Cork facility also recommended that the centralisation of testing activities should be kept under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As requested by the board, the chief executive officer and the national medical director undertook a detailed examination to assess whether all serological testing should be centralised. Their report strongly recommended the development of <Col N="1139" /> single site testing. This recommendation was unanimously adopted by the board which is satisfied from its own experience and from the experience of international transfusion centres that it can meet on time and without fail the blood component needs of hospitals nationally from a single testing site. The board authorised the executive to proceed with the detailed planning for single site testing. The board has committed itself to consultation with blood users in the Munster region in order to address their concerns.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a group of health care providers in Munster prepared the report referred to by the Deputies. The group presented it to the board of the BTSB at its meeting in Cork on 13 October last. I understand that the board considered the report in detail at its meeting yesterday and that the chairperson of the BTSB will be responding to the group shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, during the recent strike, blood platelet supplies in Dublin ran short and could not be provided by the BTSB? Is he also aware that 70 pools of platelets for use in heart bypass operations and the treatment of leukaemia, especially for children, were supplied by the Cork unit? Will he accept that this incident demonstrates the need to maintain a back-up, complete service in Cork to ensure that if there are difficulties with the new BTSB unit in Dublin the provision of blood and blood products can be made up by a full and comprehensive service, including a testing service, continuing to operate in Cork? This unit would normally service the Munster region but would also be available as a fallback in the event of difficulties with the Dublin service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Experience shows not as the Deputy suggests but that testing is improved by having one centralised testing centre. It is not suggested that the Munster centre will no longer operate. Under the BTSB proposals being considered, based on consultants' reports, the Munster centre will continue to have a role in the provision of blood supplies. The Deputy would not suggest that the distance between Letterkenny General Hospital, for example, and Dublin and Cork militates against a proper blood supply. Clearly that is not the case. As a result of problems in the past, the BTSB has sought independent consultants' advice to provide for a modernisation of the service. The Munster centre will not be obliterated in that process but will continue to have a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that changes such as these should be made once the issue of a consistency of blood supply is sorted out? Surely he is concerned by the fact that, as a result of his mishandling of the nurses dispute, there were pickets outside the BTSB resulting in a shortage of blood supplies. This is not the first time we have had such a shortage. Does the Mini<Col N="1140" /> ster accept he has a responsibility to ensure that blood supplies are maintained and secured into the future before changes are made regarding testing centres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The political composition of a Government does not determine the level of blood supply. The BTSB depends on the voluntary donation of blood by the public. The role of any Minister or Government is to ensure that the public continues to have confidence in the BTSB and continues to provide the levels of donations required to ensure security of supply. This issue has nothing to do with the number of testing centres. That is a different issue. As a result of a public appeal by the BTSB, there was full co-operation from all concerned, including nurses. From time to time the BTSB makes public appeals requesting donations because of an anticipated demand in days or weeks ahead. That has been a common feature of the operations of the BTSB.</P>

    <P>The increased level of notifications of bacterial meningitis and related conditions in recent years is in part attributable to the greatly increased awareness among health professionals and the general public, as well as improved techniques for <Col N="1141" /> diagnosis of the condition. Nonetheless, while there continues to be much research in relation to meningitis, it is not fully understood why Ireland experiences such a different pattern of disease from other countries in Europe and elsewhere. It should be noted that, despite the increased incidence of meningitis, there has not been a corresponding increase in mortality from this condition.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on Bacterial Meningitis, which was established in 1996 under the chairmanship of my Department's deputy chief medical officer, published its first report in 1997, making a wide range of recommendations on such issues as the surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of meningitis. In the course of reviewing that report this year, the group found that these recommendations had been extensively implemented by the different interests involved. The group has recently published an updated report and this includes detailed template guidelines on the management of meningitis in the hospital setting. These guidelines are intended to be adapted as considered necessary to meet local circumstances in individual hospitals. The working group is a standing committee and will continue to review the situation and make further recommendations as it considers necessary on the management and prevention of this serious and distressing condition.</P>
    <P>On public education, the health boards, in conjunction with voluntary bodies, have conducted extensive educational campaigns on meningococcal disease. There continues to be close liaison between the health boards and the voluntary bodies concerned, principally the Meningitis Research Foundation. The health promotion unit has produced an updated information leaflet and in 1998 a video entitled Meningitis: Prompt Action Saves Lives was produced by the Office for Health Gain in conjunction with the Meningitis Research Foundation. The Irish College of General Practitioners also designates education officers in each health board area who are in a position to assist in the event of an outbreak of meningococcal infection.</P>
    <P>A new conjugate vaccine to protect against group C meningococcal disease, which represents about 40 per cent of the disease in Ireland, is shortly expected to become available and planning is under way for its introduction into the primary childhood immunisation programme and for it to be given to older children and young people in a catch-up programme. It is also important that, even after the group C vaccine is introduced, vigilance is maintained, as there will still be a significant risk of people contracting group B disease, which represents about 60 per cent of the cases occurring in Ireland at present. I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that it is vital that people are familiar with the symptoms of the disease and of the need to seek immediate medical help from a general practitioner or hospital casualty department where they have cause for concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the fact we have the highest level of meningitis in Europe is a cause of great concern? Will he indicate when the new group C vaccine will be introduced and the reason for the delay in introducing it in the context of it having already been introduced in the UK?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that about ten deaths every year are due to group C infection. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals has developed a new type of group C vaccine which has recently been introduced in the UK. This conjugate vaccine is different from the previous vaccines and is expected to confer prolonged protection against the infection. It requires three doses in infancy and a single dose above 12 months of age. It is intended that the vaccine when licensed should be incorporated into the primary childhood immunisation programme. I have made arrangements in the Estimates for a national immunisation programme as soon as the IMB licences the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Irish Medicines Board taking longer to license the product than its equivalent in the UK? Has the Minister inquired from the board when it will make a decision on the matter? Has he inquired when it is anticipated that a licence will be issued? Given that the vaccine has been introduced in the UK is there any reason it should not be introduced and approved here by the IMB? Will the Minister ask the board to make haste in addressing this issue in the context of the high level of meningitis in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong to suggest there is any dilatory behaviour on the part of the IMB on this issue. It is important to point out that under the European mutual recognition procedure for medicinal products a manufacturer must first obtain a licence from one country, known as the reference member state, and a procedure can then begin for authorisation of the product for use in other member states. That procedure takes between 90 and 120 days from its beginning to final national consensus. In the case of Ireland the IMB is the statutory licensing authority and it must satisfy itself that the product meets the requirements in relation to such issues as safety and efficacy before a product authorisation is granted. On this basis it is likely the vaccine will be licensed for use here by late February or early March 2000. There is a time lag because of the necessity for the manufacturer to first obtain a licence in one country as a reference state, i.e the UK.</P>

      <P>It is for the IMB to satisfy itself and discharge its responsibilities. There is no question of the IMB not doing so as quickly as possible and with due process. It is not fair to suggest the IMB had the application at the same time as the UK as this is not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept people will be puzzled when they hear this when one considers that the IMB was very swift in putting St. John's Wort, for example, on prescription ahead of other European countries while we have to wait until February or March of next year before a decision is made on this vaccine, which is of huge significance in protecting children in particular and in saving lives? The IMB depends on the research of pharmaceutical companies and that is the normal procedure. I ask the Minister to explain why it will take so long for the IMB to assess research which is readily available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>A totally different procedure relates to the matter raised by the Deputy and I do not have the details with me on that. However, I can get the details for her. The relevant procedure in terms of the vaccine is the European mutual recognition procedure for medicinal products, whereby a manufacturer must first obtain a licence in one country. I think this explains why the product is not contemporaneously licensed in all countries. The first country in which a product authorisation licence is granted is the reference country. I cannot explain to the Deputy the background as to why that is the case, but that is the European requirement and that is what is happening in this case.</P>
      <P>The IMB, with a greatly increased workload, has and is doing a very important job in ensuring medicinal products are properly licensed. In the past, parliamentary questions have been tabled asking why the IMB was not doing its job in licensing products. We now have a counter argument in another issue.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he proposes to reduce the hospital waiting lists, particularly for hip replacements in the Midland Health Board area.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office I have tackled the problem of hospital in-patient waiting lists in a strategic and integrated manner. During the first half of this year waiting lists fell by approximately 8 per cent, which is indicative of the success of the strategic way in which I approached this problem. It should be noted that the reductions this year are the first since December 1996. Waiting lists fell again for the September quarter by a further 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> The waiting list for hip replacements in the Midland Health Board at the end of September 1999 was 138. I am pleased to point out that this is a further reduction in the number of people <Col N="1144" /> awaiting hip replacement operations on the June 1999 figure of 143.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this year I allocated the Midland Health Board £870,000 under the waiting list initiative for specific waiting list work. The review group on the waiting list initiative recommended that a portion of the funding available for waiting list work should be retained and allocated later in the year to those agencies which performed best under the waiting list initiative. From this incentive funding, I allocated a further £300,000 to the Midland Health Board in August for further waiting list work.</P>
    <P>The fall in the waiting list for hip replacement procedures in the Midland Health Board area reflects the additional investment that I have made under the waiting list initiative and the integrated approach I have taken to addressing the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. He quoted figures relating to June and September this year. However, he did not go back to the previous year. He said the numbers have fallen, but they have not fallen if one takes the starting figure of 119 in June 1998. In September this year the figure was 138, so therefore there was an increase of about 15 per cent in that period which is quite substantial. Does the Minister agree that the pain and discomfort of people waiting for hip replacements is enormous in terms of immobility, pain and lack of sleep? Many patients awaiting hip operations cannot sleep properly. Some people are waiting up to two years for hip replacement operations in the Midland Health Board area, an area the Minister knows very well. This is totally unacceptable and I ask the Minister to take an initiative to try to reduce the waiting times to a reasonable level. There will be quite a number of operations towards the back end of the year, but I am still told that those longest on the waiting list will probably not have operations at that time. A full review is necessary and I ask the Minister to examine it.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not refer to the waiting lists for ENT in that area which are also particularly long. Again people have been waiting for up to two years for treatment in Tullamore hospital. Has the Minister any initiatives in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have some initiatives in that regard and would appreciate even more vocal support from the Deputy for the capital development proposed for Tullamore General Hospital which will ensure greater throughput for ENT and orthopaedic services. As the Deputy is aware, Tullamore General Hospital has been designated since 1995 as the region's speciality hospital for those services and has not had the level of capital necessary to meet the requirements of which I and the Deputy regularly speak. When one examines the waiting lists one will find they are far longer for Tullamore General Hospital, because it is the regional hospital for those specialities, than for the hospitals in Long<Col N="1145" /> ford-Westmeath or Portlaoise. The waiting list in the hospital in Portlaoise is 109 patients. From memory the waiting list for total procedures in Tullamore General Hospital is more than 1,700. I look forward to the Midland Health Board, Deputies and councillors from the four counties giving full support to the proposed capital investment programme which I have initiated for Tullamore General Hospital to ensure the constituents of the Deputy in Longford-Westmeath and my constituents are provided with a regional speciality which measures up to what is available in other health board areas. One can pick and choose figures from previous dates but I will not refer to the June 1997 or June 1996 figures. We are providing more money for the Midland Health Board area and the Deputy will appreciate, without any special pleading, there has been significant investment in hospital services during my tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will support the Minister with regard to the capital investment. It is badly needed in the area. Tullamore hospital certainly needed capital investment and I support what the Minister is doing there. I hope there will be such investment in other hospitals also. However, I make a special plea to the Minister to examine the hip replacement waiting list. Some people have to wait almost two years and the Minister will appreciate the pain they go through. Lack of sleep is the major problem of people waiting for hip operations. They cannot sleep or lie still because of the pain.</P>
      <P>It will not happen overnight but we should try to reach a stage where hip replacement operations will take place within six months of a patient being put on the waiting list. I urge the Minister to set that as his goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have identified approximately nine target specialties, which include orthopaedics, under the waiting list initiative. This has been of benefit to Tullamore General Hospital in terms of getting more money for the procedures mentioned by the Deputy. There has been a historical backlog in orthopaedic and ENT procedures because the hospital which was designated to carry them out did not get the capital investment necessary to provide the required throughput for regional demand. We are now addressing that problem and it is time we did so. Further work will have to be done in the other two general hospitals as well.</P>

      <Quest>the additional funding, if any, he will provide for DEXA scanners, essential for diagnosis of osteoporosis, of which there are only 12 in the country, in view of the fact that women over 50 have a one in two chance of developing the condition; if he will subvent the cost of a scan, which stands at between £50 and £60; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to a policy of providing improved hospital facilities and services to patients and in this regard I have provided significant capital funding in recent years to health agencies for priority replacement medical equipment. I expect this to be a feature of future health agency funding.</P>
      <P>The diagnosis of osteoporosis is facilitated by bone density measurement which is undertaken by X-ray using DEXA or CT scanners. The DEXA scanner is not essential for the diagnosis of osteoporosis although there are a number in use throughout the acute public hospital system. The main method used is the CT scanner. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that it is a matter for clinical judgment as to which method provides the best diagnosis and for individual health agencies to prioritise their equipment requirements in the light of their service needs.</P>
      <P>There are no charges levied for public patients for DEXA or CT scans in public health facilities. Charges in the order referred to by the Deputy arise in situations where private facilities are availed of by public patients and I have no plans to introduce a system of subvention for such patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the extent and seriousness of this condition? Is he aware, for example, that one in four Irish women over 50 years of age are affected by osteoporosis and, due to the fractures that result from the condition, it is considered the leading cause of death among elderly women? Is he satisfied and can he guarantee that every woman who needs a scan can avail of the facility without payment if she is a GMS patient or a pensioner? This will be news for medical practitioners and organisations who are concerned with osteoporosis. Will the Minister give such a commitment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>No charges are levied on public patients for DEXA or CT scans in public health facilities, but that is not the case in private health facilities. It is due in part to the ageing of the population that osteoporosis is becoming increasingly prevalent in our society. It is an important women's health issue. It is characterised by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, resulting in increased fractures and a consequent increase in mortality and morbidity. The early detection of osteoporosis and recent developments in a number of areas of treatment can substantially reduce fracture events and the cost of medical care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effective clinical osteoporosis service involves a multidisciplinary team of health professionals offering the patient a range of skills, including clinical expertise, diagnostic services, advice on nutrition or exercise and coping with osteoporosis at home and help in regaining mobility and independence following a fracture. <Col N="1147" /> It should be noted that the Department has no applications from hospitals for capital grants for the purchase of DEXA scanners at present, although there are some in the system. The need for equipment in this area will be determined by the health planners and agencies concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not helpful for the Minister to simply read out answers when the question is simple. The screening procedures and facilities for women over 50 who require them is the issue with which I am concerned. Everybody knows osteoporosis can be treated. It is treatable, preventable and even reversible, yet many women suffer from osteoporosis and their disease even goes undetected. The Minister must be aware that the scan is not available as a matter of course for all women over 50 years who need it and who could thereby prevent the condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if the Deputy believes I am not answering her question. The first part of the question asked if additional funding will be provided for DEXA scanners, which she claims are essential for diagnosis of osteoporosis. I stated that there are other scanners, CT scanners, which are equally capable of providing diagnosis of osteoporosis and we have many of them. I have no proposals for additional funding since I have received no requests for it.</P>
      <P>The second part of the question asked if I would subvent the cost of a scan which costs between £50 and £60. I said that will not be done in relation to private facilities. I have also made a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The national suicide study was commissioned by the chief executive officers of the eight health boards in response to the need to determine the reasons for the increase in suicide rates in Ireland. The aims of the study are to establish the incidence and associated factors of suicide nationally in order to inform the present knowledge base on suicides and to provide information to facilitate future planning for suicide prevention programmes. The study has progressed well and is now nearing completion. Data collection has been ongoing since 1997 and, while the study period ended on 31 December 1998, the lag time to inquests meant that the field work to ascertain all the suicides continued into the latter half of 1999. Analysis of the data is due to start in the second half of this month. It is hoped that a full report with recommendations for suicide prevention will be ready by April 2000.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is only in recent times we have even been able to discuss this issue. Traditionally, there was a reluctance to discuss the issue of suicide and parasuicide, which made the compilation of data difficult. This study has progressed well and has attracted considerable support from the Garda, coroners, general medical practitioners and psychiatrists among others, and the report will be completed early next year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that we have the final report of the national task force on suicide, and implementation of its recommendations is aimed at high risk groups that have been identified. I agree the incidence of suicide is seven times greater in young males than young females.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suicide research group has been set up, whose main responsibility is to review the trends <Col N="1149" /> in suicide and parasucide, to co-ordinate research into suicide and make appropriate recommendations to the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>

      <P>I do not have a problem with that. It is in the public interest that such a report should be published and that people should be aware of this phenomenon, which all Members will agree is very worrying. I make that point in relation to the task force recommendations and the recommendations of the National Suicide Research Foundation, which was founded in 1995 by the late Dr. Kelleher. He did a good deal of great work in this area and collected much information on suicide and parasuicide prior to his death some months ago. That foundation recently put forward a proposal for a national monitoring of parasuicide.</P>
      <P>International studies have found parasuicide to be one of the most significant risk factors associated with suicide. Those who engage in parascuide are 20 times more likely to eventually kill themselves and studies have shown that at least one-third of all suicides have a history of parasuicide. Having national information on one of the groups at highest risk of comitting suicide would contribute to Ireland's suicide prevention strategy, and that proposal is currently under consideration by the suicide research group.</P>

The Government has already <Col N="1150" /> allocated an extra £8 million in 1998 and £15 million in 1999 in revenue towards the further development of child care and family support services. The Deputy will be aware that she will have to await the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement for announcements in the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to the further development of child care and family support and problem prevention services has been demonstrated by the wide range of initiatives, which have been undertaken in the past two years. These include the Springboard Initiative, which is being funded from the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund at a cost of £7.2 million over three years. These projects are designed to strengthen the co-ordination and co-operation between statutory and voluntary agencies in providing services for vulnerable children and their families. I have also established teenage parenting support projects in Limerick, Galway and Dublin to identify single young mothers who are considered to be in need of support services, through pregnancy and beyond, for them and their children.</P>
      <P>It is generally agreed that where a child has to be cared for outside his or her own home that, where possible, he or she should be cared for in another family. Last year, I established a working group on foster care to examine all aspects of foster care so as to ensure the further development of this type of care. Membership of the group is made up of nominees from my Department, the health boards, the Irish Foster Care Association and a foster parent. The working group will report to me early in the new year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards overall responsibilities under the 1991 Act in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services. Approximately £3.26 million funding is being provided by the health boards towards the service in 1999, and approximately 7,000 places are currently funded.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>
        </i>In addition, the Government recently published the Children Bill. While this mainly deals with issues concerning juvenile justice, it also provides a statutory basis for the provision of services for children with behavioural difficulties. It provides for the establishment of family welfare conference, which health boards will be obliged to convene, where a child in its area may require special care or protection. The conference will provide a system for the early identification of children at risk and a means of providing support and assistance for the child and his or her family through inter-agency intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Social Services Inspectorate was recently established. The inspectorate initially will concentrate on the child care area, but in the longer term its remit will extend to all the social services. The <Col N="1151" /> main function of the inspectorate is to support the child care services by promoting and ensuring the development of quality standards in the personal social services. Also, the appointment of an ombudsman for children has been identified as a priority and will be a crucial mechanism in vindicating children's rights here. The Government recognises the importance of establishing this mechanism to vindicate the rights of children, as provided for in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and it intends to introduce such a mechanism.</P>
    <P>All of these initiatives underline the Government's continuing commitment to the development of child care and family support services. To strengthen the co-ordination of these services, the Government has decided to develop a national children's strategy to position child and youth related issues more centrally and more explicitly in public policy development and decision-making in a more co-ordinated way. The strategy will also seek to build on the efforts of statutory and voluntary and community agencies in a renewed commitment to develop more child focused services. It will address the needs of children and young people up to the age of 18, with special regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is intended to publish the strategy next year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime to improve cross departmental co-operation on child care issues, a team, drawn from the Departments of Social Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the direction of a principal officer from my Department, has been established.</P>

      <P>Rather than concentrating on individual initiatives and various pilot programmes, will the Minister of State accept that we need to discuss the overall spending trends? Will he give his views on figures released to me recently showing a breakdown of spending in each health board area? The maximum spent in any health board in the area of prevention is 20 per cent of overall funding, which dropped to as low as 8 per cent in the Southern Health Board. Does he accept health boards are given very little discretion in terms of spending on children's services, having regard to the urgency of the child welfare and protection service. A health board does not have the luxury of being able to decide it will spend money on prevention work rather than giving it to social workers to help reduce the lengthening waiting lists for services. Health boards do not have much discretion in terms of such spending, and yet they must provide fire brigade emergency services. They require substantial additional funding, if they are to make an impact in the prevention and family support area. Will the Minister of State indicate his intentions in the spread of funding between emergency and prevention services, what spread would he like to achieve <Col N="1152" /> and how much would he like to increase funding for the family and child support area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the health boards do not have sufficient discretion because, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, there is a pressing need for investigative work and to deal with the continuing crisis, but there has been considerable improvement in this area. While I accept the figure of 20 per cent is correct, additional moneys provided over the past two years have gone mainly into the areas of problem prevention and intervention. We specifically asked the health boards, in last year's service plans, to outline their initiatives for intervention and problem prevention. We got a number of very worthwhile proposals and we have developed a number of best practice models of problem prevention and intervention in every health board area.</P>
      <P>As the correct balance between prevention and treating the problem is about 50:50, considerably more resources will have to be allocated to the prevention area. At present, there is a major drive right across the health boards &ndash; these initiatives are not only pilot projects &ndash; with a number of Departments involved with the Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, to put money into early intervention, family support and a range of initiatives to try to prevent problems rather than trying to cure them. I am satisfied we are moving in the right direction. The interagency response now adopted to this problem was not adopted in the past. Money is being provided for these areas and I look forward to further good news in the new few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment I was discussing the Fine Gael plan to 2011. We must try to reduce the damage done to health and life by excessive commuting by motor car. The World Health Organisation recently found that the long-term exposure of adults to car fumes caused more premature deaths per year from respiratory or heart ailments than car accidents. Studies have also found that diesel fuels do twice as much health damage per litre as leaded petrol and eight times as much as unleaded petrol.</P>
      <P>The number of road accidents in Ireland is of extreme concern. Some 500 people, mostly young adults, die on our roads each year. This is three times the Swedish rate of road accidents per 100,000 cars. The experience in Sweden shows that tough enforcement of anti-speeding and anti-drink driving laws can dramatically reduce road deaths. A recent survey, entitled &ldquo;Social Attitudes to Traffic Risk in Europe&rdquo;, showed that 80 per cent of Irish drivers believed they had zero chance of being caught if they broke the speed limit, whereas only 30 per cent of British drivers thought they had zero chance of being caught. This explains why half of all our road accidents are caused by speeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder our roads are overcrowded with cars when people are financially penalised for using public transport? In the past 15 years rail fares have increased by 31 per cent and bus fares by 59 per cent, whereas the cost of petrol used in cars has increased by only 16 per cent. Public transport has become more expensive while private transport has become cheaper. Because the Minister for Public Enterprise ref<Col N="1154" /> uses to recognise the social role of bus services, she is forcing Dublin Bus to increase fares by a further 10 per cent. That explains why we have traffic jams. We should set a national target for the next 20 years to ensure that bus and train fares are kept at half the rate of increase in the consumer price index and well below any increase in petrol and private motoring.</P>
    <P>Keeping bus and train fares low is also a key part of any programme to combat poverty and social exclusion. To do this, we must accept that bus fares should be subsidised. Urban bus services are heavily subsidised in most other developed countries. Dublin Bus receives only 3.38p in State subsidy per passenger journey, which is one of the lowest rates of subsidisation in the developed world. We should increase the rate of subsidy to Dublin Bus to 5p per passenger journey, provided certain conditions are met. CIE should adjust its fare structures to provide substantial financial incentives to encourage people to buy a single ticket for multiple journeys and to combine bus and train tickets.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions should be that blocks of bus routes, combining profit and loss making routes, should be franchised out to the private sector. The private sector should be systematically invited to provide services where Bus Éireann does not already do so. A good example is the new privately run bus routes in Naas which have been a great success. It should also be a condition that more late night services are provided in the city. A similar performance-related subsidy should be offered to Bus Éireann for services in cities, such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, and for inter-city services.</P>
    <P>Dublin urgently needs more taxis. Fine Gael believes the number of taxis in Dublin should be doubled over the next 12 months and increased by 50 per cent by next May before the tourist season begins. It is also essential that hackneys are allowed to use bus lanes since they will carry external identification from March 2000. The necessary regulations should be introduced at once to allow hackneys to use bus lanes from that date.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to provide proper housing is dramatic. Its much heralded temporary sewerage facilities have not been provided for 16,000 homes. An Bord Pleanála is still working at an extremely slow rate. The measures to increase housing density have not been implemented. Fine Gael believes the housing problem can only be solved in conjunction with a solution to the traffic problem. If we can provide efficient and fast public transport, we will be able to provide housing for everyone in places convenient to their work.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that those with low to medium incomes will need some form of State subsidisation or financial help if they are to house themselves. At present, a garda who is married to a nurse cannot afford to buy their first house in Dublin, yet they have above average incomes. Where will people whose incomes are below average be able to buy a house? The role of local <Col N="1155" /> authorities in the provision of social housing is crucial. In 1999 local authorities were provided with funds to build 4,500 local authority houses, but there were 46,000 families on local authority waiting lists. It will be ten years before existing applicants are provided with houses, not to mention the new applicants who will seek housing in the next ten years.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder low income families are faced with a major problem when looking for a house. In 1984 local authorities built 33 per cent of all houses built in the country, but they now build only 7.5 per cent of all houses built. The number of people on below average incomes has not declined, but income inequality has increased. Local authorities should, as a minimum, provide approximately 15 per cent of the total annual housing output per year.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject. One could spend days discussing either housing, planning or transportation.</P>
      <P>As a county councillor in County Donegal, I know that one of the most regular issues brought to my attention is planning. The number of planning applications from local people, returning emigrants or strangers wishing to build a family or holiday home has increased dramatically. It seems the drafting of the new county development plan in County Donegal has caused hysteria. This increase is a healthy sign and a vote of confidence in our region by those who wish to invest or to settle down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national debate County Clare has helped to generate mirrors many of the issues with which Donegal County Council is trying to grapple. It is difficult to strike a balance between encouraging people to invest in our beautiful county and maintaining the countryside and between trying to make our limited infrastructure cater for existing settlements and providing funding for new largescale developments. I hope the national development plan provides increased funding for infrastructure, such as water, sewerage and roads. It is also difficult to strike a balance between sustaining a vibrant countryside and becoming a seasonal holiday village for the rich from other parts of the island or for foreign urban dwellers who can avail of good exchange rates. The current exchange rate has created a great difficulty or opportunity, depending on whether one is a landowner or a local person trying to buy land for building. A difficult balance must be struck between enabling land owners to supplement their incomes from the poor fishing and farming that prevails in Donegal by selling off sites and keeping the price <Col N="1156" /> of house sites within the range of local people. One of the most difficult aspects of this question, as has been discovered in County Clare, is defining a local person. Given that the Inishowen electoral area now receives one third of all planning applications for Donegal, these balances are of great concern to everyone who lives in the peninsula, and rightly so. The work of finalising a county development plan must take each of these concerns into account. While I commend Donegal County Council on its high level of interaction with the community, I am sure the debate engendered in other counties will be helpful to our case.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Bill will make many improvements to the system. However, planning offices must be better resourced. It is important that decisions on applications be made speedily and that those who build without permission be challenged in an effective and efficient manner. It is also important that these ideals are not simply committed to paper but are resourced so that a speedy turnover of work can realistically occur.</P>
    <P>One of our greatest difficulties in County Donegal is the turnover of planning officials. The Inishowen region has been one of the hardest hit and we have had eight or ten planning officers in the past two years. This is largely because of the sheer volume of work. No region can develop a consistent planning policy or deliver an adequate service with regard to following up unauthorised development and so on, without a consistency of personnel. I trust that with new time limits will come new bodies.</P>
    <P>The national media debate gives the impression that our housing difficulties begin and end in Dublin. This is not so. House ownership remains an essential part of life for Irish people and in County Donegal, like everywhere else, we have good and bad records in realising that dream. Affordable housing and solutions for those looking to improve their lot are not yet present and possible existing solutions are fraught with difficulties. Those who have a site and are in a position to build must still acquire planning permission and this is becoming more and more complicated in our area, due to factors such as special areas of conservation, natural heritage areas and the issue of linear development. There has been an explosion of development in areas which had previously been quiet. For those willing to build but without a site, the problem is the escalating price of land. Our great advantages of a healthy environment and breathtaking scenery and our proximity to the large urban centre of Derry have become the greatest disadvantages to young couples wishing to build homes, because of the strong demand for holiday homes among people wishing to enjoy those very features. It is essential, given our difficulties in providing houses, that young people trying to set up home in their own locality should receive priority in terms of planning. In a time when our job creation level is poor and fishing and farming are becoming more challenging we should not add to <Col N="1157" /> the burdens of those who believe that the future can be brighter for our beautiful region.</P>
    <P>I mention the frustrations of those on county council lists of housing schemes although that may have to be resolved at a local level. For those on the specific instance list there is a long list of criteria which effectively exclude single people and couples without children. These categories of people are so low on the priority list that they never get a chance despite being in possession of a site. Where can a single person go? If a single person is lucky enough to be selected there follows months of paper shifting between various offices &ndash; environment, health, planning, roads, housing and so on &ndash; which must send reports over and back. The appropriate level of staffing is not available for the number of cases being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Once the local council offices become a reality in the new year these problems will be reduced and we all look forward to this. I congratulate the Donegal county manager and the county council for their initiative in moving to decentralise. They have led the way in this venture which has become a pilot for other counties. Decentralisation will bring services to the local communities and, in my area, will give a badly needed boost to the town of Carndonagh. While our county council meetings have followed the electoral area format for more than a year, the presence of the offices will make decentralisation a reality in the new millennium.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government visited my area on his first official visit as Minister and he saw that the council had begun to acquire the finance to develop new housing schemes. I live in a town where there had been a 16 year gap between the last scheme and the recommencement of house building and Deputies can imagine the length of the list of people waiting for new houses. I trust that the finance continues to arrive for new developments and that council spending will be able to match the finance it is given. I hope the Minister will continue to consider releasing land for council housing which is becoming more and more difficult. There is also a great need for serviced sites.</P>
    <P>In an ageing society, we should take a closer look at the granny flat concept and at supports offered to couples or elderly people to extend their homes to support other family members, thus taking them off the council housing list. I have many criticisms of the system of house repairs and extensions. I often come across situations where a small investment would leave a house in a much safer and healthier condition but where the applicant falls between existing schemes. Sometimes the investment needed to repair a house is prohibitive but the applicant does not want to leave it and the chance of qualifying for a specific instance house is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Central heating for the elderly presents another difficulty. I am unaware of any scheme which caters for it. Housing aid for the elderly is so underfunded that there is no scope to expand <Col N="1158" /> into heating, despite the fact that heat is one of the most basic needs of older people and one of the small comforts we can give to people who are often living alone and in need of such small comforts. While I praise the way the North Western Health Board gets value for money for its scheme, I feel the money it offers applicants does not meet their needs and there is a serious countrywide backlog for a scheme which is intended to supply basic urgent repairs.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Action Inishowen, an organisation in my region, for its energy action programme which brought trainees into the homes of the elderly and insulated roofs, placed spy-holes and safety chains on doors and provided many other small but important improvements. I hope this organisation will be supported by the various agencies in running a second phase of the scheme and I hope the range of improvements they provide will be increased. Old people need to feel safe, snug and secure in their homes and this scheme has helped to see that they do so. The scheme is to be reviewed with a view to rationalising it and including areas currently unsupported. I ask the Minister to outline the current status of the review and its recommendations, if any.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the Environment and Local Government for the work being done under the guise of voluntary housing. This is true value in partnership. In my area I have watched various voluntary groups spend months pursuing dreams of housing schemes for those who need them most. The quality of the developments are second to none and are not, in any sense, ghettos or second-class options. I trust the support given to these groups will continue and, while accepting the need for a certain amount of bureaucracy, I hope the level of red tape will be kept to a minimum. I could speak about the need to improve the new house grant but that question has been debated long and hard many times. I hope it can be incorporated into a mortgage, given as a mortgage relief and improved significantly. It could be a kick start for many young people in taking on a financial commitment which they otherwise could not take on.</P>
    <P>With regard to transport in north Donegal, I cannot argue about whether the train fare to Cork is cheaper than that to Limerick. This does not mean anything to me because we, in north Donegal, do not have a train service. I cannot argue about the air service from Dublin to Shannon, Kerry, Cork, Galway, Belfast or Derry because Donegal does not have an air service. The transport issue is vitally important to north Donegal. On a regular basis I am told that the tourism and business sectors suffer due to the peripheral and inaccessible nature of Donegal. Indeed, those of us who commute to work have our own thoughts on those two words. However, in a time of high unemployment and a lack of opportunities, this statement gains even more significance. The words &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; and &ldquo;inaccessible&rdquo; are taken as the excuse for businesses not <Col N="1159" /> wanting to invest or locate in the region. To me, this is the easy option. It is a real opt-out clause. People in north Donegal in so many ways feel far from peripheral. They have worked for large companies, which have operated successfully for a number of years and which have been happy with the adjacent urban centre of Derry, the proximity of the port of Larne and the international airport in Antrim. Indeed, the Government provided support for the development of Derry City Airport, which was needed to enable a major airline to land large planes at this regional airport. This support has been important and it had a positive effect, which perhaps will take a little more time to appreciate, yet when I ask what role this has had for job creation, I find myself asking, &ldquo;Are our agencies using this service to get business people into the north-west or are they returning to the old, more comfortable argument that until we have a Dublin-Derry service we will not really feel the benefit of a foreign itinerary coming into our region?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In raising this issue I am aware it is outside the remit of the Minister's Department. However, the State agency which is responsible for job creation cites access as a major drawback. Therefore, in the context of transport, I ask what can be done to link Donegal to Dublin in the context of road, rail and air services?</P>
    <P>We already have an airport in Derry which can accommodate planes of any size. There are regional airports all over the country which provide a social and economic service, often without making a profit. This ensures that most locations on this small island are only a short distance apart. Why, therefore, are we, in north Donegal, treated differently? Surely a person from Malin should have the same right of access to public transport as someone from Cork. That inequity is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There is already a rail link from Derry to Belfast and from Belfast to Dublin, but there is no direct service linking north Donegal with Dublin. Whether this is seen as an improvement of the existing line, a Donegal-Sligo-Dublin or a Letterkenny-Derry-Dublin service, there can be no argument regarding funding as it comes back to the same issue of the right of a Donegal person to the same entitlements as any other citizen of the Republic.</P>
    <P>One person who is contributing to transport infrastructure in Donegal is the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, who is providing funding towards piers and harbours. He is providing for real change and making a positive impact on my county. There are opportunities opening up for car ferry links and everything seems to revolve around that particular transport sector.</P>
    <P>To return to an aspect over which there is greater control, I raise the issue of the development of a corridor from north Donegal through Derry to Dublin. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and Lord Dubbs co-launched the north-west <Col N="1160" /> region cross-Border group transportation infrastructural study which, along with the Donegal task force initiative report of not that long ago, showed the consensus that exists in regard to what needs to be done. I need do no more than remind any Minister who has come up through Omagh of the joys of travelling on that route, the A5-N2. While many people do not seem to realise it, there are large urban centres to be served in the north-west and, just like the argument for the rail and air services, there is no excuse for any Government to ignore the infrastructural needs of a transport network.</P>
    <P>For all the talk of an inability to achieve consensus on any matter relating to the North, this is not the case in relation to transport infrastructure as it pertains to us in the real north. We in the north-west, irrespective of political and social divides, never again want to hear the phrase &ldquo;the poor relation&rdquo; because this is what we feel like at present. We never want to see a map which shows red, black, yellow or green lines serving three quarters of the island, with a great void of white with no lines in the north-west. I trust that major and significant improvements will result from the national development plan and I await its publication.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, each of the topics under consideration today would merit a single debate in its own right and it is difficult to be all-embracing and to give adequate justice to planning, housing or transport in the time permitted, but there will be other opportunities to do so. I wish all the relevant Ministers well in the large range of important aspects which come under the remit of their Departments and congratulate them on the many initiatives and changes which they are bringing to their briefs.</P>

      <P>The development of a number of towns into major residential centres is proposed in Fine Gael's rival national plan, the policy document entitled A Plan for the Nation. It is a vision of Ireland up to 2010 and it proposes changes in the key areas of housing, transport, child care, taxation and the environment. One of the main planks of this excellent document is the drawing up of a national residential plan to encourage growth in a number of towns outside Dublin, including Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar, Athlone, Tralee, Kilkenny, Portlaoise and Dundalk. This would be achieved through the expansion of the national rail network to encourage the location of businesses and housing developments throughout the State to slow down the expansion of Dublin. This is a huge opportunity. The infrastructural investment would be vast but it should be looked at seriously. The expansion outlined in the Fine Gael document would be financed by the issuing of 30 year fixed rate housing bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> Government services and entire Departments should be decentralised to encourage people to spread the economic boom, which is so evident in the State, to other growth centres. The ESRI medium-term review to 2003 noted that the high and rising costs of accommodation will translate into higher labour costs and certainly will put huge pressure on employers. The cost and availability of housing is restricting the labour market and impacting on mobility and wage inflation. There can be little doubt that the planning authorities must move towards increased density development, which will require better and more creative designs and higher standards. In addition, more land should be zoned for residential development, in particular along or adjacent to major transport routes. We must look seriously at this area. The lack of supply has the potential to add to the skill shortages and undermine attitudes to pay and social agreement. The problem must be addressed by action on planning infrastructure. There is also a strong case for strengthening the position of first-time buyers in the housing market.</P>
    <P>There is a need for radical streamlining of the planning process to make it more efficient and capable of dealing with such issues as consultation, public inquiry and EIS statements as early as possible in the life of a project. This would be very helpful in that a great deal of time can be lost in this way. Additional resources should be allocated to ensure that current planning bottlenecks are cleared. Careful consideration should be given to specific actions such as pre-planning processes, a fast-tracking mechanism for key projects which are behind schedule and a review of current systems of compensation. Subject to the appropriate democratic safeguards, the introduction of a ministerial or public utility decree could cut through some of the tangles of red tape.</P>
    <P>If the right decisions are made now, there is a unique opportunity for the economy, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, housing and child care. Those are the important areas of development in the coming years. If the right decisions are made now, they will have a major impact up to 2010.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on bringing forward the rural renewal plan because if the level of applications for planning permission is an indication of a county's economic health, then Leitrim is booming. The number of applications that has resulted from the announcement of the plan is startling and the building boom in County Leitrim is one of the first indications of the dramatic effect of the recently introduced rural tax scheme. This scheme will create huge economic activity in Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, only 35 DEDs were allocated to County Sligo and the Minister should reconsider the position in that. In the past, tax designation was concentrated on large urban centres and towns but rural areas, small towns and villages will now have the opportunity to develop. The first sign of the success of this scheme is clearly <Col N="1162" /> evident in Leitrim and it is obvious that it is also having a major impact in the 35 areas in Sligo to which I referred. The scheme is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>At present, an inquiry is ongoing regarding the construction of an inner relief road in through Sligo. I appeal to the Minister to decide in favour of this project. A sworn public inquiry has taken place but the Minister has not given his final decision. This project has been in existence for 25 years and the proposed route will run south of Sligo town from the end of the Collooney dual carriageway to Hughes Bridge. The bridge was opened in 1989 when the corporation had already begun purchasing land along the proposed route. This issue has bitterly divided Sligo, with objectors describing it as an undesirable development. However, the county manager has stated that the proposed inner relief road offers the best solution to Sligo's traffic problems. John Fleming of the National Roads Authority has stated that &ldquo;Sligo is a destination town in its own right,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Only 15 per cent is through-traffic bypass .&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If Sligo is to develop as a town of regional importance and as a place where people will be happy to live, a proper transport network must be provided. This matter has been under discussion for too long. The proposed western bypass route would also be a welcome development, but if we were to change our preference at this point it would take another 20 years for the new road to be built. The chamber of commerce also supports the construction of the inner relief road. The development of any new road always attracts controversy, with people either favouring or opposing its construction, but in my opinion the majority of people in Sligo welcome the proposed inner relief road because it could prove of great benefit to the county. I hope the Minister will make a ministerial order in respect of the project. I know the objectors can take their case to Europe but we must take a stand in respect of this important development which will have a great effect on Sligo's future growth.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the week, I raised on the Adjournment the prospect of Sligo being officially declared a city. The town has a cathedral and is a seat of local government and I appeal to the Minister to give favourable consideration to this suggestion. His Department has at its disposal the ways and means to grant city status to Sligo. I understand the town can declare itself a city for historical or other reasons but the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; has a major meaning in that it gives the correct signals to those intent on investing in a given area. Officials of Sligo Corporation sometimes become confused between referring to it as a town or a city.</P>
    <P>If Sligo and other towns are to develop as future growth centres, I suggest that the Government should not concentrate on building new town centres. Sligo, with its a local authority and cathedral, has the structures in place to be declared a city. If it is to develop as a centre of population with more than 50,000 inhabitants, the <Col N="1163" /> Government must give the right signals that it will be one of the proposed development centres to receive State support.</P>
    <P>Opportunities for infrastructural development are extremely important. Fine Gael has produced an excellent document in this area which offers a vision of Ireland for the year 2010. Ten years is a short period and we must develop a plan to put in place badly needed structures. Gridlock in the planning system is threatening enterprise, development and investment. This has serious implications for our competitive position.</P>
    <P>The planning system has become part of the infrastructural logjam in a variety of areas, including roads, public transport, waste disposal, sewerage and water supplies. For example, the maximum time taken to secure planning permission for a priority road project in the EU is three years. In Ireland, it can take more than six years. In the case of Sligo's inner relief road, it has taken 20 years.</P>
    <P>The balance has swung away from action and implementation towards inordinate deliberation and consultation. In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of appeals to An Bord Pleanála &ndash; more than 35 per cent between 1995 and 1997. In the same period, the number of cases which were determined within four months &ndash; the period stipulated in the regulations for determining appeals &ndash; slipped from 98 per cent in 1995 to 82 per cent in 1997.</P>
    <P>I recognise the right of third parties to lodge objections to proposed industrial and other developments. There is no reason an efficient consultation and appeals process, on one hand, and an open and democratic planning system, on the other, should be mutually exclusive. We must reconsider the planning guidelines. I again welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter and I appeal to the Minister of State to forward my request for a decision on the N4 inner relief road to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Perry for sharing his time. Housing is the first item on every public representative's clinic sheet at present. Family after family visits our clinics to see if we can wave a magic wand and create a house for them. Sadly this cannot be done, but there must be a major drive by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities to tackle this problem. First, the Department must ensure that all local authorities are using their housing allocation. A number of the authorities are a year or two years behind in this matter. The Department must make the necessary facilities available to these authorities to ensure that there is not a backlog in respect of such allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the problems to which people refer in this area relate to the lack of architects, engineers, etc., to allow local authorities design, plan and have housing schemes erected. Land continues to be a major factor. Local authorities to <Col N="1164" /> not have land banks available to them to meet their needs. For example, with a housing list of more than 700 families, Kildare County Council has not had land readily available to it in the Newbridge area to tackle such a major problem.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to provide for the travelling community, proper halting and transient sites across the country. These people are not being cared for and many local authorities have done nothing to alleviate their problems. Urgent action is also required in respect of the housing lists operated by the relevant local authorities. Many of these are outdated and misleading and they must be updated.</P>
    <P>Since I came to this House, and during my time in the Seanad, I have sought to ensure that 100 per cent funding is provided in respect of the disabled persons' grant. Disappointingly, this has not happened but I accept that successive Governments have improved the percentage paid by the Department. However, this is not good enough. We are faced with a situation where disabled people &ndash; who, in many cases, are senior citizens &ndash; are suffering because they do not have adequate funds to ensure that work on their houses is completed. In many instances, people will not return their application forms because of their financial position. During this age of plenty, can we tolerate the existence of such a sad situation? People are suffering because, in many cases, they do not have the small sum of money required to meet their needs. I ask the Government to take immediate action in respect of this grant and provide 100 per cent funding.</P>
    <P>With regard to the transport problems that affect my constituency and the people who live there, I ask that the following be investigated, namely, the extension of the Arrow service to Athy and Carlow and the completion of the additional lane on the N7 from Rathcoole to Naas. These items are essential to permit the south Kildare area to develop in line with adjacent catchment areas of the capital. At present, a trip from Athy to Dublin takes between one and a half and one and three quarter hours. The N7 is a nightmare to travel on, morning or evening. The number of vehicles using this motorway has increased dramatically in the past two years. It is imperative that an extra lane is provided which would free a lane for heavy vehicles and allow a greater flow of vehicles on the motorway, thus reducing journey time to and from the capital.</P>
    <P>The extension of the Arrow service to Carlow and Athy is very important. If that service was provided, it would immediately have an effect on the traffic problems on the N7 and N9 and would be of huge benefit to the south Kildare area, an area with a high rate of unemployment. Kildare has seen major industrial and residential development, but it has mostly been in the northern part of the county. Thus the importance of providing proper infrastructure to assist the development of the south Kildare area.</P>
    <P>Other essential projects which must be completed to ensure such an infrastructure are the <Col N="1165" /> Kildare-Monasterevin bypass, the Crookstown-Moone-Timolin alignment and the Castledermot bypass. The final part of the jigsaw is the proposed inner relief street in Athy. Deputy Ellis could have been talking about Athy when he spoke of waiting 25 years. There are exactly the same problems in Sligo as there are in Athy, and they must be resolved as a matter of urgency to ensure the development of this once great market town.</P>
    <P>These four infrastructural changes are included in the Kildare county development plan and the Athy UDC development plan. The Kildare area is the next area due for development within the county. I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to use all his powers to ensure an early solution to the Kildare bypass problem. This major traffic problem has a huge effect on the county with cars and heavy vehicles now using country roads in their attempts to create their own bypasses, thus creating major problems in these areas.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem with the bus service within the county. Kildare has some of the major motorways but a pensioner in a rural area cannot get to the local town. Last week I met a pensioner who stated that because of these problems, she could only go to town once a week when a neighbour was driving there. We must look for transport facilities within the county which will provide such people with an outlet. A free travel pass is no use to a person who lives 12 miles from the nearest bus route. Travel arrangements, private or otherwise, must be looked at to ensure that pensioners can get to town to shop and collect their pensions.</P>
    <P>Planning is a major concern for rural Deputies. Every Deputy in this House wants rural life to survive but too many planning authorities now see the city, town or village as the only place for a person to set up home, without giving consideration to the financial hardship that imposes. I have heard of many cases of people from a rural background being pressurised into moving to a town, thus putting another name on the housing list of that local authority. People with a rural background must be given a chance to retain that background and not be forced to go to the nearest town before they are granted planning permission. The cost of urban housing causes financial hardship for them. It would be possible for those people to get a low cost site if they could get planning permission in their own area, thereby relieving much of the financial strain.</P>
    <P>I hope the items mentioned will be brought to the attention of the relevant Ministers and that south Kildare will be able to match the north of the county in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues of housing, planning and transport are inter-linked, as those of us based in Dublin are aware. It is opportune, however, that we are discussing this today when the Book of Estimates has just been published <Col N="1166" /> and the new national development plan will soon be unveiled.</P>
      <P>I was heartened to note in the Estimates that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is being allocated an additional £239 million from the Exchequer, of which £174 million will be spent on the local authority social housing programme. Exchequer spending on the roads programme will increase by £40 million. That provision will be supplemented by expenditure from the local government fund and other sources, giving a total spend on roads of £622 million. There will be an increase in the funding of water and sewage projects, an essential part of provision of land for housing, to £413 million, and an increase in spending on local authority social and affordable housing, raising the total to £714 million. The expenditure on housing will provide 8,500 accommodation units next year, of which 5,500 will be local authority housing starts. I hope local authorities which have been given an allocation of housing starts will use the allocation as quickly as possible. The Department of Public Enterprise has been allocated an additional £100 million for continued investment in public transport.</P>
      <P>Housing issues have exercised those of us in the Dublin area for some time. I compliment the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland and the Planning Institute for organising a conference on stopping the sprawl. Deputy Gilmore was the only Deputy who attended. Issues germane to the debate, such as design and density, were addressed by eminent speakers. I compliment the Government on its continuing commitment to address housing issues in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The most significant regeneration programme in the history of the State has been undertaken in my constituency in Ballymun. Ballymun will become an example of what can be done. I am aware of the mistakes of the past, when housing was provided with no other facilities or infrastructure. I was delighted to see the outcome of the architectural competition run by Ballymun Regeneration Limited. It was won by a consortium of architects from Glasgow, a city where the very best in design and density exists. These issues have been addressed in Ballymun and will bring to bear the need for an improved social mix and to give people the opportunity to live in apartment, standard or duplex housing. The provision of student accommodation and executive apartments was also included in the winning entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Density and design are issues which must be addressed. When one looks at areas such as Drumcondra and Phibsboro, built years ago, one sees a very high level of density but no one could say there is a poor quality of housing. It is possible to have good quality housing design with a high level of density. We should do our best to increase density within the M50 ring because it contains the best infrastructural support. There is potential for transport links, such as the Pelletstown site on the Navan Road which was part <Col N="1167" /> of the Dublin Corporation's development plan last year. An area plan is being developed for that in consultation with the local community and developers. That it is on a rail link provides potential for high quality, well designed urban neighbourhoods close to the city and the rail line might be linked to Dublin Airport and Navan. It will afford an opportunity to those who wish to return to the city.</P>
    <P>Social housing has been addressed through the affordable housing initiative. The public should be aware that affordable housing does not mean cheap, low quality housing. I commend Dublin Corporation for its efforts in the Ratoath Road area where it will carry some of the cost of the sites and, at the same time, provide 60 to 70 good quality new homes for young people who will be able to avail of them through the shared ownership scheme or the affordable housing initiative.</P>
    <P>Certain elements of the transport problem had been dealt with properly but we should not put all our eggs in one basket. An interlinked system is needed and I am delighted the Government has given a commitment to address Luas and other aspects of the transport system. There is an urgent need for a rail link to the airport. Those of us who reside on the north side of Dublin cannot wait for that. One wants to travel to and from the airport as quickly as possible. I am very much of favour of its construction as it would address transport needs for students in DCU, people travelling to and from the airport and those who reside in Ballymun.</P>
    <P>A perennial issue is the shortage of taxis and I have heard many simplistic solutions to the problem. Dublin Corporation and the other local authorities are trying to do their best to address it but when one considers that the full allocation of taxi plates this year has still not been made six weeks before Christmas, it is not possible, even with the best will in the world, to allocate endless taxi plates at the wave of a hand and more thought needs to be put in. Dublin Bus, in which I am losing a great deal of faith, needs to be encouraged to provide a more diverse form of transport. Dubliners are sick and tired of being told that the company cannot provide late night transport. Buses must stop running at 11.30 p.m. during the week and are provided for an extra few hours at the weekend. Late night bus services ought to be available every night. Orbital bus routes should be introduced. Many people do not want to go into the city centre all the time to carry on business. They want to visit friends and travel to shopping centres and workplaces on the periphery of the city and such bus routes would alleviate much of the transport problem.</P>
    <P>There will be a detailed discussion on planning later but a mechanism is needed whereby infrastructural projects, such as the Dublin Port tunnel, the north fringe sewer and the C ring do not get held up interminably. I welcome the allocation of £30 million for the north fringe sewer and that will release a great deal of land on the north side <Col N="1168" /> of the city. If there is an integrated approach to these developments, progress can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter. There is only six weeks left before Christmas and there is nothing surprising about the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's failure to provide a commitment to the people on the whole-time job initiative scheme. It is causing great distress among the 2,875 workers on the scheme and, in particular, the 1,000 participants whose contracts expire at the end of the year. They are rightly concerned that in the early days of the new millennium they will be in danger of returning to the same dole office they left three years ago when they took up employment under the scheme. At least back then most of these workers did not have expectations about how employment could impact on the quality of their lives but now that they have, work means something to them and the uncertainty of their future is hugely distressing.</P>
      <P>I am extremely puzzled at the handling of this programme by the Minister. I have serious doubts about bringing in conventional consultants, such as Deloitte &amp; Touche, to assess the efficacy of such a scheme. Such consultants do not know very much about such a programme and the diversity of jobs, tasks and projects that participants undertake. I have been pressing the Minister since last March to make clear how she intends to use the scheme in future. It is the middle of November and I still have not received a response. I was advised, for example, in response to a recent parliamentary question that she would make a decision on the jobs initiative scheme in consultation with the relevant social partners. Yesterday the Labour Party was informed by her on the Order of Business that such a decision would be made next week. However, as I understand it, she has not been in contact with them.</P>
      <P>The jobs initiative scheme, similar to community employment, has not just impacted positively on the lives of the long-term unemployed. The benefits which accrued to local communities is also evident and for this reason the Minister can ill afford to further procrastinate on the future of this programme. The scheme was put in place three years ago and focused on the long-term unemployed. Eligibility requirements included that the participants should be over 35 years of age and unemployed for five years or more. The scheme guaranteed three years employment at the going rate for the job with different sponsors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> The scheme has been a considerable success and I do not say that because of my involvement in setting it up. It brought back into the workforce a category of people who had been unemployed for so long that most despaired of obtaining work again. I do not claim that the scheme is perfect but it has done wonders for the self-confidence of almost 2,900 people and their hopes for the future. I was disappointed that the training component of the scheme is not uniform and has not always been structured as rigorously as it might be. I also hoped for a higher level of placement in permanent employment but, ironically, that is partially due to the fact that many participants enjoy the jobs they are doing. In other cases, sponsors have not thought out sufficiently a role for participants.</P>
    <P>However, the biggest question mark hangs over what the Government is planning for these people when these valuable schemes finish. Instead of considering altering and terminating parts of the programme it is crucial that the Government invests further in it making it more relevant to the needs of the participants and the communities they serve. I have pressed the Minister since last March to be clear about this because there are different categories of work involved, some of which are capable of transfer to the social economy unit which she has planned. I ask her to put people's minds at rest about this as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this issue. Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants were commissioned by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in April 1999 to undertake a review of the effectiveness of the job initiative programme against its objectives on reaching the end of the first phase of its operations on 31 December 1999. The objectives of the job initiative programme, which was launched as a pilot initiative by the Government in 1996, are to provide assistance in the form of an active labour market intervention to the long-term unemployed for whom access to work is extremely limited and to make a significant contribution to local development in confined urban areas with weak local labour markets. The programme is specifically aimed at people who are over 35 years and registered as unemployed or on lone parent's allowance for more than five years.</P>
      <P>The programme was originally confined to six urban partnership areas in the cities of Cork, Limerick and Dublin and it was extended to all 38 partnership areas in 1998. The total number of persons qualifying for the programme is approximately 13,500 and a total of 2,875 places were allocated to the programme in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants' report was furnished recently to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and following examination by her Department, the Tánaiste requested that it be published and made available to the social partners for their examination. This is likely to take <Col N="1170" /> place tomorrow. The consultants' conclusions on the operation of the job initiative programme are generally supportive. However, they have made a number of recommendations on how the operation of the programme might be improved and made more effective. They recommend that participants from phase 1 of the programme, who are due to complete their three year term on 31 December 1999, should receive a six months extension.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste accepts that this recommendation is necessary to enable these participants to engage more actively in seeking alternative employment opportunities in the open labour market than they may have had heretofore and in order to remove uncertainty for these participants and their managing agents, particularly at this time of the year.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations contained in the report, of which there are a substantial number, will be the subject of consultations with the social partners over the coming weeks, as previously indicated by the Tánaiste. At the end of this consultations phase the Tánaiste intends to make final decisions on the operation of the programme.</P>
    <P>The evaluation by the consultants' report was carried out under the following terms of reference: comment-analysis on whether the programme remains an appropriate programme having regard to current state of the labour market and likely future trends; a review of the assumptions underlying the targeted groups; whether the programme is successful in meeting its objectives and suggestions as to how it might be improved or better targeted; and an assessment of whether the programme provides value for money to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The consultants' conclusions and recommendations with regard to the terms of reference take into account consultations with all the relevant organisations associated with the programme, including FÁS, as the operational agency for the programme, area partnerships, managing agents and project groups, trainers and other interested groups. These consultations have enabled the consultants to establish qualitative and attitudinal information on all the main aspects of the programme and to identify the key issues for examination.</P>
    <P>I am confident the report and the outcome of the consultations with the social partners over the coming weeks will provide a firm basis for sound decisions on the future operation of the job initiative programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permission to raise this important matter of <Col N="1171" /> whether, in view of public concern about safety on the railways, the Minister for Public Enterprise will order an inquiry into the circumstances in which, because of the crush at Tara Street on Monday, 8 November, between 5 p.m. and 6.10 p.m., a blind person was pushed over the edge of the platform and had to be rescued by fellow travellers and his guide dog was shoved off the platform onto the tracks between two carriages.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned about safety on our trains for some time. On 3 November I asked a parliamentary question on the measures being taken to improve safety on the Clonsilla-Connolly railway line in view of fears expressed by a large number of my constituents. In her reply the Minister informed me that the safety of railway operations rested with Iarnród Éireann and that &ldquo;accordingly it is a matter for Iarnród Éireann to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried on any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety&rdquo;. The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>There are no safety standards in place in relation to overcrowding of trains either in this country or at EU level. However, my Department's railway inspecting officer has been in contact again recently with Iarnród Éireann drawing their attention to the importance of keeping this matter under review.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply surprised me. I have travelled on the Clonsilla-Connolly train and experienced the gross overcrowding at peak periods. Passengers are crushed together like the proverbial sardines and stand between carriages with nothing to hold onto. In the event of a sudden stop, for whatever reason, there could be a serious injury. If an accident occurred, as happened in London recently where a fire broke out, the consequences could be very serious.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, safety standards should be laid down in relation to overcrowding. I note from the reply to my parliamentary question, which stated that rail safety was a matter for Iarnród Éireann, that the Minister was sufficiently concerned to arrange for her railway inspecting officer to talk to Iarnród Éireann. I find, as a result of a report I received yesterday and an article in today's issue of <i>The Examiner,</i> that we should be concerned not only about overcrowding on trains but on the platforms.</P>
      <P>On the day in question at Tara Street station a blind man, his blind wife and his guide dog were on the platform awaiting the 5.31 p.m. train to Balbriggan. The train was delayed and did not arrive until 6.10 p.m., by which time the platform was packed with commuters. Mr. Tom O'Neill, the person to whom I have referred, describes what happened then. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was like a football crush because three scheduled trains were late and everyone pushed to board the one train. I was towards the front and my dog got pushed onto the <Col N="1172" /> tracks between two carriages. I left the platform too but ended up hanging by the side of one of the carriages.</P>
    <P>Fellow passengers managed to pull Tom O'Neill back and a number of others climbed down to the tracks to rescue his guide dog.</P>
    <P>Being caught in a rush can be a terrifying experience for any of us but for a blind person the experience is traumatic. Tom O'Neill is of the opinion that his experience underlines the necessity for a member of Iarnród Éireann staff to be on the platform to control crowds and to ensure people, particularly the disabled, can board trains safely. I agree with him. The terrifying ordeal which Tom O'Neill experienced should concentrate our minds on rail safety generally and the problems for incapacitated persons in particular. Crowd control and supervision is essential. Waiting would-be commuters must be kept informed of what is happening. Too often the public address system is not sufficiently utilised and in some stations is non-existent. Regulations must be introduced and enforced to control the number of passengers on trains and the efficiency of the railway system must be improved.</P>
    <P>I do not know the reason for the delays on that Monday evening which resulted in a large build-up of frustrated would-be passengers on the platform. What happened was predictable in the circumstances. I made the point on another occasion in relation to the Clonsilla-Connolly line that if there were more trains there would be less overcrowding. If a would-be passenger for Clonsilla or Castleknock knows that if he or she does not get on board the 5.52 p.m. train they will have to wait three hours and eight minutes for the next train, they will make a determined effort to board the train irrespective of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>I hope the terrifying ordeal experienced by Tom O'Neill, his wife and guide dog will concentrate the minds of those in the Department and in Iarnród Éireann who have not given as much attention and focus to this problem as they should. If they do so now it will give some consolation and satisfaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputies Currie and Sargent on raising this matter. I share their concerns about what happened to this man and his dog. While the person involved was not injured, I am sure he got quite a shock from the ordeal. I wish him the very best and hope he has now fully recovered from the experience.</P>
      <P>The incident was reported to one of my Department's railway inspecting officers by Iarnród Éireann. I understand the background to it was that on the evening in question northbound trains from the city centre were running late due to the failure of a DART train at Howth Junction. This led to a larger than usual group of passengers gathered on the platforms of Tara Street Station.</P>
      <P>It appears that a blind man and his guide dog were among the group waiting at the station for the 17.28 Pearse Station to Drogheda train. Due to the earlier DART failure this train arrived approximately 40 minutes late by which time the platform was crowded. While attempting to board the train it appears that this man and his dog were pushed by the crowd to the gap between the train and the platform but was pulled back by passengers and did not fall to the track. His dog however fell between the train and the platform but was also rescued by some of those present. While neither suffered physical injury both were traumatised by the event.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that crowd numbers on the platforms at Tara Street Station are monitored by a closed circuit television unit at the entrance point. Staff are instructed to ensure when the numbers become too great passengers are not allowed up to the platforms until the numbers reduce. My Department's railway inspectorate has already been in contact with Iarnród Éireann regarding this incident and will follow up on all relevant matters.</P>
      <P>Safety on the railway is one of my Department's major concerns. The House will recall that the Government has approved the implementation of the Iarnród Éireann safety investment programme, 1999 to 2003, which will cost £430 million. The programme has already commenced and some £80 million will be spent on rail safety this year with £100 million to be spent next year. It covers improvements to track, signalling, level crossings, bridges, fencing and railway stations. More importantly, it also covers the management of railway safety and rail safety culture. Incidents like this serve to emphasise the importance of safe management systems in the operation of a railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the safety investment programme is implemented we will, I hope, begin to see the fruits of the investment coming through in improved <Col N="1174" /> railway safety. What we cannot lose sight of however is the fact that no matter how good the equipment used on railways or how vigilant are those who work on and manage the railway, accidents will happen and ultimately rail safety cannot be guaranteed. What is incumbent on all of us is to ensure such accidents are minimised as much as possible. We all have a responsibility. All the safety regulations in the world will have no effect if passengers do not exert proper caution and due care for themselves and other passengers when boarding or while travelling on trains.</P>
    <P>In this instance it appears that the jostling and pushing of the crowds waiting to board the train were major factors in causing the man concerned to lose his footing. The situation could have been far more serious. I remind all passengers who use the railway that while rail is a very safe mode of travel, such safety is dependent on all of us behaving in a safe manner when travelling on trains.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming national development plan will, among other things, make provision for investment for the upgrading and improvement of railway stations. I expect Tara Street Station to be a prime candidate for such investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for coming in to the House to reply to this short debate on what is a horrendous problem. As both he and the Garda Síochána are well aware, large areas of the northside, westside and southside of the city continue to be terrorised by joyriders with six cars or more involved on occasion. Day and night for the past three months there has been mayhem, particularly on the northside. Children have been knocked down and there is a fear that the long list of deaths will be added to. About two and a half months ago as the House reassembled there was the tragic slaughter of a leading northside community activist and leader, Mr. Richie Green, who served the people of Donnycarney, Coolock and Artane for many years on many projects, especially unemployment action groups. Both he and his young daughter were slaughtered by joyriders early one morning in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through the good offices of the assistant commissioner, Mr. McHugh, my local superintendant, Mr. Flynn, and inspector Seamus Kane, an anti-joyriding task force has been established in the past eight or nine months. It drew up an action programme at its most recent meeting. What we are looking for is a dedicated youth centre in Priorswood parish, the provision of the necessary additional funds for the Darndale-Belcamp village centre to include youth facilities as well as the necessary support for youth programmes in <Col N="1175" /> Priorswood, Darndale, Belcamp, Bonnybrook and Kilbarrack parishes covering such matters as genuine car sport and car maintenance for the tiny minority who have been drawn into this criminal activity. Community activists, public representatives and the Garda Síochána are also seeking resources for additional education services, particularly at primary level. The total amount required is of the order of £3.5 million. I urge the Minister to ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to provide this sum for the parishes concerned in the budget to be announced on 1 December.</P>
    <P>I do not want to raise the death of a child or other person in the areas mentioned on the Order of Business in the next few weeks. To this end there is a need for a dedicated anti-joyriding Garda unit which would operate between Tallaght and north Coolock. There is also a need for legislation. I have produced the heads of a car theft (anti-joyriding) Bill. In opposition the Minister had a good reputation for introducing Bills in the House. I have brought forward a few of my own. If the Minister was prepared to make Government time available I would be prepared to bring forward my Bill to criminalise the activities of unscrupulous dealers who sell so-called company cars to young boys and girls.</P>
    <P>There is a need to provide more places for the young criminals concerned in their mid to late teens, one of whom caused mayhem in my area for about six weeks, upsetting thousands of people. The Children Bill has been brought forward at long last. It was needed a year ago.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to visit us in my own ward; I am a city councillor in the Donaghmede area, or to invite the joyriding task force to meet him so that a programme of measures can be put in place to try to end this horrendous problem once and for all. The last time we had a meeting, one of the people in the room was Richard Greene, who along with his beautiful young daughter was slaughtered recently by these criminals. That man gave great service to the north side of Dublin. This is an outrageous situation and we must bring it to an end. It is the Minister's responsibility and I urge him to do that in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of resources the Government has made available to youth facilities and services in Dublin north east is clear proof of its determination to tackle the root causes of social deprivation and youth offending in the area. As the House will appreciate, these funds are channelled through a number of Government Departments, including my own. I will therefore first describe the initiatives undertaken by my colleagues, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, and the Minister for Education and Science, before outlining resources and activities in my own area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, in the period 1999 to 2001 the Exchequer will contribute £34.8 mill<Col N="1176" /> ion towards the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund set up in 1998 by the Government. In addition, the corporate sector will make a significant contribution to the fund. This fund develops youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas. In April 1999, the Government allocated more than £25 million of the total amount to support 295 facilities and services projects in 13 local drugs task force areas. More than 60 youth workers, Outreach and sport workers are employed providing a wide variety of developmental activities and educational programmes for young people at risk in these task areas.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin north east task force area, where 27 projects are under way, funding amounting to £1,735,000 has been approved in principle for a range of facilities, services and grants. More than £800,000 has been earmarked for the construction and renovation of local youth and community facilities. Ten youth workers will be employed on seven service projects. Just over £100,000 has been set aside to support locally-based sport and youth groups with equipment and basic programme costs to provide activities and programmes for the target group of persons at risk. Grants of more than £40,000 have been approved towards the cost of equipment for local youth clubs, sports clubs and women's groups.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science provides further resources to youth services in the north east Dublin area. The Department provides financial assistance through the City of Dublin Youth Service Board for projects such as Ballymun Youth Action, Ballymun Youth Provision, Bonnybrook Youth Project, Donnycarney Youth Project and the Priorswood Youth Service. In addition, the City of Dublin Youth Service Board receives an annual grant of £647,444 to operate a local youth grant scheme in their region and a further £26,555 per annum towards the costs of Foroige's north Dublin youth development officer.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda are represented at the monthly meetings of the local task force on joyriding by an inspector and a sergeant. The community police sergeant is in continuous contact with local residents groups in the areas, and as a result of consultations with Dublin Corporation, plinth walls and barriers have been erected in Moatview Court to prevent stolen cars being driven into the estate.</P>
    <P>A policing strategy is in place from both the prevention and enforcement aspects, and this has yielded results. Operation Steering Wheel has been devised and put in place to counter these incidents and involves targeted patrolling by a dedicated unit in the affected areas. These issues are under constant review by local Garda management. Responses and strategies will continue to be put in place, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to point out that since coming into office, I have given a high priority to the diversion of young people who are at risk of <Col N="1177" /> becoming involved in crimes such as joyriding. In that time, I have increased the number of Garda special projects from 12 to 29 and there are a number of proposals for other projects before my Department. Any proposals arising from the Anti-Joyriding Task Force will be considered. The projects are tangible crime prevention measures and are run in conjunction with youth organisations. One such project is operating in the Dublin 17 area. Gardaí are also operating such initiatives as the Garda schools programme and the juvenile diversion programme.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the damage, both mental and physical, that joyriding inflicts on community life. I have complete confidence, however, in the capacity of the Garda Síochána to combat the problem and to discharge its role in maintaining law and order. I am aware that other areas of the city have also been affected recently, and my Department and the Garda will continue to monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill Deputy Broughan is in the course of drafting, obviously I cannot give him any commitment at this point, not having seen the legislation, but if he produces the Bill I will examine it and give it careful consideration. Deputy Broughan is also correct in stating that the Children Bill is now published and it should come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the not too distant future. The Bill is radically different from what the previous Government had proposed. A new Bill was necessary. I look forward to its passage through the Houses. It will have a major effect on juvenile justice. It will be the most radical departure in this area since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of the Garda Commissioner setting up a special unit, I will raise that matter with him for his comments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has come into the House this evening to debate this issue with me. I raise the issue of the need for escorts on buses which carry children with special needs to and from school. I have raised it in this House on a number of occasions previously. When I raised it initially I was told that the resources could not be made available.</P>
      <P>The Minister is from a rural background and I am sure he will empathise with me when I paint the picture of a five, six or seven year old child with special needs getting on a bus early in the morning to travel for almost three quarters of an hour to school. That bus may be carrying many children with special needs. These children are unsupervised and a great deal of messing goes on. They often take off their clothes or pinch each other and arrive at the school in a distressed state. I do not need to go on about this because the argument has been made in the past and, in principle, it has been won.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that last August, the Minister for Education and Science made funding avail<Col N="1178" /> able for this school transport, and I thank him on behalf of the parents and children for doing so. There is a problem, however. Whereas the issue has been solved in principle, in practice a problem still exists because most of these school buses do not carry escorts. Because the money was made available extremely late in the day, the teachers in the schools which were expected to administer the scheme were not prepared to administer it, and I understand a number of the cheques were returned. That was last August. We are now into November and the children continue to travel on the buses without escorts.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for these children? Is it the Department of Education and Science, the parents, the bus driver, the bus conductor or the school management? If an incident occurs and one of these children has a seizure or falls out of a bus, who will be responsible? The Minister will appreciate that parents are very concerned and they are anxious that the scheme be set up.</P>
    <P>The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but I understand meetings have not been held with the Department officials. Will the Minister take urgent action to resolve whatever misunderstanding exists between the school managements and the Department on this issue. If the school managements are unable or unwilling to administer the scheme &ndash; they have enough demands on their time &ndash; surely the Department can find the resources so that this urgently needed scheme can be administered through some other agency such as the vocational education committees or the Department itself. I know this is not the Minister's Department but coming from a rural constituency I am sure he understands the urgency. Will he ask his colleagues in Cabinet to do something about this matter before a serious incident or accident occurs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science has asked me to apologise to the Deputy and the House for his inability to be here to reply to the motion, and to say how grateful he is to the Deputy for the opportunity to address this issue.</P>
      <P>Since his appointment as Minister for Education and Science, he has been faced with demands that funding be made available for the appointment of escorts on special school transport services. From the outset, he has accepted the validity of the concerns of parents and others about the dangers to which special needs children can be exposed when travelling unaccompanied on these services.</P>
      <P>In an effort to address this issue, the Minister secured an allocation of £3.4 million to extend the escort scheme to every special school transport route in the country. He also made provision to increase the level of payment per escort from the £3,200 per annum which was paid under the original pilot escort scheme to £4,995. He secured these resources on the basis of the valid concerns which had been put to him by parents and schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> The Minister also took a view, which he still holds, that the most appropriate people to operate the escort scheme are the schools which are catering for the pupils in question on a daily basis. These schools know their children best. They are familiar with their children's behaviour and are best placed to select the most suitable people to carry out escort duties. The Minister is of the view that the involvement of schools, with their knowledge of the pupils, is crucial to ensuring an effective escort scheme which ensures the safety of the children and provides parents with the reassurance which they require.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to assure the Deputy that he is also aware of the concerns and reservations which have been expressed by some schools at taking responsibility for the escort scheme. While he appreciates that these concerns are validly held, he would point out that the pilot escort scheme which has been operating on more than 30 special transport routes for several years has not presented any of the difficulties which are now being raised.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also asked me to say that he is pleased that many of the schools involved in catering for special needs children have already confirmed their participation in the escort scheme and are already involved in appointing escorts for the routes serving their schools. Indeed, he asked me to take this opportunity to acknowledge the commitment shown by these schools in co-operating with the introduction of the scheme.</P>
    <P>He would like to assure the House that he fully appreciates the extra work involved for schools through their participation in the escort scheme. He also recognises that there may be individual schools for whom the introduction of the scheme presents real practical difficulties. He does not wish to be in any way dismissive of such difficult<Col N="1180" /> ies. Far from it, he has already indicated that his Department is prepared to consider any specific difficulties being encountered by individual schools in putting their escort service in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already had discussions with the national association which represents the boards of management of special schools in relation to this issue. He has asked me to say that he is pleased that the association has been extremely positive in welcoming the funding which has been made available for the introduction of the escort scheme on all special routes and has expressed its wish that all the schools involved should participate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also indicated to the national association that officials of his Department are available to meet with them to discuss possible ways of resolving any difficulties being encountered by particular schools in seeking to put their escort scheme in place. He has asked me to assure the Deputy that his Department will make every effort to accommodate any such difficulties.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Department met with representatives of the national association of boards of management in special schools on Tuesday, 9 November in an effort to resolve outstanding issues. At this meeting, the Department was advised of a number of specific concerns on the part of schools catering for special needs children and a number of suggestions to address these concerns were put forward by the association. The Department will now consider these matters in an effort to resolve outstanding difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister is hopeful that substantial progress can be made on this issue, so that escorts can be put in place on the remaining routes as soon as possible, in the interests of the children concerned and their parents.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 November 1999.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority has overall responsibility for advising on and enforcing health and safety legislation and regulations. Health agencies, as with all other employers, have the responsibility for ensuring workplace health and safety.</P>
      <P>Health agencies need to be aware of the importance of their responsibilities under health and safety legislation. My Department has met with the Health and Safety Authority and it is currently in the process of forging strategic alliances with the country's eight health boards to promote their common objectives in the area of workplace health and safety. The Health and Safety Authority will work with health agencies to identify and prioritise the principal factors affecting safety and health in the health sector and encourage and support the development of good practices.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is also currently establishing an advisory committee on the health services sector under section 17 of the Health Safety and Welfare Act 1989. The committee will identify and prioritise the principal factors affecting health and safety in the health sector, having regard to the previous advisory committee report of 1992 and report to the authority its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of health and safety provisions is essentially one for the individual agencies to deal with on a day to day basis within their annual <Col N="1182" /> determination, service planning process and legal requirements under the health and safety acts. Additional funding available to me for health and safety initiatives for distribution to health agencies is limited and is provided to supplement initiatives at local level particularly those highlighted by the Health and Safety Authority such as training, occupational health, patient handling and violence to staff.</P>
    <P>In 1999 I provided £4.5 million in additional funding to supplement health and safety initiatives which are being undertaken at local level by health boards, hospitals and mental handicap homes. As in previous years it is intended to continue to support health and safety initiatives at local level by providing specifically designated funding in 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 64, 161 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware of pressures that are being experienced and that are anticipated as a result of growing demand for renal dialysis services and has been working with service providers and other relevant organisations in assessing the overall requirements of end-stage renal failure patients. These are being considered in the context of available funding for 2000 and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the new drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit, the primary aim is to bring about important improvements over previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow <Col N="1184" /> situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    <P>In addition, people who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the local health board will have regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant. In this regard, income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines has been introduced for the GMS scheme and the new drug payment scheme. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services and the new drug payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. The comprehensive range of the most modern therapies required to treat all conditions, which was available on the GMS continues to be paid for under the new scheme. This common list is subject to ongoing review and amendment on a monthly basis as new products become available. Additions and deletions are notified on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>In general, over the counter products, such as vitamin supplements and cosmetic type products, are not available under the schemes. However, if a medical card holder is suffering undue hardship obtaining a medicine which is not covered under the common list, he or she may apply to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board for assistance in such instances.</P>
    <P>Representations have been received in my Department on behalf of kidney patients concerning items not included in the common list, notably, phosphate absorbents, vitamin supplements and high factor sun screens. I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that with effect from 1 December 1999, calcichew, a phosphate absorbent, will be reimbursable on the common list. On foot of correspondence from the Irish Kidney Association, officials from my Department met recently with representatives from the association and explained that there are no plans to include the other products in the common list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt):</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy in relation to the care of older people is to maintain them in their own homes for as long as possible. I am very much aware that the role played by carers and home helps is vital to the success of this policy. In recognition of this, I allocated funding this year as follows: £3 million was allocated to health boards to bring the minimum rate of payment for all home helps up to £3.00 per hour from 1 April 1999. This is part of a phased improvement in the rate of pay for home helps, the next phase of which I hope to implement in the year 2000; a sum of £1.5 million was allocated to extend the coverage of home help service by providing more hours and to provide training courses for home helps; a sum of £1 million was allocated to health boards, specifically for the support of carers. This fund can be used for the benefit of carers in a flexible manner, based on local needs. The improvement of liaison and support for individual carers and voluntary groups who promote the interests of carers are examples of the type of support envisaged; I provided core funding of £170,000 to the Carers Association in 1999; I allocated £800,000 to enable more paramedical and nursing staff to be recruited for the home care of older people which, in turn, also assisted carers.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs also took measures earlier this year to improve assistance to carers through the carers allowance. He increased by £6 the carers allowance for carers over 66 years and by £3 the allowance for carers under 66 years. There was also a once-a-year payment of £200 towards the cost of respite care.</P>

However, there remains disagreement between the parties on this issue. At a meeting on 7 October the Health Service Employers' Agency, recognising that there are issues between the parties regarding administration of the influenza vaccine, and in order to resolve this dispute without delay, proposed that the issues be referred to an independent third party for adjudication. This offer was declined by the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the IMO that, notwithstanding the dispute regarding administration of the influenza vaccine, it has advised its members to provide the vaccine to the at-risk groups in the GMS free of charge.</P>
      <P>I remain hopeful that it will be possible to reach agreement on this issue and I would hope that the Irish Medical Organisation would reconsider the offer made by the Health Service Employers' Agency of referral of the issues in dispute to an independent third party.</P>

This resulted in the request to Mr. Kevin Duffy, deputy chairperson of the Labour Court, to facilitate talks on ways of addressing the issues within the framework of Partnership 2000.

      <P>According to figures received by my Department from the Health Research Board, a total of 1, 563 patients were in hospital for 20 years or more at 31 December 1997. However, I am advised that this figure should be treated with caution, as some persons may have been discharged from hospital without the relevant discharge information being forwarded for updating to the Health Research Board.</P>
      <P>To ensure the Deputy can have accurate information in reply to his question, I have asked my Department to contact each of the psychiatric hospitals and units in each health board area for the information requested. It will be collated by my Department and I will forward it directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In general, the reason patients remain in psychiatric hospitals for lengthy periods is that they suffer from enduring mental illness. In the past, all patients with mental illness were treated in psychiatric hospitals. However, the policy in recent years has been to transfer patients for whom it is appropriate to more suitable residential accommodation in the community. Health boards are continuing to pursue that policy and are developing additional residential places as resources permit.</P>

      <P>Planning for the Future published in 1984, recommended a restructuring of mental health services and in as far as possible, the provision of a comprehensive psychiatric service to meet the individual needs of people with mental illness in their own communities.</P>
      <P>The cost of each service area within the mental health service is published annually in the report of the inspector of mental hospitals. The cost of residential units would be an integral part of the total cost of each service. However, the unit cost per resident would be dependant on whether the unit concerned is a high support, medium support or low support residence and also on the number of people it accommodates and the number of staff which may be required for the unit. The inspector's report gives a description of all community services which are available and lists all the community residences by health board.</P>
      <P>Professional support is provided to residential units and the level of support provided is dependant on the needs of the residents. Residential units are visited by the sector teams and by the inspector of mental hospitals and the inspector's comments on the support provided are forwarded to the relevant health boards.</P>
      <P>All areas of the mental health services are encouraged to work in partnership with the voluntary sector which provides an important role in the provision of support services to community residences. Much of the professional support provided by voluntary organisations to persons suffering from a mental illness, for example, counselling, support groups, telephone helplines, newsletters etc., is funded by the health boards.</P>

However, I am advised by the North Eastern Health Board that it is difficult to show any trends in the occurrence of stillbirth either nationally or regionally in Ireland due to the fact that stillbirths were registered for the first time in Ireland in 1995 using a broader definition than previously.</P>
      <P>Up to 1994 stillbirths referred to late foetal deaths and were defined as at or over 28 weeks gestation. Since 1995 stillbirth is defined as at or over 500 grams or at a gestational age of 24 weeks or more.</P>
      <P>Statistics for 1995 have only recently become available and the number of stillbirths is so small that data for several years will be required to see any trends which could be related to environmental factors.</P>

      <P>I indicated in previous replies to questions and to Adjournment debates about domiciliary care allowance, that following receipt of a number of inquiries about the qualifying age for this allowance I arranged for the matter to be examined. I have provided full information on the findings of this examination in such replies. The outcome of the examination concluded that best international practice recognises the additional care required for children with a disability under two years of age. Very often it is not simply a matter of care but the kind and intensity of the care required. While the international experience varies in the type of and eligibility for schemes, the underlying trend is to offer some support to children under two years of age.</P>

      <P>In addition, I have allocated significant additional revenue and capital funding to enable the acute hospitals to meet the hospital care needs of the growing population. I allocated an additional £44 million and an additional £71 million in 1998 and 1999 respectively over the 1997 level of £17 million for service development funding provided for acute hospitals. As regards capital expenditure, I allocated £144 million in 1998 and £155 million in 1999 for capital developments, including hospitals, and this compares with capital allocations of £112 million in 1996 and £127 million in 1997. These allocations have resulted in a significant expansion of acute hospital services and in infrastructural developments in acute hospitals throughout the country. In the medium-term it will be possible for me to be more specific about the range and rate of development of the services when the national development plan is published shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 49, 57 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>The standard working week for non consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, is 39 hours. However, as part of an agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation, NCHDs may be rostered for duty for up to an average maximum of 65 hours per week. This includes periods spent on call as well as time actually at work. This agreement was re-negotiated as recently as 1997. The 1997 agreement includes provision for a mechanism designed to deal with situations where NCHDs feel they are being asked to work hours consistently in excess of those laid down in their rosters. Given the nature of the services provided by hospitals it is inevitable that the work periods laid down in rosters will be exceeded from time to time. The mechanism is designed to deal with persistent and serious breaches of agreed hours.</P>
      <P>The monitoring and control of doctors' working hours is the responsibility of local hospital managers and the consultant medical staff on whose teams the NCHDs work. The mechanism introduced in the 1997 contract provides a forum for hospital managers, consultants and NCHDs to deal with the problems which arise at local level.</P>
      <P>NCHDs as doctors in training were one of a number of groups excluded from the original EU Working Time Directive adopted in 1993. Other excluded groups were transport workers, sea fishermen and offshore oil and gas workers. Following adoption of the 1993 directive the European Commission endeavoured to bring forward proposals to deal with the excluded sectors. The Commission recognised that there would be serious difficulties in bringing these sectors within the precise scope of the 1993 directive. Therefore, the Commission embarked on a series of consultative exercises to address the specific requirements of the excluded sectors.</P>
      <P>Ireland has never opposed the idea of offering NCHDs a level of protection equivalent to that provided by the 1993 directive. However in so doing, any provisions covering hospital doctors would have to take account of the need to provide 24 hour medical cover for hospitals and of the need to afford reasonable continuity of care to patients. There would also have to be a reasonable transition period to reach the objective of 48 hours per week without significant disruption to the existing medical career structure. As you may be aware the medical manpower forum was established in 1998 to examine the entire issue of medical staffing in hospitals. One of the current problems is the imbalance between trainee posts &ndash; NCHDs &ndash; and career posts, i.e. consultants. This in part is a legacy of the creation of 400 extra NCHD posts in 1989-90 to allow for the introduction of the 65 hour week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1998 the European Commission published its proposals in relation to the excluded groups in the form of a draft directive to amend the 1993 directive. The Commission's proposals went to a Council working group for consider<Col N="1193" /> ation. A number of member states had varying degrees of difficulty with the Commission's proposals. Eventually the German Presidency presented a series of compromise proposals to a meeting of Labour and Social Affairs Ministers held on 25 May 1999. These included a 12 year transition period with a progressive reduction in hours to 48 hours at the end of the period. The United Kingdom, which had been holding out for a 15 year transition period, proposed a 13 year period. This was adopted in order to obtain unanimity. The issue is now being considered by the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of preparing for the implementation of the directive it has been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation to conduct a study of NCHD working hours. The study is being overseen by a joint steering group representing the Health Service Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children and the IMO. A notice was placed on 6 November in the European Journal inviting tenders for the conduct of the study. It is hoped that the fieldwork for the study will be conducted in the early months of next year with the report delivered by May 2000.</P>
    <P>I also anticipate that the recommendations of the Forum on Medical Manpower will have a significant impact on the working conditions of hospital doctors. These should lead to a more equitable distribution of the on-call burden as well as enhancing the career prospects for young doctors.</P>
    <P>I have to point out that the Department has progressively reduced junior hospital doctors' working hours over the years at considerable cost. The Department is committed to reducing them further in accordance with whatever legislation is adopted by the European Union. The proposals recently adopted by the Council of Ministers should allow for the reduction of junior doctors' hours in an orderly and progressive process which will safeguard patient care and will not jeopardise young doctors' reasonable career expectations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 156 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government identified in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the need to review medical card eligibility for the elderly. I am pleased to say that the Government has decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, which is being introduced over a three year per<Col N="1195" /> iod, began on 1 March this year. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, have increased by one-third and there will be similar increases in 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred in detail in the House to the publication of the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework on Inter-country Adoption Assessment.&rdquo;  This report was commissioned in light of the huge increase in demand and resultant lengthy waiting times for assessment being experienced in all of the health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following publication of the report, additional funding was allocated to health boards in respect of inter-country adoption assessment in 1999 on the basis of the waiting lists in December 1998. On this basis the Eastern Health Board received <Col N="1196" /> a sum of £213,000 in 1999. The board has advised of its proposals to recruit five additional social workers, some additional clerical support as well as funding towards improved office interview facilities. This will increase the complement of social work staff from nine to 14. These additional social workers are being recruited from an existing panel and appointed directly to the inter-country adoption services in the board. Their appointments have been prioritised in the board and are being processed as a matter of urgency. It should be noted that the waiting times in the board have been exacerbated by difficulties in the recruitment and retention of social workers in this area of work, particularly given the adverse media attention. In addition to the recruitment of new staff the board has also taken a number of initiatives to improve the service to applicants for inter-country adoption which will assist in reducing both the waiting period for assessment to commence and the assessment process itself. These measures include a maximum of ten hours contact during assessment, interviewing one referee only and the introduction of a feedback mechanism and a quality assurance system.</P>
    <P>In addition to the funding allocated to each of the health boards, a working group has been established and has begun the work of prioritising and planning implementation of the report's recommendations. This includes prioritising training in the standardised framework through the provision of a seminar to all workers in ICA before the end of the year; the commissioning of a detailed training manual for all stages of the framework; as well as back-up documentation for prospective adoptive parents. Based on the increase in staff assigned to inter-country adoption assessment, as well as the introduction of standardised framework model, it is hoped that there will be significant improvement in the number of assessments being completed by health boards during the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The approach to adoptions from non-convention countries is still under consideration in the Department. It is not the intention to exclude any countries with which we already have agreements or working arrangements in place which uphold the spirit and principles of the convention. However, the primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or the sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries in order to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned. Therefore, a child-centred approach incorporating structures and procedures which accord with good practice in inter-country adoption is being taken to the preparation of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 43, 53, 71, 73, 130, 131 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland.</P>
      <P>EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC defines a medicinal product as any substance or combination of substances for treating or preventing disease in humans or animals or which may be administered with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions. The directive does not make any distinction between conventional medicines and those medicinal products containing ingredients which may be described as natural or herbal.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board, in its recent guidelines on the interpretation of the EU definition of a medicinal product has revised and updated the similar guidelines published by my Department in 1988. The policy in regard to the controls in force in respect of medicinal products, including natural medicinal products has not changed in any significant way.</P>
      <P>If a product placed on the market includes a medicinal claim, the product concerned becomes a medicinal product and should be the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board under the Medicinal Product (Licensing and Sale) Regulations 1998. These regulations give effect in this country to the EU Council Directive 65/65/EEC. Before the board may grant an authorisation it must first be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product concerned. In the case of unlicensed products that may be available on the market, neither the safety, quality nor efficacy of such products would have been established by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Products containing the herb hypericum perforatum &ndash; St. John's Wort &ndash; are medicinal products and, as such, must be the subject of product authorisations from the Irish Medicines Board in order that they may lawfully be placed on the market in this country. The decision by the board to recommend that products containing St. John's Wort should be placed on medical prescription was taken following appropriate medical assessment by the board. This was subsequently advised to my Department. A number of reasons has been given by the board for its recommendation. These include the fact that the products appear to act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors. These products must therefore be used with particular care because of risks of interactions, not just with other medicines, but also with certain foods. Patients therefore may be at risk from <Col N="1199" /> hypertension, increased blood pressure, if these products were to be taken with certain other antidepressants, over the counter cough mixtures &ndash; sympathomimetics &ndash; and with foods rich in tyramine such as cheese, yeast extract and red wine. Side effects such as photosensitivity, gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and nervousness have also been reported. Furthermore, the board has expressed concern at the possible treatment of mild to moderate depression by use of an over the counter medicine. The board considers that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self diagnosis and self medication are inappropriate.</P>
    <P>In relation to medicinal products containing ginkgo biloba, the position is that such products have been subject to prescription only control since 1987.</P>
    <P>The placing of any medicinal product under prescription only control is carried out in the interest of protecting public health and safety and where it is considered appropriate that such products should be used only under medical supervision and advice. The criteria concerned are included in EU Council Directive 92/26/EEC concerning the classifications for supply of medicinal products for human use.</P>
    <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by both consumers and representative organisations regarding the decision to place products containing St. John's Wort under prescription only control and I would like to assure the Deputies that it is not my intention to in any way interfere with the rights of individuals to avail of appropriate medicines which they may wish to use. However, it is generally accepted that in the interest of consumer health and protection, some form of regulation of alternative medicines is desirable and this view is supported in principle by the health food and alternative medicines industry. My Department has ongoing contact with the European Commission through its various working groups and committees and I understand that the European Commission is currently considering what controls, if any, should be applied to health food products and natural medicines, including the possibility of providing simplified procedures for the licensing of alternative or traditional medicines, but no definitive proposals have been brought forward at this stage. While there is no definition of health food or foodstuff in European legislation, the forthcoming White Paper on Food Law, the aim of which is to simplify EU food legislation, may well make recommendations in this regard. Deputies may be interested to know that under European food law, no health claims may be made in relation to food. The White Paper is due to be published later this year.</P>
    <P>The position in other European countries is that products containing hypericum are usually treated as medicinal products and in some instances are subject to national marketing authorision procedures. While the prescription classification might currently be unique to this country <Col N="1200" /> within the EU, I am advised that the nature of the medical claims being made in support of the product and their promotion, particularly via the Internet, may also lead to greater controls, including prescription control in other countries.</P>
    <P>I would also like to clarify for Deputies that the recent guide published by the Irish Medicines Board has not altered the position in relation to homeopathic medicinal products. The Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations 1998 already contain provisions for a simplified registration procedure for certain of these products as required by Council Directive 92/73/EEC. Under these simplified arrangements, while quality and safety must be established, evidence of product efficacy is not required in order to obtain registration for placing on the market.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am not aware of any proposal that health foods or homeopathic medicinal products should be put under prescription only control nor is there any proposal that these products should be removed from non pharmaceutical outlets. I am also unaware of any attempt by the medical profession to preserve a monopoly for itself in this area.</P>

      <P> The provision of speech and language therapy services to people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the relevant health board. Funding of £3 million in 1998 and £3 million in 1999, increasing to £6 million full year cost in 2000, has been allocated to health boards for the development of physical and sensory disability services, including speech and language therapy services. Priorities for the allocation of this funding are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services, on which the boards, voluntary sector service providers and people with disabilities are represented. Speech and language therapy is one of the priority areas for development and the boards created ten additional therapist posts in 1998.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board may make arrangements for the supply without charge of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to persons suffering from a prescribed disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the findings referred to by the Deputy. In fact information made available to me recently from the national nutrition surveillance <Col N="1203" /> centre at NUI Galway based on a sample of 8,497 Irish school aged children in primary and post-primary schools and compared with similar data from 28 other European and North American countries shows that in relation to time spent exercising, Irish children rank about middle of all countries surveyed.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned about worrying overall developments which have emerged from the recent national lifestyle survey, Slan, in the areas of children's activity levels and dietary trends. The health promotion unit of my Department will be bringing forward new proposals in this area shortly.</P>
      <P>Currently my Department is involved in a number of developments in the area of child nutrition. A nutrition education at primary schools, NEAPS, programme has been developed by the health promotion unit of my Department in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science and the North Western Health Board. This programme, which is aimed at third and fourth class levels in primary school, is available for distribution to all primary schools through the health boards. The aim of the programme is to improve the level of nutritional knowledge in children and to develop the skills necessary to enable them to use that knowledge to implement change. An evaluation of the NEAP's programme has found it to be very successful.</P>
      <P>In addition, the health promotion unit, in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board, has also been actively conducting a peer-led education programme among low income groups. The food and health project is a nutrition education programme using a peer led community development approach and is aimed at low income women who are working within the home and who are primarily responsible for food shopping and preparation.</P>
      <P>The recently published cardiovascular health strategy Building Healthier Hearts contains a number of key recommendations to address the issue of overweight in children including the provision of nutritious foods in tuck shops and school canteens. It also calls for a greater emphasis on physical activity in the school setting for all ages and at all levels of ability.</P>

      <P>The report of the working group in the prevention of transmission of blood borne diseases in the health care setting was published in February of this year. It has been circulated to all health service agencies for their information and for the implementation of its recommendations. The report includes a comprehensive set of recommendations and guidelines on the prevention of the transmission of blood borne diseases. It also includes specific guidance to be followed by health institutions in the event of a health care worker becoming infected.</P>
      <P>The working group endorsed the general principle that an infected health care worker should be given maximum support and encouragement to disclose the fact that they had been infected or believed that they might be infected. The Medical Council's ethical guidelines for medical practitioners (1998) place a clear ethical duty on doctors to protect patients from harm. It would also be clearly unethical for a doctor who believed that he or she might be infected with a serious contagious disease not to seek and accept advice from professional colleagues on the limitations which they would need to place on their practice in order to protect their patients. In the rare cases where a doctor is unable to continue to practice in their particular branch of medicine, the working group recommended that retraining or redeployment within the health service should be made available.</P>
      <P>These recommendations raise complex and difficult issues. The rights of patients to safe treatment and the right of health care professionals to privacy need to be carefully balanced. These issues are being considered by my Department. A request for a meeting with the Irish Medical Organisation was received at the end of September. I hope the IMO and other interested groups will be met in the near future.</P>

      <P>Statistical information on the number of people with an intellectual disability in Ireland is provided by the national intellectual disability database. The first report of the database was published in 1996 at which time the total number of people on the database was 26,664.</P>
      <P>The preliminary 1998 data has identified an increase of 1,346 persons, from 26,664 in 1996 to 28,010 in 1998, in the overall number of persons on the database. The data also indicates an increase in the numbers of persons who have been identified as requiring residential and-or day services. A total of 2,530 persons will require a major element of service over the next five years. This represents an increase of 171 persons over similar data in 1996.</P>
      <P>The number of additional places required over the period in question, that is, 1999 to 2003, to meet these needs are 1,673 residential places and 952 day places. When the additional placements coming on stream in 1999 have been taken into account, there is a balance of approximately 1,353 residential and 752 day places to be provided.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of £12 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, was provided for these services. This funding is in addition to the £6 million already allocated to the services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional funding provided for the services in 1999 to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000. Evidence of both my commitment and that of the Government to the ongoing development of services for persons with an intellectual disability is clearly demonstrated by the level of additional funding, £53 million up to the end of 1999, increasing to £59 million in 2000, which has been made available to these services since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>While this funding has made a significant impact, the accelerated provision of further additional resources for these services remains one of my priorities. I am currently pursuing the provision of this funding in the context of the Estimates process for 2000 and the national development plan. I am confident that the Government's budgetary measures for the coming year will have due regard to the levels of need which have been identified.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals before my Department at present for the development of xenotransplantation in this country. I do not propose, at this point, to introduce guidelines in this area.</P>
      <P>I am aware that advances have been made in international research into xenotransplantation. However, it is important to state that xenotransplantation is not yet an established clinical practice. Indeed it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty when, if ever, it would be feasible to introduce this procedure into practice in this country.</P>
      <P>If xenotransplantation is to become routinely available as a medical therapy, a number of technical, ethical and clinical issues will first need to be addressed. It will be necessary, in particular, to ensure that all necessary safeguards are in place to address safety concerns arising from the transplantation of animal organs into humans. In addition, the potential impact on the patient, the family and the wider population will need to be identified and addressed.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to monitor developments in the area of xenotransplantation in association with international colleagues. The Council of Europe has established a working group to examine this area and the work of the group will be closely followed by my Department. I am also aware that the United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority &ndash; UKXIRA &ndash; has recently circulated a draft document on infection surveillance for consideration and discussion within the UK in relation to xenotransplantation. The discussion document proposes, among other requirements, that lifelong compliance with the post-operative regime for any xenotransplantation is likely to require the patient to agree to use barrier contraception for life and to refrain from pregnancy or fathering a child. The option of developing guidelines in Ireland in this area will be reviewed in the light of further advances.</P>

I am supportive of approaches, which allow for fair comparison of performance between hospitals, be it at national or local level. I note that the material referenced by the Deputy is related to the establishment of a national health service accreditation programme in France. In this context, I am pleased that the scheme to put in place an accreditation programme for our major academic teaching hospitals, which I have resourced, is making excellent progress. The programme is designed to be ready by the end of <Col N="1208" /> next year and I am certain it will make a major contribution to measuring the quality of care against objective standards and promoting best performance in our hospitals.</P>

      <Quest>the procedures in place to review the detention of patients detained under the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1961; when these reviews take place; when the last review was held in respect of the 72 patients held for more than 30 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, a person may be admitted to a psychiatric hospital or unit and detained without his or her consent as a temporary patient or as a person of unsound mind. A temporary patient may not be detained for longer than six months in the first instance, but this period may be extended by further periods of six months, subject to a maximum of two years in total. A &ldquo;person of unsound mind&rdquo; is a person who requires detention for care and protection and who is unlikely to recover within six months. A person of unsound mind may be detained for an indefinite period. Under current legislation there is no system for the automatic review of a decision to detain a person in a psychiatric centre or any subsequent decision to extend detention. In practice, involuntarily detained patients are reviewed by their consultant psychiatrists who determine whether patients ought to be discharged or detained for a further period.</P>
      <P>Any person may apply to the Minister for an order under section 222 of the Act for a detained patient to be examined by two medical practitioners, and on consideration of their report, I may direct the discharge of the patient. Any relative or friend of a person detained may make an application to the clinical director under section 220 of the Act for the discharge of a patient to his or her care. The application must be granted unless the clinical director is of the view that the person will not be properly taken care of or certifies that the patient is dangerous or otherwise unfit for discharge, in which event an appeal against refusal of the application lies to the Minister. A detained patient can challenge the lawfulness of his or her detention in the courts. Under Article 40.4.2º of Bunreacht na hÉireann a person may seek an order for his or her release on the grounds that the detention is unlawful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1999, I announced that the Government had approved the main features of the new Mental Health Bill, which will be published during the current Dáil session. The proposed Mental Health Bill will significantly reform the law in relation to persons involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care and treatment and will bring Irish mental health law into conformity with <Col N="1209" /> the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>The new Bill will significantly improve the review procedures of detained patients and will provide for the establishment of an independent body, the Mental Health Commission, to ensure that the interests of persons with a mental illness or a mental disorder are protected and to oversee the process of independent review of involuntary admission to psychiatric centres by mental health tribunals. Each decision to involuntarily admit a person for psychiatric care and treatment will be reviewed automatically by an independent mental health tribunal, consisting of a lawyer and a consultant psychiatrist, operating under the auspices of the proposed Mental Health Commission. The review will be completed within 28 days of a person's involuntary admission. A decision of a tribunal to extend a period of involuntary admission beyond an initial term of 28 days may be appealed through the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy in relation to the care of older people is to maintain them in their own homes for as long as possible and I am very much aware that the role played by carers is vital to the success of this policy.  In recognition of the contribution made by carers a sum of £1 million was allocated to health boards in 1999, specifically for the support of carers. This fund can be used for the benefit of carers in a flexible manner based on local needs. The improvement of liaison and <Col N="1210" /> support for individual carers and voluntary groups who promote the interests of carers are examples of the type of support envisaged. I have also provided core funding of £170,000 for the Carers Association in 1999. A further £800,000 was provided in 1999 to enable more home helps, paramedical and nursing staff to be recruited for the home care of older people which, in turn, also assisted carers.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs also took measures earlier this year to improve assistance to carers through the carer's allowance. He increased by £6 the carer's allowance for carer's aged 66 years and over and by £3 the allowance for carers under 66 years. There was also a once-a-year payment of £200 towards the cost of respite care.</P>
      <P>I am committed to providing more day care centres, short-term and holiday relief care, night-sitting, which would free the carer for a number of hours, and domiciliary relief care. I accept that there is some distance to go in developing such a network and it is my intention to develop a comprehensive range of services both institutional and community based for older people, including specialist geriatric units, extended care, home nursing, home helps, paramedical services, day care and respite care on a phased basis over the next few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 158 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to provide a cost for the inclusion of asthma in the long-term illness scheme as figures are not available on the number of people suffering from asthma in this country. <Col N="1211" /> Figures available from the General Medical Services (Payments) Board in regard to asthma medication for 1998 under the old drug cost subsidisation scheme show a cost in excess of £10 million. However, this scheme was provided in conjunction with the old drugs refund scheme, which was operated by the health boards and was based on family expenditure on drugs rather than on individual expenditure or specific illnesses. Definitive information on the cost of asthma medication under that scheme is not available on the drugs refund scheme. In relation to data on asthma drugs, it should also be noted that asthma is not necessarily the only diagnosis and other conditions could include bronchitis and emphysema.</P>
    <P>The list of illnesses covered by the long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme, having regard to the other schemes available to help people with the cost of drugs and medicines. For example, people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the local health board has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders can avail of the drugs payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. The primary aim of the new scheme is to bring about improvements over previous schemes and it is designed to be user friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any systematic evidence that would support the view that better care and more efficient taking of medicines might ensue if asthma was included under the long-term illness scheme.</P>

This matter has been the subject of many representations to my Department.</P>
      <P>The personal assistance service is part of a range of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities designed to enable them to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence.

      <P>To date, this Government has provided a total of £38.162 million for the maintenance and development of services in the sector, including capital developments.

      <P>I support the concept of clinical audit in the context of promoting quality in our health services and ensuring the best possible service for patients. In fact, the consultant's common contract for appointment requires that each consultant, in the context of their management responsibility, participate in creating and operating a clinical audit system. This assessment must be undertaken through a peer review system in which the confidentiality of the patient and the doctor is preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a policy of supporting continuous quality improvement in the health sector, my <Col N="1215" /> Department has recently agreed to, and provided funding for, the development of an accreditation scheme, on a pilot basis, for the acute general hospital system. The development of hospital accreditation offers the potential either to verify high standards or address shortcomings within the hospital sector. The pilot scheme will be concentrated initially in the major academic teaching hospitals, and will be structured in a way that it could eventually encompass other hospitals and agencies. The scheme will involve health professionals and will be designed to provide added value for patients and other clients of the hospitals involved.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the scheme will be to have an accreditation system in place that will allow public hospitals to assess their performance against an objectively agreed set of standards and, within this framework, to create an environment of continuous review and improvement of structures, processes and outcomes. The objective of this approach is to promote patient and public confidence in the public hospital system and to develop a consistently high quality and patient-centred service.</P>
    <P>The details and phasing of the scheme are now being finalised and the scheme will commence in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>if EU pensioners living in Ireland are entitled to medical cards without a means test; and the proposals, if any, he has to extend similar cover to the elderly in Ireland.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements under EU regulations supersede the provisions of the Irish eligibility system in respect of certain categories of nationals of other EU states. Where this situation arises, health boards are obliged to provide health services, on the same basis as medical card holders, for these people on behalf of their home state, which retains responsibility for the costs involved in the provision of the services.</P>
      <P>As a result pensioners in receipt of social security pensions from other EU states who are ordinarily resident in Ireland, not covered by an Irish social welfare pension, as recipient or dependant, and who are not employed or self-employed here, are entitled to receive health services free of charge and are normally issued with a medical card.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, that is medical card holders, or limited eligibility for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments, on health policy grounds to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided that the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over should be doubled. This improvement, <Col N="1217" /> which is being introduced over a three year period, began on 1 March this year. The income guidelines for those aged 70 to 79 and 80 years and over, which are already higher than the normal guidelines, have increased by one third and there will be similar increases in 2000 and 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 79, 83, 84, 85, 86 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The timing of the presentation of the Donegal task force report enabled the investment programme which it recommended to be considered in the context of preparing the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006. On my recommendation, the Government decided that all relevant Departments should examine the report and consider the investment priorities it proposes in drafting the operational programmes of the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force's report recommends that implementation of its development strategy should be assigned to a new county development board which would need to be constituted and organised for this task. Pending the establishment of the county development board, the report envisages the establishment of a county executive forum, which would include representatives of <Col N="1220" /> the relevant Departments and agencies to progress the implementation of the priority actions recommended. I will be meeting with the chairman and members of the task force on 23 November 1999 to discuss the implementation of the report's recommendations. In the light of the foregoing, it has not been considered necessary to convene particular interdepartmental meetings in relation to the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>In relation to recommendation 1.2.6 regarding the economic development fund, my view is that the prospects for any expansion of the size of the fund should be based on an assessment of its objectives and a performance appraisal of its operation to date. Paragraphs 1.3.2 and 1.4.1 of the report recommend that a seven year spending allocation of £732 million be approved by Government to meet the cost of the investment priorities recommended by the task force. Given that our national development plans are formulated and implemented on the basis of national investment priorities which are centrally co-ordinated, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to carve out a specific budget for Donegal over the period of the plan. Adopting a piecemeal approach on a county by county basis would be the antithesis of having an integrated, centrally co-ordinated national development plan. I believe the decision taken by the Government, as mentioned above, is more appropriate.</P>

      <P>The Donegal employment initiative recommended that job creation targets should be established for the county and broken down within different sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>I believe that the real merits of the strategy set out in the report of the Donegal employment initiative do not revolve around particular target numbers, which are intended only as indicative figures and as a guide to the development agencies. The main objective should be to point the direction of change and to move in that direction as strongly as possible using the recommendations for action outlined in the report.</P>
      <P>The Donegal employment initiative acknowledged that its overall target, derived from the indicative job creation targets identified at paragraph 1.4.2 in its report, represented an ambitious goal for achievement in eight years. The development agencies view some of the sectoral targets as unrealistic given the historic performance of their respective portfolios. The adoption of county level targets throughout the country would reduce the promotional flexibility of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

This should have a significant impact in Donegal and is reflected in the IDA's commitment to: providing a significant grant differential in favour of the Objective One region, including Donegal; restructuring its organisation to place increased emphasis on regional development and, in particular, on the Objective One region; expanding its Donegal regional office through the creation of two new posts in Letterkenny to work exclusively on promoting Donegal.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has also reorganised its structure to deal with regional issues, including action arising from the work of the Donegal task force. Enterprise Ireland is committed to giving priority to Donegal in identifying and supporting job-creating initiatives.</P>
    <P>Regional aid guidelines and the rules attaching to the next round of Structural Funds for the Objective One region will enable the agencies to assist companies at higher rates in the region.</P>

      <P>On 12 February 1999 my Department received from Waterford County Council an application for a licence under the Foreshore Act to allow for the development of the Dungarvan sewerage works. The application, which included a comprehensive environmental impact statement, was considered by my Department. In order to allow for public consultation Waterford County Council was requested on 13 August, pursuant to the Foreshore (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1990, to advertise the works in a local newspaper. The works were advertised in the <i>Dungarvan Leader</i> on 10 September.</P>
      <P>The environmental impact statement, together with a copy of all plans and drawings, were made available for inspection at the offices of the applicant and at Dungarvan Garda station. The public was given one month from the date of publication to make submissions or objections to me on the proposed works. No such submissions or objections were received. On 27 October Waterford County Council forwarded proof that documents had been so displayed.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently compiling a report for me on the proposals. I expect to be able to communicate my decision to Waterford County Council in the near future.</P>

      <P>Recommendation 1.3.9. of the Donegal employment initiative task force deals with the marine sector priorities and identifies a total investment requirement of some £84 million, requiring State aid of £42 million. This recommendation is in total accord with the findings of the participative conference on investment and employment opportunities in the marine sector in County Donegal that I convened last year.</P>
      <P>On foot of this I have taken a number of steps to build on the potential of Donegal's marine sector. These include a £4 million investment in harbour infrastructure this year; approval and commencement of a new £20 million landing facility in Killybegs; and the provision of funding under the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme for the extension of the national fisheries training centre in Greencastle. These investments alone account for over half of the £42 million State aid proposed in the task force's report.</P>
      <P>Investment in fleet improvements, aquaculture and processing is ongoing, but I am conscious of the need for increased investment in these sectors. In the context of the national development plan and the next round of Structural Funds I am making every effort to maximise funding for the marine sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews):</NameTxt>
      <P>My assessment of human rights conditions in Turkey coincides to a large extent with the most recent assessment of the European Commission, published in October. There has been little evolution in this area over the past year, although there have been some improvements reflecting the intention of the Turkish authorities to counter human rights abuses by public officers. In this respect several legislative and administrative measures have been adopted recently. However, I remain concerned about shortcomings in terms of respect for human rights and the rights of minorities and about the constitutional role which the army plays in political life through the National Security Council. With regard to the case of Mr. Öcalan, Ireland, together with our EU partners, has strongly urged the Turkish authorities not to carry out the death sentence.</P>
      <P>On 26 June 1999 Prime Minister Ecevit promised that the Government would undertake legal reform to improve Turkey's human rights record. He explained that the Government's priority is to develop democracy, improve human rights, expand freedom of thought and ensure an effective judicial system. The strengthening of Turkey's links with the European Union depends on Turkey's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU and respect for and protection of minorities.</P>
      <P>Nationwide elections to the Turkish Grand National Assembly were held on 18 April 1999 on the basis of universal adult suffrage and the secret ballot. Five political parties secured representation in the 550 seat assembly, and a new Turkish Government was elected. On 9 June the new Government won a parliamentary vote of confidence by a margin of 354 to 182. The Government has produced a wide-ranging programme which includes proposals for parliamentary and judicial reform, modernisation of the social security system and the granting of limited amnesty to Kurdish rebels who surrender.</P>
      <P>The Luxembourg European Council of December 1997 confirmed that Turkey's eligibility for EU accession would be examined on the basis of the same criteria as for other applicant states. It is my hope that the Turkish Government will continue its present course of reform and improvement in respect for human rights in order to meet the political and economic criteria necessary for the opening of EU accession negotiations.</P>

      <P>There has been substantive progress by the Russian Federation in the human rights area in recent years, despite often difficult economic and political circumstances. Political pluralism and free expression of opinion have been achieved. Russian ratification of a number of Council of Europe conventions, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, the anti-torture convention, the European Charter for Local Self-Government and the Convention on the Protection of National Minorities represent key steps taken on the road to reform. Nevertheless, in many fields, further efforts are necessary. There are positive indications &ndash; the recent transfer of responsibility for the penitentiary system to the Ministry of Justice; the entry into force of new civil and criminal codes; and the respect for the moratorium on the death penalty, indicate Russia's commitment to ensuring that the system of common European democratic values and standards is enshrined in its domestic law and practice.</P>
      <P>Russian presidential and parliamentary elections take place regularly, most recently in 1996 and 1995 respectively. Under the constitution of December 1993 the Russian Federation is a democratic, federative, multi-ethnic republic, in which state power is divided between the legislature, executive and the judiciary, which are independent of one another. The President, who is Head of State, is elected by universal suffrage for a term of four years and holds broad executive powers. Supreme legislative power is vested in the bicameral Federal Assembly. The Federal Assembly consists of an upper chamber, the 176 member Federation Council, and the lower chamber, the 450 member state Duma, elected by universal suffrage for a period of four years. The next Duma elections take place on 19 December and the next presidential elections have been fixed for June 2000.</P>
      <P>It is my hope that Russia will continue on the path of reform and improvement in respect for human rights, and that the present Chechnya conflict will be resolved by political means through negotiations between the Russian Government and elected leaders of the north Caucasus, including Chechnya.</P>

    </P>
    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews): No CIS country has formally applied for membership of the European Union, although a number of these countries, even countries outside of Europe, may aspire to membership at some unspecified time in the future. The only country of the CIS which has been pressing for EU recognition of its eventual candidature for membership of the Union is Ukraine.</P>
    <P>While there has been progress in the general human rights area in Ukraine, there are still a number of areas where further progress is needed. For instance, Ukraine is concerned with the Council of Europe threat to expel the Ukrainian delegation because of its failure to honour its commitment, given on accession to the Council of Europe in November 1995, to abolish the death penalty. No group in Parliament is prepared to propose a Bill for its abolition at present.</P>
    <P>A Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly fact-finding visit to Ukraine in October found that coverage of the presidential electoral campaign by the state media appeared to be strongly biased in favour of the outgoing President. The visit was the Parliamentary Assembly's response to an appeal lodged by four presidential candidates alleging serious breaches of the campaign rules and other irregularities, in particular concerning freedom of the press and candidates' equal access to the public media. The assembly underlined that a free and fair electoral campaign is an essential precondition for democratic elections.</P>
    <P>Following the adoption of a new constitution in June 1996 executive power is primarily vested in the Prime Minister and the Government, although the President retains some executive functions. The 450 member Verkhovna Rada, Parliament, has legislative power. The President is elected by universal suffrage for a period of five years. Parliamentary elections were held in the Ukraine on 29 March 1998. The leftist bloc, which holds 171 seats, is the largest grouping. The first round of presidential voting took place on 31 October. Incumbent President Kuchma received 36.39 per cent of the vote. In the second round on 14 November, President Kuchma will face communist leader Simonenko who won 22.4 per cent of the vote in the first round. This election will be very important in deciding the future direction of Ukraine, which at present is pressing very strongly to be included in all European organisations, including for a perspective for eventual EU membership. It is my hope that future developments will underline Ukraine's commitment to ensuring that the system of common European democratic values and standards is enshrined in its domestic law and practice.</P>
    <P>The Commonwealth of Independent States was established in December 1991, initially by Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, on the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Other former Soviet republics joined later, and all of these states, except the Baltic states, are now members. The primary purpose of the CIS is to promote econ<Col N="1227" /> omic, cultural and political co-operation between the member states. Its principal bodies, the Council of Heads of State and the Council of Heads of Government are supposed to meet at least twice yearly. Other ministerial councils, for instance, of Foreign and Defence Ministers, have also been established. It is reported that some member states, notably Azerbaijan, Georgia and Ukraine, participate only reluctantly in the CIS, partly because it is seen by some member states as a means of maintaining Russian influence in the former Soviet republics.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply of 5 October last in which I outlined my response to the many recommendations contained in the report.</P>
      <P>Work is progressing on three co-funded telecommunications projects being undertaken by Eircom and Esat Telecom in Donegal. These projects will support the development of advanced communications networks and services in the county.</P>
      <P>Esat Telecom will roll-out fibre optic cable in ten urban areas in the State, including Letterkenny. Eircom will install a 95 kilometre high capacity fibre optic cable along the west coast of Donegal, from Bunbeg to Donegal town and from Dunfanaghy to Falcarragh serving all communities &ndash; up to 71,000 people &ndash; along the route. Eircom will also upgrade communications infrastructure links from Moville by installing 20 kilometres of fibre optic cable and associated equipment from Quigley's point to Moville, thus making Moville a broadband access node. I understand that both companies have signed contracts for these projects and that they must be completed by 31 December 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eircom is also planning to provide 0.3 million euros from its own resources to help establish two technology information communication centres in <Col N="1229" /> Donegal which will provide IT and telecommunications services for local communities and businesses.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my reply to a similar question, No. 154 of 5 October 1999, the ESB's study of the supply options in the north-west is still ongoing and will set out the best option for strengthening the networks and their interconnection with Northern Ireland Electricity.</P>
    <P>The NIE was also recently successful in obtaining Trans-European Energy Network funding for a similar study in relation to its network. The ESB, together with the NIE, will continue to keep the question of further interconnection under active review.</P>
    <P>The prospects for the gas find in the Corrib field look promising though the consortium involved has indicated that further appraisals will have to be carried out before a decision can be taken on whether the field is to be developed commercially. I have urged the consortium to clarify its intentions as quickly as possible. Until there is more certainty about these events, it is not possible to say what their potential impact on gas supplies to Donegal would be.</P>

      <Quest>the reason farmers from the general Achill area of County Mayo who have commonage on their area aid applications are experiencing problems with their headage and premia payments in view of the fact that two Department officials from the area aid unit spent almost two days in that region in 1998 examining the maps and commonage and assurance had been given to farmers that everything was in order; the purpose of sending the two officials if the applications are not rectified; the reason farmers were led to believe the commonage problems were in order; and when these farmers will be paid.</Quest>

      <P>Two officials from my Department visited Achill on 19 and 20 April 1999 to assist farmers in resolving difficulties with their 1998 area aid applications. In the majority of cases examined, a resolution of the problem was achieved and headage and premium payments resulted.</P>
      <P>No assurances could be given by the officials in relation to 1999 applications, as it is at all times the responsibility of each applicant to complete and submit a correct application form. However, a number of farmers, who were experiencing difficulties with their 1999 application forms, requested and received assistance in completing certain aspects of the form. It should be noted that as the meeting was three days before the closing date for receipt of 1999 applications, most herdowners had already returned their forms and any problems in these forms have only become evident in the course of processing.</P>
      <P>In Achill there are in the region of 260 herdowners claiming a variety of different commonages held in different share values. The commonages in Achill, as elsewhere, have been the source of serious difficulties in processing area aid applications this year, mainly because farmers have not provided adequate proof of entitlement to such commonages.</P>
      <P>My Department recently advertised in local newspapers in a number of counties, including Mayo, urging farmers to supply the necessary proofs. My Department expects to resolve the bulk of these problems over the coming weeks.</P>

The proposals contained in the new national development plan in relation to agriculture and rural development relate mainly to: (i) on-farm capital investment, waste management, animal welfare, dairy hygiene; (ii) alternative enterprises, on and off-farm; (iii) local rural development type measures, including rural tourism, small scale food processing etc.; and (iv) CAP guarantee funded measures, namely, REPS, early retirement and compensatory allowances.</P>

As regards the measures at (iv) they will be operated under a CAP rural development programme.</P>
    <P>From an administrative aspect, the national schemes will be operated, as heretofore, by my Department. However, in relation to locally operated rural development programmes, the recommendation of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems, that Leader and the area partnerships be delivered by a single agency at local level has already been accepted by the Government. It is not planned to allocate funds for the above measures on a specific county basis but farmers and rural dwellers in County Donegal will benefit under the proposed measures as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The BES was due to finish on 5 April 1999. A paper prepared for the tax strategy group, in October 1998, concluded that information was not yet available to determine what effect the reduction in the aggregate amount a company could raise under the BES actually had on the scheme. However, initial indications were that the budget day changes had the desired effect in focusing the BES on smaller/start up companies. The Finance Act, 1999, extended the BES to 5 April 2001. The scheme will be reviewed again before any decision is taken on whether to extend it beyond 5 April 2001.</P>

In Comhairle na nOspidéal's report on consultant manpower for 1 January 1999 the North Eastern Health Board region has a consultant establishment &ndash; consultant posts filled, approved but vacant, unprocessed and under consideration &ndash; of 82.

    <P>It is acknowledged that a number of services still have some way to go towards adequate provision of day hospital services in their sectors. However, it must be stressed that great strides have been made in many health board areas in the provision of community mental health services since the publication of the report &ndash; Planning for the Future in 1984. These services will continue to be developed as resources permit.</P>

      <P>Government policy in relation to drug misuse is that a wide range of drug treatment options should be provided, including methadone maintenance, detoxification and other programmes aimed at those addicted to drugs, especially those addicted to heroin. The overall aim is to restore people to a drug free lifestyle, although it is recognised that this may not be a realistic goal for some long-term drug users, especially in the short-term.</P>
      <P>Where a substitution drug is recommended for the treatment of opiate dependence methadone is the preferred option. However, the medical consultants involved in the treatment of such patients and who advise my Department on the best treatment options for drug misusers continually monitor and investigate new treatment therapies. Ibogaine is being monitored by the consultants in substance misuse but at present there is insufficient data to use this drug outside of the research setting. If, however this drug is proven to be efficacious in the treatment of drug misuse it will be carefully considered by the consultants involved for use in a drug treatment programme.</P>

Among the issues which it is intended to address are the promotion of responsible sexual behaviour among young people, increased awareness on the use of contraception, promotion of male contraceptive responsibility and the cultivation of more responsible attitudes to alcohol with particular regard to alcohol and sexual activity.</P>
      <P>I understand that social personal health education in schools includes amongst its objectives the promotion of male responsibility towards contraception. The operation of this programme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

    <P>In relation to breast cancer, the international evidence is that screening women aged over 50 years is effective when organised in a population-based quality-assured programme. The first phase of a national breast screening programme in Ireland is at a very advanced stage and screening is to commence shortly.</P>
    <P>In the case of bowel cancers, there is varying international evidence regarding the efficacy of screening. The National Cancer Forum, which advises me on issues relating to cancer services, is currently considering the most appropriate approach to evaluating the appropriateness of a number of screening programmes for cancers, such as colo-rectal cancer and prostate cancer. At present, there is no clear evidence of an effective screening programme for lung cancer.</P>

      <P>Consumption of tobacco increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from a wide range of illnesses. These include cancers, diseases of the heart and circulatory system, and respiratory conditions. As these are not notifiable diseases, information on the number of visits to general practitioners is not available. Data on hospital discharges are collected through the hospital in-patient inquiry system which covers all publicly funded acute hospitals and mortality data are collected by the Central Statistics Office. Table 1 below sets out statistics for 1998 showing the number of hospital discharges for conditions regarded as smoking related. The number of deaths for the same conditions are provided in table 2 for the years 1994 to 1998. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of these figures since they include all hospitalisations and deaths from the specified illnesses irrespective of whether or not they were due to smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the publication &ldquo;Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries 1950-2000&rdquo; by Richard <Col N="1246" /> Peto and others it is estimated that in 1995, 20 per cent of all deaths in Ireland could be attributed to smoking. Similar proportions are not available for morbidity, and it is therefore not possible to estimate with any precision the share of hospitalisations for smoking related illnesses which are due either directly or indirectly to smoking.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 143, 144, 145, 148 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>The medical manpower forum is a major initiative to review medical staffing structures in public hospitals. Among the issues being examined are the provision of the highest quality of medical care to patients; addressing the imbalance in hospitals between career posts and training posts; addressing the gender imbalance at consultant level; the need to improve postgraduate medical training; and the provision of greater career opportunities for non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
      <P>As part of the consultative process, these items have featured in discussions with the medical organisations together with altered responsibilities for existing consultants; the introduction of a new grade of hospital consultant; and the need to provide greater on-site consultant cover in public hospitals, especially at night and at weekends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the medical manpower forum is considering overall medical staff numbers for Ireland, the provision of consultants for individual specialities, such as general internal medicine is a matter in the first instance for the relevant <Col N="1248" /> health board or hospital in association with Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of the forum, a discussion document on assistants in surgical practice was presented. This document does not propose that nurses would perform invasive surgery but illustrates ways in which the work of operating theatres could be restructured.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum is preparing an interim report which is nearing completion and which will contain a number of proposals to address the matters outlined.</P>

      <P>I have indicated in previous replies to questions and to Adjournment debates about domiciliary care allowance, that following receipt of a number of inquiries about the qualifying age for this allowance, I arranged for the matter to be examined. I have provided full information on the findings of this examination in such replies. The outcome of the examination concluded that best international practice recognises the additional care required for children with a disability under two years of age. Very often it is not simply a matter of care but the kind and intensity of the care required. While the international experience varies in the type of, and eligibility for schemes, the underlying trend is to offer some support to children under two years.</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): Having reviewed the figures for the first three quarters of this year as compared with the same period in 1998, the numbers awaiting cardiac surgery are marginally less in 1999, with an average decrease of 54 patients. These figures are based on waiting list statistics collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department for the quarters ending March, June and provisional figures for September.</P>
    <P>In 1998, I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The cardiac surgery waiting list initiative has a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list. The total number of public patients awaiting cardiac surgery has reduced from 1,619 in September 1997 to 1,106 in June 1999, this represents a reduction of 32 per cent.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 and 169 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of persons awaiting hip replacements, according to the Department's figures of 30 June 1999, was 1,180. This is a slight increase <Col N="1253" /> compared to the June 1998 figure of 1,164. However, it is a significant decrease in the March 1999 hip replacement waiting list figure of 1,317.</P>
    <P>The corresponding waiting list figures for the removal of cataracts also show an increase when compared to June 1998. The number waiting at 30 June 1999 was 3,156 compared to 2,644 in June 1998.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office, I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies who achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>
    <P>I am confident the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represents the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

      <P>The provision of services for persons with disabilities in County Kildare is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Health Board. While significant additional resources have been made available to these services in recent years, there is an ongoing need to further develop services for this group. Priorities for the development of services are agreed by the board, in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with physical or sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>With reference to services for persons with an intellectual disability, additional revenue funding amounting to £3.635 million was provided in 1999, with a full year cost of £4.610 in the year 2000. Capital funding amounting to £4.15 million, of which £3.3 million was to support the new developments was also allocated to the board in 1999. Eighteen new places, six respite and three full-time emergency places, in addition to seven short-term crisis places, have been provided from this funding. Capital funding amounting to £425,000 was also allocated to support the Kildare developments.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £1.080 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £2.16 million in the year 2000, has been provided for the development of services for persons with a physical or sensory disability. Capital funding amounting to £1.234 million was provided to the Eastern Health Board to support new developments. Five new residential places have been provided from this funding.</P>
      <P>The Government is also committed to the ongoing development of services for people with disabilities and I am pursuing the allocation of further resources in the context of the 2000 budgetary process and the national development plan.</P>

      <P>I have received no direct submissions from the Kildare Carers Association. However, the Deputy can be assured that the support for carers <Col N="1255" /> is one of my top priorities in relation to services for people with disabilities and services for older people. In services for people with an intellectual disability, I have put in place a capital programme in place which, beginning in 1998, will run over a four year period and, among other things, will provide new residential, respite and day care facilities. Since coming into office I have provided an additional £38.162 million for people with physical and sensory disabilities which has provided additional residential, respite, day care and home support services.</P>
      <P>On services for older people a sum of £7 million additional revenue was provided in 1998 for the expansion of community services in order to improve support for older people in their homes. A further £1 million was allocated to the health boards in 1999 to support carers in a flexible manner on local needs and a further £800,000 was allocated to the boards for the recruitment of additional paramedical and nursing staff to be assigned to home care of older people.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware also of the substantial package of improvements in the carer's allowance, worth £18 million, put in place in the 1998 budget by my colleague the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland. Roaccutane, isotretinoin, is a vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of acne. In Ireland, it is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board for the treatment of severe acne, unresponsive to other treatments, and its availability is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a consultant dermatologist. I am aware that there have been reports in Ireland in the past of possible adverse reactions to the drug, including two reports of suicide suspected in association with its use, one of which I understand refers to an Irish person who was resident in the United Kingdom and treated there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has in the past, and continues on an ongoing basis, to actively monitor all available data on roaccutane including reports of adverse reactions, which it reviews both internally with its own experts and with the other European regulatory agencies. The board has also recently reviewed the terms of the authorisation for the product. As a result of this, revised wording for inclusion in the prescribing information for the product, outlining the current position regarding its use and warnings related to the possible development of psychiatric reactions were agreed. The warnings refer to possible side <Col N="1256" /> effects, including depression, psychotic symptoms, and to rare reports of suicide associated with roaccutane. The revised warnings have been incorporated into the authorisation documents for the product and all physicians and pharmacists have been notified of the new warning regarding the use of roaccutane. Revised warnings have also been provided for in the package labelling and patient information leaflets. In addition, at the request of the IMB, the manufacturer has recently initiated a post-marketing surveillance programme to monitor all patient usage of roaccutane in Ireland. All data collected during this surveillance programme will be reviewed and analysed by the IMB and any further regulatory action required will be taken, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the board continues to actively monitor the safety profile of the product and I am assured that it will take any action that may be necessary having regard to the risk-benefit ratio relating to the product.</P>

At this meeting, political agreement was reached on a common position on a proposed directive on the incineration of waste, which aims to consolidate and extend the scope of existing directives relating to the incineration of municipal and hazardous wastes.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the stringent operational controls and emission standards that are contained in this proposal, and look forward to its early adoption by the Community. The strict control regime which is provided for in the proposed directive has largely been anticipated under the integrated pollution control licensing system operated by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA may not grant an integrated licence unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not endanger human health or harm the environment.</P>

The grants may be made for renovation or acquisition of premises, the purchase of equipment, once-off publications or research or other special projects. Organisations that may apply for funding under this scheme include: community development and area development organisations and groups working in particularly disadvantaged areas; family support groups providing assistance to young families, one-parent families and others in need of special support, whose work is aimed at tackling disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit; welfare rights and information groups providing information and support services for the unemployed and other disadvantaged groups; and co-ordinating and umbrella organisations, whose members or affiliate groups work on behalf of disadvantaged communities or groups.</P>

      <P>pension from 19 April 1996, which was six months prior to the date of claim. This was the maximum period of backdating then allowable under the legislation applicable in her case.

Under these arrangements, the person concerned received a further 44 weeks arrears of pension amounting to £2,954.70.</P>
      <P>The only circumstances in which further arrears could be paid would be in the event of proven incapacity on the part of the applicant to apply for pension on time, force majeure, Departmental error, or to alleviate current financial hardship.

This funding is provided by way of grant <Col N="1263" /> to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £5 million has been allocated to the scheme this year. In general, grants under the scheme cover from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary security equipment. While the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the total cost, it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme. The actual amount of the grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera):</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to this matter is that there is a standard procedure used to assess damage on commonages caused by unsustainable stocking levels and an appropriate destocking level is derived from this assessment. The procedure used in the commonage referred to is the same as that used in all other commonages for which plans have been and will be prepared. I am arranging to have the document that sets out the procedure sent to the Deputy. The criteria used in the production of commonage framework plans have resulted in a wide range of levels of de-stocking being indicated within the plans completed to date. In relation to the commonage referred to by the Deputy, the destocking calculations are broken into blocks for operational purposes. The resulting destocking rates are indicative only of the destocking rate for each of these blocks. However, the destocking rate for each farmer will be calculated on the average destocking rate across his commonage rights. The relationship between these blocks and <Col N="1265" /> the final destocking requirements for each individual farmer has not yet been determined.</P>
      <P>In any particular commonage where the commonage shareholders as a whole dispute the destocking level, derived from the commonage framework plan, they may submit a joint application to Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development requesting a review of their plan. Arrangements will then be made to reassess the particular commonage in question in accordance with the approved criteria for the preparation of these plans.</P>

      <P>I would mention that my role in the vessel's future at this point is strictly confined to deciding the issue in relation to the application for a licence to alter it under the National Monuments Acts.

      <P>I am aware of recommendation 1.1.8 of the Donegal Task Force Initiative in relation to child care support for areas of high unemployment. The Deputy may be aware that my Department provides funding for the development of community based child care facilities, particularly in disadvantaged areas, under the equal opportunities child care programme. The programme operates from a social inclusion and equal opportunities perspective. It supports the development of child care facilities which assist women and men to avail of employment, education and <Col N="1266" /> training opportunities. I would like to add that child care will be a priority in the National Development Plan and, as the Deputy may be aware, I am at present chairing a ministerial group on the child care issue.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged that there is an information deficit in relation to the level of supply of child care places and the level of current or future demand for child care services in each county. My Department has commissioned Area Development Management Limited to develop a national child care census and database which would provide information on child care provided in group settings on a county by county basis. The cost of the project is met through EU, and Exchequer funding.</P>
      <P>Data is being gathered at county level which will lead to the production of reports which will include maps and tables providing information on the types of facilities available, usage of child care services, staffing levels and the cost of such services. The intention is that these reports will facilitate analysis of future demand for services against population projections, etc. assisting the identification of gaps in service provision and the effective application of funding supports at regional and local levels.</P>
      <P>I understand that the data collection process in County Donegal is almost completed at this stage. It is aimed to have reports for all counties finalised by early next year.</P>

      <P>The existing legislation, section 7 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act 1925 [No. 7], already provides for the appointment of a surgeon for the Garda Síochána. The former acting Garda surgeon died suddenly last July and every effort has been made, in conjunction with the Garda authorities, to find a suitable replacement. Arrangements had been made to recruit an individual in August but it subsequently transpired that the individual in question was unable to take up the post. Efforts to find a replacement are continuing and I am hopeful that the Government will be in a position to appoint a surgeon within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that there are proposals to create a new post of a chief medical officer for the Garda Síochána who will effectively take over the duties of Garda surgeon in due course. I would hope to see this come to fruition early next year.</P>

      <P>Recommendation 1.3.10 of the Donegal task force initiative report sets out investment priorities, policies and strategies for the achievement of increased growth rates in overseas and domestic visitor numbers and tourism revenue in Donegal between 2000 and 2006.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that Donegal tourism is currently being promoted as never before. This includes Donegal's participation in the north-west RTA marketing programme, which is part of a new Bord Fáilte initiative to promote improved regional tourism spread. The introduction and promotion of the new Ryanair service from London to Derry offers exciting opportunities for improved access to Donegal and I have also requested Bord Fáilte and North West Tourism to work with Donegal Tourism and ensure that the most powerful message possible is promoted about Donegal in all relevant markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of balanced regional development is a key objective of national tourism policy. The Border region has received tourism support of the order of £130 million over the past five years from a range of programmes including the tourism OP, 1994-1999, the special support programme for peace and reconciliation and the International Fund for Ireland. The upcoming National Development Plan which will run up to 2006 will again make provision for support for the development of tourism.  Future tourism development strategy will be based on the needs of areas with regard to their state of development. The key national objective for tourism product development will be to provide an appropriate product base capable of supporting sustainable tourism development through enhancing or building up an interesting mix of tourism prod<Col N="1269" /> ucts, especially in developing and still underdeveloped tourist areas such as Donegal.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that County Donegal, in conjunction with other lesser-developed tourism areas, will continue to bring forward imaginative and integrated proposals to attract and sustain increased tourism business to the area. In this, the county can depend on the assistance of the North West Regional Tourism Association and Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In June this year I announced a major new stay in school initiative. This marks a significant departure from traditional policy in that funding will be granted to schools on the basis of plans which they will be helped to design themselves. The underlying objective of the initiative is to establish a direct link between schools experiencing serious retention problems and my Department, with a view to agreeing multi-annual programmes of action with clear targets, which <Col N="1272" /> will be matched with appropriate resources. The core point is that schools themselves need to take charge of tackling early school leaving and I will give them the supports they need to make an impact. My Department has appointed two national co-ordinators to co-ordinate the initiative and assist participating schools to formulate their retention plans and targets.</P>
      <P>Each participating school will prepare its plan based on the particular needs of the pupils and community that it serves. A key requirement of the plans will be that a school operates on a multi-agency basis and establishes cross-community links in delivering on its commitments. In this context, it will be open to a school to co-operate with local projects providing support services to its pupils. It would be open to a school receiving funding under the stay in school initiative, as part of its plan agreed with my Department, to make a portion of the additional resources which it receives available to a local project which is supporting the pupils of that school. Any arrangements of this nature would be entirely a matter for the participating school in question, subject to my Department agreeing this as part of the overall school plan.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated previously, educational institutions will play a full part in addressing the human resource aspects of the task force report, including recommendation 1.3.4..</P>
      <P>Letterkenny Institute of Technology has indicated that it is anxious to play its part in the implementation of the strategies proposed in this report. I understand that the institute is developing proposals on the basis of the recommendations contained in the report and my Department will give due attention to these proposals when they are received. Presumably, they will be included, if appropriate, in the annual programmes and budget submission from the Institute.</P>
      <P>The VEC provides a range of programmes in business, international teleservices, information technology, community care, child care and sport and recreation, allied with programmes for early school leavers, adults with literacy difficulties, and the VTOS programme for the unemployed. Childcare provision for VTOS, Youthreach and traveller participants has been provided in Buncrana and Letterkenny, and the adult literacy provision has been increased. It is intended that initiatives in the field of second chance education will be further expanded in the light of developments under the National Development Plan.</P>
