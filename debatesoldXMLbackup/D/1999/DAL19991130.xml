      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The total Estimate for my Department for 2000 is £36.391 million. This represents an increase of £4.158 on the 1999 Estimate.</P>
      <P>The main reason for this is an increase of £3.35 million &ndash; to £8 million &ndash; in the allocation for the Moriarty tribunal. The bulk of the legal costs from the tribunal are expected to arise during 2000, once the tribunal has completed its work. As a consequence, the full allocation for the tribunal in the 1999 Estimates is unlikely to be spent.</P>
      <P>The other major item reflected in the Estimate for my Department is the funding of the millennium celebrations, for which the Government has allocated an overall budget of £30 million over a two-year period. To date, the Government has approved expenditure on projects totalling £22.5 million, following recommendations by the National Millennium Committee. Expenditure during 1999 has been lower than estimated, mainly because there is a significant capital element involved. There is a longer lead time on capital projects and the millennium office is determined that grants will not be made until satisfactory progress has been made on such projects. It is therefore likely that the bulk of the capital expenditure will now arise during 2000. In summary, therefore, the main reason the forecast outturn of expenditure for 1999 is below the estimate is the lower than expected level of payments of millennium capital grants, and savings on the 1999 cost of the Moriarty tribunal; the main reasons for the difference between the 1999 projected outturn and the 2000 Estimate are the higher levels of expenditure projected for 2000 on millennium capital projects and on the Moriarty tribunal; the lower than expected outturn on capital expenditure in 1999 relates to the timing of millennium capital expenditure, as I have outlined, and the projected increase in capital expenditure for 2000 arises for the same reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> Regarding the provision for Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, I refer to my reply to the House on 25 May last, where I announced the allocation of more than £1.2 million in grants, under the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, for projects involving North-South and East-West co-operation or relating to the island of Ireland. This allocation fully exhausted the moneys available under the fund. I also circulated with my reply on that date a full list of 59 projects to receive funding. The process of disbursing the grants is ongoing and, this year to date, grants have been issued to 34 organisations.</P>
    <P>I am circulating with my reply a full list of those organisations which have, so far, drawn down funds. The provision which has been made under subhead C of my Department's Estimates relates to those organisations which have not yet drawn down their funds, but which are expected to do so during 2000. The allocation of funds between the years 1999 and 2000 was made on the basis of the best estimate of the requirements of the organisations in each year. It may be necessary, in the context of revised Estimates, to take account of any shortfall in the drawdown of funds in 1999 as compared with the estimate originally made.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, provision has been made under subhead D of my Department's Estimates to allow for the contingency of the forum having one or more meetings in 2000. However, I recall that in a previous reply in this regard, I said I believed that, in the context of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, it would be preferable to see the primary axis for future island-wide consultation being the joint parliamentary forum and the independent consultative forum, envisaged in paragraphs 18 and 19, respectively, of Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement. In that event, while it would be a matter for the chairperson and the participating parties, I would envisage a final concluding meeting of the forum.</P>
    <P>Regarding subhead G, the provision for the Information Society Commission of £557,000 will fund the commission's activities for the full year. The budget covers salaries for the commission secretariat of seven full-time staff and the director's part-time post, and general administration expenses such as office supplies, equipment and maintenance. It also covers further work on the many activities of the commission including awareness and educational activities, including media campaigns; participation in public events, seminars and conferences; further initiatives aimed at the business community; and ongoing market research to measure progress and to support the policy analysis work of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten questions have been taken together and I have three to put to the Taoiseach. Bodies have been entitled to, and have been allocated moneys under the Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act and presumably the committee to advise on the allocation of funds has been disbanded. If they have not been in a position to draw down their money or have been otherwise unable to avail of their allocation, will the Taoiseach indicate if he is favourably disposed to make any residues of money available to the Irish peace park in Messines, which requires further funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply the Taoiseach suggests, although he does not confirm, the desirability of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which contributed to the process that has culminated in the progress made to date, meeting for a closing session. If so, will that session, among other things, agree to publish the work that remains unpublished, especially the obstacles to reconciliation in the South? I believe that work is well advanced and it could be concluded. If a decision was made to conclude, it could be our contribution in the South. The forum should not simply fade away. <Col N="1141" /> Is the Taoiseach prepared to suggest to the chairperson that a final meeting or series of meetings &ndash; one would probably be sufficient &ndash; be convened and that we would formally close that chapter in our history?</P>
    <P>In respect of the allocation of money to the Information Society Commission, I want to raise the issue of Y2K and our preparedness for it. Does the Government, through this commission or any other body under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, intend to send to each household across the nation a checklist similar to those being issued in other countries of the things of which they should be aware regarding a possible crash of any domestic system over the weekend of the millennium? Is that work being contemplated; is that part of the allocation to the Information Society Commission; and will he make a statement on that matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the last question first, that matter was raised here at Taoiseach's Question Time some time ago and we had some discussion on it. I said I would bring it to the attention of the co-ordinating committee and I did so. That is the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>If the Deputy tables a question to the Minister for Finance, he will deal with the matter. They have put together all of the arrangements, as I understand it, in the various sectors. The Deputy should table a question. There is no point in me answering everybody's questions every day here.</P>
      <P>On the second question on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, yes, I agree with Deputy Quinn. There should be a final meeting at an appropriate time to formally sign off that committee, if that is what happens at that stage. The work which was not totally completed &ndash; there were a few reports which were not totally completed &ndash; should be done. All going well, we should do that during the next calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will look at the draw down for Messines. Some of the 59 agencies may not take up the money. I have not said that I would not give the Messines project funding. I just want them to organise and sign off the first phase of their work, make sure that the first phase of the work is properly dealt with and administered and make sure that it is left in somebody's care in an organised way before we move to the second phase. I fear that we might go through a few phases of this and in five or six years we will hear again that the place is falling apart or is overgrown. I am trying to establish that what is done is completely <Col N="1142" /> administered and finished before they look at the second phase. I am not against the second phase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the besetting sin of our people that we are very good at building things and poor enough at maintaining them? Even green areas in housing estates are laid out well the first day and then they are not maintained afterwards because adequate provision is not made. Would the Taoiseach agree, given that the President of Ireland, the Queen of the United Kingdom and the King of Belgium visited Messines, that there is a need to make provision for the ongoing maintenance of this park? If we were not willing to make that commitment, we should not have allowed the President to go there. It would be an affront not only to the memory of the 49,000 Irish people who died in the First World War but also to the dignity of the President if a place, the opening of which she participated in, is not properly maintained ten, 15 or 20 years from now. That is something which must be dealt with and decided upon and not simply left to endless bureaucratic exchanges between voluntary organisations and Departments.</P>

      <P>That is what I said. Unfortunately the site is not within our jurisdiction and there are other bodies who deal with the site. It is quite a complex area. Whether it is us or somebody else who must do it, I just want to get certainty on that. On a few occasions I have given allocations additional to what was required originally and I just want to see that the first part is properly signed off and maintained into the future before we begin the next phase.</P>

      <P>I have done so with the organisation to which we gave the money in the first place and the Office of Public Works has had some discussions with the people involved. It is just a question of how it is done. I supported the Messines project from the outset. I gave the original allocation, the second allocation and third allocation. I just want to see that the project is administered properly. We will ensure that is done, however it is to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the last question I put to the Taoiseach concerning preparedness for Y2K in domestic households. With all due respect, the Taoiseach did not really respond to my question in the spirit I would expect from him. The Department of Finance has established a national emergency committee whose title presumes that some difficulties are anticipated. As regards Y2K preparedness, the business sector has been well served by Forfás and other agencies, but many domestic situations could go wrong. We simply do not know. Given that today is 30 November, <Col N="1143" /> for the Taoiseach to suggest that I should table another parliamentary question is &ldquo;a little bit previous&rdquo;, to quote a favourite phrase of the late Brendan Corish. Will the Government, through the Information Society Commission, undertake a campaign of awareness thus enabling households to go through a check-list of items, including ordinary domestic appliances such as washing-machines? Such a check could avert the kind of problems that would cause strife for many people over a holiday period when repair services are not readily available. Will the Taoiseach indicate what domestic campaign, if any, is envisaged by the Information Society Commission or, alternatively, the body under the aegis of the Department of Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In answering the Deputy I did not mean to be short with him, if I was. The Information Society Commission is not involved in such a campaign but the co-ordinating committee and all the agencies working with the Minister for Finance have been looking at the issues. The emergency group in the Department is involved and personnel from State agencies will be involved in providing emergency cover on 1 January 2000. A suggestion was made concerning a circular to households. Seminars have already dealt with these issues but I do not know what was done about that idea. I will obtain the information for the Deputy but I do not want to answer on behalf of a committee which is still working on the matter. The committee has put an enormous effort into solving Y2K problems across the industrial spectrum as well as the wider public service sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make the following formal suggestion by way of a question to the Taoiseach? Would he not consider it appropriate that the bodies responsible under the aegis of Government Departments &ndash; whoever is uniquely placed to do so &ndash; would undertake an information campaign of some intensity to alert householders to the possible dangers of Y2K non-compliance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that I raised this matter with him in October? Subsequently, I sent him a copy of the leaflet that has been distributed to every household in New Zealand by the relevant authorities there. What happened to the leaflet I sent to the Taoiseach? Did he consider that it was a good idea or a bad one to send out such a circular? I am asking for his opinions, not those of some body he may have sent the leaflet to and whose response he may not have been able to check. What has been done about this suggestion, given that it was formally made by myself, as Leader of the Opposition, to <Col N="1144" /> the Taoiseach as a result of an exchange in the House at Question Time? It is now two and a half months since I made this suggestion, precisely along the lines that Deputy Quinn has now outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I clearly remember Deputy Bruton's correspondence. If he wants my honest view on that particular circular, I did not think much of it. I did not think it would attract a lot of interest. As the Deputy probably knows, there has been much controversy in the United Kingdom where people laughed at the circular that was distributed there. It was treated with derision. I do not think we need to do that. If the proposal is for a basic check-list, that was the proposal I put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may recall it was a very long, closely typed list. However, the concept of it is to assist people in their households, which I am not against. I put that to the committee that had been running the seminars on awareness. That committee has done fairly well, given our position a year ago. It may have done something on this. I do not chair or answer for that committee but I will ask it what it has done on the issue Deputy Bruton raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the sort of people who attend seminars probably do not need this information because they are, obviously, already conscious of the need to check these matters? It is the people who do not attend the seminars who need to be reached. Is it not the cumann members, so to speak, who need to be reached, not the average supporters. The problem is that they are not being reached by the current methods of communicating the impact of Y2K to individual households. Perhaps if the Taoiseach applied some the communication skills used in the political movements in which he is involved, he might realise that communications with the public on the hazards of Y2K are not the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, an enormous amount of preparatory work is being done. However, I do not think we should apply the American system, where I recently saw that people are buying ten days' worth of groceries <Col N="1145" /> and locking themselves away in case the world changes because of Y2K.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of giving basic information, which I will communicate to the committee. It has worked extremely hard on this and is taking it very seriously. It has organised staff for the night and co-ordination groups for all the essential services. I am sure it has looked at this but I will raise it with it. I do not want to force it to look at something it has probably already examined, but I will highlight the views of the House to it.</P>

This relates to the Taoiseach's Vote, not someone else's, and he should be able to explain why salaries in his Department will increase by 8 per cent when, under the partnership agreement, rates of pay are increasing by a smaller amount.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Since its inception the Information Society Commission has produced two annual reports and has published the results of a number of surveys which it organised. It has hosted a range of seminars on various topics related to the information society and participated in many events and functions to promote the benefits and opportunities of the digital age. As its past activities are well documented in the two annual reports, I will confine my reply to recent or current activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> Much of the work of the commission is of an ongoing nature in areas such as raising awareness and promoting the benefits of the information society. The commission's eight advisory groups continue to meet on a regular basis to discuss various aspects of developing the information society, and the work of these groups often gives rise to recommendations which then feed into the implementation process.</P>
    <P>In July, the commission published a major report entitled Building a Capacity for Change &ndash; Lifelong Learning in the Information Society. This report raises a number of issues and sets out recommendations on lifelong learning which is increasingly seen as vital in the ever changing world of the information society. Last month, the commission published the results of its latest survey on access to and use of technology among the general public. This survey shows that huge progress has been made in the past 12 months. It also shows that more needs to be done, particularly to avoid a two-tier information society, between those who have access and those who do not. The results of the commission's business community survey will be published next month. The commission recently published a discussion document on improving public access to the Internet for the population generally. I explained the purpose and content of this document to the House a few weeks ago. It is available either on the commission's website or directly from the commission secretariat. The commission also took part recently in an information event aimed specifically at the farming and rural organisations to explain the benefits of new technology, and a similar event for organisations which represent elderly people. Other targeted sessions like these are also being arranged.</P>
    <P>Last year the commission sponsored a television series called TechTV for RTE. The commission is currently examining options for a new TV series. The business awareness campaign which the commission is running with IBEC is continuing. This programme, which is part funded by the EU, involves a series of seminars around the country, with particular emphasis on small and medium sized companies. The most recent seminars were in Waterford on 21 October and Ennis on 24 November 1999. Questionnaires are given to the seminar participants and the feedback is very positive with most saying they will take action within six months as a result of the seminar.</P>
    <P>Turning to Netd@ys, from 13 to 21 November, the commission and the National Centre for Technology in Education organised the national Netd@ys initiative in Ireland. Eircom was the main sponsor for the initiative which sought to build on what, in previous years, was aimed exclusively at school children. This year the target was much broader and in addition to the hundreds of schools which took part, more than 200 public access points were set up around the country by chambers of commerce, libraries, Internet <Col N="1150" /> cafes, Eircom stores and IT centres. These all provided free Internet access and demonstrations for the public, and the schools also invited parents and the public generally to take part. Many businesses and public bodies also participated in Netd@ys, typically by arranging Internet access events for employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that information. How long will the Information Society Commission continue to operate in its present form? Is there a role for it on a semi-permanent basis, for at least a period of ten years? Is there a strategy that will enable every household to be linked in an electronic network which would make Government services directly available? Has the Government, as distinct from the Information Society Commission, a view on the final objective on becoming an information society in the truest sense of the word?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Information Society Commission is constantly evolving. It completed last year's agenda and this year's is very different. Ideas stem from every meeting and the commission will be around for some time. From the Government's perspective, the final objective must be that as many people as humanly possible should have access to the Internet, which is happening more quickly than people think. I am sure the Deputy has noticed that in shopping centres, people can access the Internet for ten minutes at the cost of £1. This facility is being used from morning to night. As I said recently, hopefully the cost of that will not increase because it came into existence as a facility which people could access easily. The Internet is being used in community centres, by sporting organisations and FÁS and ADM schemes. This should continue, and not only in a peripheral manner, full access should be provided.</P>
      <P>As regards the final outcome for Government, we are in a process of e-commerce and e-Government which will take time to complete. Committees are working on this under SMI and trying to drive it forward so all the information we have will be available. Some Departments are better than others and some agencies are outstanding while others are not so good. We need to reach a position where practically all information is available. The long-term unemployed and the disadvantaged are using technology in FÁS centres, where practically everything can be accessed by pushing a button. I saw this in operation recently, and it is great to see the young and the old using the system. If someone had put down a bet with me a few years ago &ndash; when the old card system was in operation &ndash;  that this would work, I would have lost. However, it is working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Information Society Commission and the Government are looking at how all households can be given access to the e-mail service. I also raised the issue of how to deal with the problem of junk mail to which Deputy Bruton recently referred. If we wish to be the leaders in this field, <Col N="1151" /> there are enormous opportunities to be grasped. I thank the technology companies for their participation and investment, whether in the IT 2000 programme in schools or whatever. This is continuing, and initiatives and processes which did not exist a few years ago, are now being looked at. The Information Society Commission is a very active group. It is anxious to continue with its work and we should enable it to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that reliability is essential if people are to be encouraged to use the service? Will he agree also that there is a problem with reliability in the phone system on which the Internet feeds, as witnessed during the recent collapse of that system in Dublin? Will he agree also, that people who use the service must not be ripped off? Is he aware that some people cannot log on to the Internet until the third or fourth attempt? These people end up paying for three or four calls rather than just one because of the failure to make an adequate connection initially. Will the Taoiseach agree that if we are to encourage Internet use, we must encourage reliability and transparency in regard to charges and independent regulation of charges so that users are not ripped off?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that reliability in the public and private sector is a key issue. The Eircom issue was a serious matter. Inquiries have taken place and I hope the problem will not arise very often as it would create many difficulties. If the Deputy has a particular issue in mind, I will bring it to the attention of the appropriate authorities. Obviously if the service is costing customers more than it should, there is a fault somewhere in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Perry has brought to my attention the fact that people are logging on three or four times before they actually establish a connection. These people end up paying for three or four calls rather than one. This can add up, particularly if more than one young person in a house is interested in using the Internet. Will the Taoiseach agree there is a serious risk of making the same mistake with the Internet as was made in regard to roads? We have encouraged people to own more road vehicles but we have not increased the capacity of the roads. Likewise, we may be encouraging more use of the Internet while the basic network is not adequate. Will the Taoiseach agree that, because of the fact that Eircom's future ownership and strategy is in doubt as a result of the withdrawal of its strategic partner, there is a question mark over the future development of this key element of our infrastructure? We could end up with a situation whereby Eircom is owned by some body with its headquarters in Palo Alto who will not be particularly concerned about the needs of Irish infrastructure. Therefore, we need to take steps to ensure there is an adequate strategic element <Col N="1152" /> inserted in any arrangement to guarantee there will be not be a detrimental effect on our infrastructure.</P>

It is obvious that if we provide the services we should also provide the infrastructure. That is being done and many resources have been invested in this area during the current year. The Tánaiste and I have already made announcements about such investments.</P>
      <P>I note Deputy Perry's remarks and I will ensure that the position is investigated.</P>

      <P>I should also have informed Deputy Quinn that, at the beginning of autumn when changes to the Government's action plan were announced, it was announced that £7 million would be invested in information society projects during the remainder of the year. These funds are being used in many areas where Government action is required to try to ensure that our initiatives proceed as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Sub-committee on Infrastructural Development and Public Private Partnership, which I chair, includes the Tánaiste, the Ministers for Finance, Public Enterprise, Environment and Local Government, Justice Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General. The general purpose of the committee is to oversee the delivery of key infrastructure in the context of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet sub-committee is assisted by a cross-departmental team drawn from those Departments. The terms of reference of the team are to develop and oversee the implementation of a framework for action and, in particular, to bring forward proposals to deal with planning approval issues to reduce delays in infrastructure delivery &ndash; these could include proposals for legislative and constitutional change; support development and implementation of public private partnerships and could support the ongoing work of the Cabinet committee.</P>
      <P>During the summer, the Team produced the &ldquo;Framework for Action on Infrastructural Development including Public Private Partnership&rdquo; which was approved by the Cabinet sub-committee in September and subsequently by the Government. The key elements of the framework have been included in the national development plan. I have arranged for copies of the framework for action to be laid before the House.</P>
      <P>Following the finalisation and publication of the national development plan, I see the Cabinet committee playing a key role in ensuring that the core national roads and public transport priorities of the plan are implemented efficiently and on time. To that end I am arranging for the committee to meet on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The committee had meetings with CIE and the National Roads Authority last week to discuss the two agencies' plans to ensure the timely delivery of the priority objectives in the national development plan. Both meetings were worthwhile and both agencies assured the Cabinet committee that they are putting in place the necessary internal procedures to ensure that the greatly increased expenditure provided for in the national development plan will result in the timely delivery of projects and services.</P>
      <P>To date, the Cabinet committee has met three times and the cross-departmental team has met ten times. The committee has not yet considered institutional reform to implement public private partnership projects, given that arrangements and structures to implement such projects have recently been put in place under the aegis of the Minister for Finance and are working well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe an amendment to the Constitution will be necessary to ensure that commitments made in the national development plan in respect of infrastructural development are fulfilled?</P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If necessary, that will be the case. The examination is nearing completion and we will be obliged to make a decision thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate the likely timeframe within which consideration of this issue will take place? Does he agree that prolonged uncertainty regarding whether a constitutional amendment should be introduced would be the worst of all possible outcomes in the sense that projects may be delayed in anticipation of its introduction or that efforts, which might be better devoted to other projects, may be invested in drawing up such an amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to await the report's completion before making a decision. However, the current view is that streamlining court arrangements, processing matters through the courts and putting in place a more co-ordinated system might be an adequate solution. I had believed that the position in other countries was different but, on examination, we discovered that it is not. The system used to process matters, the length of time taken to make preparations and the general administration of the courts all help to create enormous delays.</P>
      <P>We must take conclusive action and this might require the introduction of amendments to the Planning and Development Bill. The position is currently being considered in that regard. We are very conscious, however, that early decisions must be made on this issue and I hope they can be taken before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Cabinet sub-committee definitively identified specific projects that will be the subject of public private partnership initiatives? If so, will the Taoiseach provide details of those projects? Has a formal decision been made to request the Courts Commission to assign a special division of the High Court to expedite legal queries into infrastructural developments? Has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform been asked, under existing arrangements, to investigate whether the President of the High Court can assign a section of the court to deal with these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Taoiseach's meeting with the National Roads Authority tomorrow, is he aware we are not empowered legally to undertake a motorway project, for example, along the N4 from Dublin to Galway, which passes through five local authority areas, where the Executive decisions will involve only one public inquiry? Given that each county must be dealt with separately, five local authorities are involved. Is he further aware that this institutional hand trip exists in regard to holding a single inquiry for a single project so that it goes through due process and does not deny the rights of any person? Does the Cabinet sub-committee propose to amend the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, or, alternatively, the planning legislation <Col N="1155" /> currently before the Seanad to deal with this matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to PPP projects, we have identified roughly the areas where money should be allocated. Pilot projects are in place but we have not completed the full range of projects because of the many tendering and legal issues to be resolved. We have considered what happened in Portugal and in other countries which have been successful in this regard. We must follow tendering arrangements and there are many complexities in our law generally. We are examining how this can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no specific projects yet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Except the pilot projects that have been announced, some of which will commence next year. A total of £1.58 billion has been allocated to PPPs &ndash; £1 billion for roads, £300 million for public transport, £550 million for environmental projects. This is a minimum target and I do not envisage any problem with the pilot projects.</P>
      <P>With regard to the courts, we are moving towards the view that a single court is the way to proceed. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Courts Commission support that view and are examining how best to do that. The Deputy accurately described the problem with regard to motorway projects. Our advice is that legislation is required to overcome that. We have examined the case history of motorways, bypasses and roundabouts that have been constructed in the past ten to 15 years to reach a conclusion on this. Our advice is that one inquiry is needed but, more importantly, one legal team to deal with the project throughout the process. We hope to achieve that and we are advised that it can be done legislatively. The arrangement would be that we would adopt a super-motorway model to avoid indents along the way and one legal or administrative grouping would handle the entire operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the criticism of the weakness of PPP units in the Departments of Finance, the Environment and Local Government and Public Enterprise and the need to set up a new dynamic quasi-commercial directorate to manage PPP projects? International experience is that a commercial dynamic is needed to make it happen and whether it involves only designing and building or designing, building and operating in the case of transport projects, there is a need for a new structural approach. Has the sub-committee considered institutional reform in terms of setting up such a directorate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach envisage that Departments will be in a position to send out the various recommendations on PPPs to <Col N="1156" /> local authorities to ensure the development and operation of projects gets under way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information on the pilot projects is available from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I am sure it is being communicated because local authorities are involved in them. However, the Deputy can get the details from the Department of the Environment and Local Government if he wishes.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Yates's points, structures in other countries have been considered and there were detailed discussions with the NRA last week. The NRA has taken on a huge number of staff but, unfortunately, most of the consultancy in the financial, legal and technical framework will probably have to be brought in. The NRA is already considering that possibility and is making progress on it. A huge number of the projects will involve outside consultants.</P>
      <P>I am open to correction but I understand the first project which went to tender was the port tunnel. There are ten consortiums and while some of them include Irish involvement, most of the interest is from outside. Expertise from other countries is already involved. While the internal staff will deal with the administrative structure and the NRA's staff will also be involved, regrettably, the substantial element of professional expertise will come from outside the country.</P>

      <Quest> the proposals, if any, she has to tackle the skills shortages in view of the fact that a recent study has estimated that Ireland will need an additional 160,000 skilled workers over the next ten years; and if she will elaborate on the statement made in the past week regarding a quota system. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan is predicated on a continuation of strong labour force growth, albeit at a slower rate than in recent years. An annual average increase of about 2 per cent is forecast, which corresponds to an increase of about 250,000 in the labour force over the period of the plan. This is based on estimates of the natural increase in the labour force, augmented by higher labour force participation by women and the continuation of net immigration. These forecasts represent a reasonable assessment of likely future labour market developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment in the period ahead is expected to grow at an annual average rate of at least 2 per cent. Undoubtedly, with unemployment at record low levels and projected at this historically low <Col N="1157" /> level into the future, the labour market will remain very tight. The Government is pursuing a wide range of policies to ensure that the economy remains competitive and continues to grow in a sustainable and low inflationary way. In recent replies to the House, I described the broad range of initiatives taken to enhance labour supply and the skills of the current workforce. These include fiscal initiatives such as the introduction of tax credits and the removal of persons earning up to £100 from the tax net. Programmes aimed at systematically engaging with the unemployed and supporting them into employment are particularly significant in that regard. The response to skills bottlenecks is being pursued through the implementation of the recommendations proposed by the expert group.</P>
    <P>Facilitating women's participation in the labour market will further enhance our labour supply. As I indicated, we need to ensure that women who have been out of the labour force have a significant incentive to return to work and to do more to ensure that child care provision does not act as a constraint. The forthcoming budget will include significant initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>Immigration has been and will remain an important source of skills required to meet the needs of our growing economy. Irish people returning home and EEA nationals who do not require work permits constitute the bulk of our immigrants. This flow can be supplemented by an orderly intake of non-EEA nationals under a work visa regime which matches the intake of the identified skill needs of the economy. It is proposed to establish an inter-departmental group to consider such a scheme and following consultation with the social partners to report to Government by the end of February.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4 November the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment informed me that only 15 work permits had been issued to asylum seekers who were told they could seek work. Has she carried out an audit of the skills base among the 2,000 asylum seekers given that workers are needed in every sector? Has she carried out an audit to fill some of the skills gaps which exist? If not, why has that not been done?</P>
      <P>My next query will give us an idea of the number of work permits which have been issued since 4 November and I hope it is much more than 15. Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment clarify what the spokesperson from her Department meant when he said that a new system of visas for workers would be introduced by early spring? Will the Minister indicate how that can happen given that all she said earlier was that an interdepartmental committee would be established? Does she envisage that by the new year each embassy will be told there is a quota regarding the number of people who can come to Ireland without a job offer but with particular skills? How does she envisage the system working?</P>

      <P>Regarding the new immigration policy, there are enormous shortages in certain areas of the labour market which cannot be met from our own resources or by people coming to live in Ireland. An unprecedented number of work permits is being granted and the regime for the granting of such permits has been considerably liberalised. However, there is a need to do more. I am working with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on a new immigration policy for the Government which will effectively grant work visas to citizens living abroad to allow them to come to Ireland and access job opportunities.</P>
      <P>The reason it will take time to decide precisely how this will be done is that there is a need to assess and identify the relevant skills areas. There is also a need to talk to the social partners and I am not in favour of a country quota system. I do not want us to create a brain drain in developing countries. We need to tie the new work visas to particular skills and have an open policy with regard to countries. However, I am anxious to ensure that Central and Eastern European countries and some developing countries in addition to places further afield qualify under the immigration policy.</P>
      <P>Together with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I intend to put a working group in place. We have done a considerable amount of work on this matter since the summer when the decision on asylum seekers, which is a temporary arrangement, was made. There is a need to involve the social partners in relation to areas in which permits might be granted.</P>

      <P>Since the Government decision of 26 July last certain categories of asylum seekers have been allowed to seek employment in this country. A total of 2,100 asylum seekers immediately qualified to seek employment on this basis. To date a total of 90 applications have been received by my Department in respect of such asylum seekers, and a total of 53 permits have been approved.</P>
      <P>Once an application has been received in my Department in respect of an asylum seeker, it is immediately referred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to check if the person concerned is eligible under the terms of the Government decision of July last. If the person is eligible, then a permit is immediately issued. Priority is given to applications in respect of asylum seekers to ensure that they are dealt with quickly.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it is my intention to ask the Government to approve the removal of the requirement for an employer to obtain a work permit before employing asylum seekers. Listed eligible asylum seekers will be issued with a suitable identification letter which the employer can simply verify before offering employment.</P>

That employer must be willing to make application with a fee. It takes at least a month, if not longer, to process it. This is undermining the entire system. The 26 July Cabinet decision was described by the Minister in the House as an exceptional measure. For an exceptional measure to have delivered 90 applications some six months later is absurd.</P>

      <P>It was an exceptional measure because no other Government ever did it, or recognised that asylum seekers should have the right to seek employment. It was not an easy decision to arrive at. Notwithstanding that, it is four months in place. Clearly a number of problems have arisen. I anticipated that the numbers expressing interest would be much larger. Employers have told me that asylum seekers are afraid to give names in many cases because of what might happen if they do. The simplest thing is to give all those who qualify a letter. Then they can search for a job and be granted a permit. I hope the new system will confirm what I believe, that many of the people who are here are here in search of opportunity and, if given the chance, they will access that opportunity.</P>

Deputy Owen is shaking her head. No Minister has looked at the work permits legislation in the past 30 years. The same practice has been followed. That is why we are putting it on a statutory basis. The procedure at the moment is that an employer applies for a work permit in respect of someone to whom he wishes to give employment. To change that requires a Government decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 44 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>This Government attaches a high priority to creation of the conditions necessary for persons to seek and take up paid employment. A major focus of the Government is to improve the reward from work for those in employment, potential job recruits and the unemployed, and very significant progress has been made in the tax and social welfare areas on this front. The thrust of current policies are centred on fiscal initiatives, as well as removing other impediments to seeking and accepting a job.</P>
      <P>Recent measures include the introduction of tax credits and the removal of persons earning up to £100 from the tax net and structural changes in the calculation of the family income supplement which was enhanced to provide for the assessment of entitlement on the basis net pay, rather than gross pay.</P>
      <P>During this year a consultative group was established under the chairmanship of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to consider the complex issues raised, including the traps faced by particular unemployed cohorts arising from the loss of the supplementary welfare allowance rent and mortgage payments on their transition to employment. Discussions in this committee are ongoing with a view to devising solutions to the problems that arise for some categories of people who return to work.</P>
      <P>As regards the medical card, long-term unemployed persons are allowed to retain their medical cards for three years on their transition to work, a measure that has been in operation for some considerable time.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming budget will continue to build, as in recent budgets, on ways of assisting in the re-integration of the unemployed and persons outside the labour force into the open labour market by way of fiscal measures and by tackling disincentives to taking up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>With more than 170,000 people on the live register and advertisements for jobs in every sector of our economy, can the Minister give any explanation, other than that there are still impediments in the system, why people who are unemployed are not taking the opportunity to work? Would she agree there is a menu of impediments now in existence which prevents people from taking up jobs, including the loss of their rent allowances and help with mortgages, increased rent if they are in a county council <Col N="1162" /> house, the loss of medical card because it is not universal that people will keep their medical card, failure to qualify for third level education grants, changes in family income supplement payments, loss of fuel allowances, and so on? Will she give a commitment that she and the relevant Ministers will examine all these impediments to ensure that they are removed with a view to encouraging people back to work rather than continuing with the existing minimal system, given that we need these people to work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years I have held that the tax and welfare systems act as a disincentive to people to take up employment. That is why many of the reforms of Governments of every hue in recent years have helped in this regard. We need to go further. We are turning around the very anti-work tax system to make it pro-employment and reward people who take up work, work harder, and so on.</P>
      <P>The number of long-term unemployed people is now down to in the region of 40,000. There are particular difficulties. The success of the employment action plan is well known &ndash; 66 per cent of those cases in which we intervened are no longer on the live register. They are back at work, in education or in training. However, there is a core of people who do not have the basic skills to access any job. There is a high level of illiteracy, unfortunately some drug and substance abuse, and other personal problems. Some of the initiatives to be announced by the Minister for Finance tomorrow are aimed at tackling some of those problems, particularly in the area of training where we need to focus clearly on the needs of that cohort of people. Maybe the issues mentioned by Deputy Owen are clear factors. Everybody responds to the economics of their own situation. If it is not economic to return to work for whatever reason, people will not do so. Some of the things that will happen tomorrow will make it clear that we are seeking to assist people to return to work. It is hoped that will play its part in remedying some of the difficulties which have been highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the Minister's reply, will she again examine the changes she has made to the community employment schemes in order to ensure that the long-term unemployed who currently can work on a community employment scheme for three years can continue to do so if they cannot get into full-time employment, because it is better to pay people to work on a community employment scheme than to pay them to stay at home? That would be my ethic. There should be flexibility there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is interesting. Many of the people who opposed the community employment schemes some years ago are the very ones who are screaming at me now to keep these schemes going. It is a funny old world. It is a fact that the 19 hours a week suits many people's circum<Col N="1163" /> stances, and some of the incentives which were brought in to encourage people into community employment have worked. We need to learn from that and apply those incentives to the wider area. Additional tax allowances for children and adult dependants were introduced in the budget two years ago. They have helped, but the take-up has been very low. We need flexibility in community employment and the jobs initiative which I have extended for a further six months. There is a category of people who will perhaps never progress beyond CE or jobs initiative schemes and we must recognise that. I do not want to see people going back to being unemployed because that strips them of their dignity. The flexibility of which Deputy Owen speaks is something I wish to see maintained in the system.</P>

      <P>The national development plan recognises the importance of logistics to overall competitiveness and points out that the development of logistics as a key capability will be supported through the National Institute for Transport and Logistics.</P>
      <P>The National Institute for Transport and Logistics is an initiative of my Department to support companies in Ireland in achieving competitive advantage and to help Ireland become a major international centre of logistics excellence. The significance of our geographical location as a factor in the competitiveness of Irish business has long been recognised and has been frequently highlighted in recent times. The ability of Irish exporters to supply markets with increasingly demanding logistical requirements is, more and more, dependent on a greater level of transport expertise and skills.</P>
      <P>The NITL offers information, training and education programmes as well as facilitation and consultancy to manufacturing, process and service companies in Ireland. It also offers higher education programmes to school leavers in co-operation with the Dublin Institute of Technology to further increase the pool of skilled employees in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland has recently commissioned the NITL to carry out a study into the logistics capabilities and requirements of its client companies. The study will highlight logistical problems faced by companies throughout Ireland and identify the steps required to improve their competitiveness in this area. The study, which is due to be completed by July next, will also address <Col N="1164" /> the impact of e-commerce on the logistics requirements of the companies surveyed.</P>
    <P>The NITL is also currently collaborating with a FÁS-sponsored study on the labour supply and demand needs of the transport and logistics sector. This work will feed into the deliberations of the expert group on future skills needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of centralised distribution by the retail multiples with deliveries direct to a single location will lead to the by-passing of local distribution. The distributive trade is very staff intensive and employs up to 25,000 people. It is reckoned that the alteration in distribution methods will mean 40 per cent of multiple retail business will be done through central distribution. Is the Minister aware that as many as 5,000 jobs will be lost because of this?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the appointment of an independent facilitator to develop a co-operative strategy? Many companies are unaware of the far reaching implications of centralised distribution which will expand and is here to stay. There are more than 163 companies in the grocery supply and distribution chain and many of them will be affected. Some are unaware how to deal with the problem. Will the Minister appoint a facilitator to educate those companies in the technology necessary to combat the problems they will face?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised in the internal market and worldwide that there will be fewer jobs in distribution. Logistics relates to managing warehouses, inventories and so on. Many successful companies, such as Dell, do not hold stock in warehouses and have cut out middlemen because all their products are customised. These methods will bring enormous changes, particularly in an economy like ours where the scale of things is very small.</P>
      <P>If my Department can help to educate people about what is happening I would be delighted to have it do so, but the National Institute for Transport and Logistics which is supported by my Department and which I recently visited might be the most appropriate body to deal with companies in this area. Getting goods to the market more speedily than in the past is very important, particularly in an e-commerce market. Companies will have to deal with the enormous consequences of these developments. Unfortunately jobs will be sacrificed in some sectors to maintain them in others. That will be the reality in the distribution business in Ireland, in the EU and throughout the world. I will communicate with Deputy Perry regarding a suitable person from the institute who might talk to the companies in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 54, 89 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the third ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation which is taking place in Seattle from today, 30 November, until 3 December next will take the necessary decisions to launch a millennium round of trade negotiations across a broad range of trade issues. It is likely these negotiations will commence in 2000 and be completed within a specified timeframe. My departmental colleague, Deputy Kitt, as Minster of State with responsibility for trade, is representing Ireland at the ministerial conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's position on the new round has been developed in co-operation with our European <Col N="1166" /> Union partners, in keeping with our treaty obligations, and EU submissions have been made to the WTO outlining the European Union's view on the new round. The EU approach has been to call for a comprehensive round of trade negotiations involving a broad range of issues. It is our belief that this is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far reaching economic changes, to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, to promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
    <P>In addition to proposing a detailed agenda to ensure the needs of developing countries are concretely reflected in the negotiations, we feel the agenda for the new round should, among other things, include further liberalisation or rule making in the fields of agriculture and services, non-agricultural tariffs, investment, competition, intellectual property, e-commerce, trade facilitation, government procurement, technical barriers to trade, core labour standards and trade and environment. Results in all areas should support and contribute to sustainable development.</P>
    <P>Addressing the concerns of developing countries is a key strategy in the EU approach to the new round. Special and differential treatment for developing countries is already a cornerstone of existing WTO agreements and in the new round there is a need to examine how these provisions can be implemented or changed to have a better impact for developing countries. The traditional approach has been mainly to base special and differential treatment for developing countries on extended implementation periods. Other methods can be examined during the future negotiations.</P>
    <P>In addition to special and differential treatment, Ireland along with the EU will sponsor a call for duty and tariff-free market access for products from least developed countries to all markets by 2003. Capacity building, technical assistance and coherence between international bodies have also been identified by the EU as a contribution to the concerns of developing countries.</P>
    <P>Developing countries themselves are actively involved in addressing their particular concerns for the new round and considerable time has been spent on implementation issues in the discussions on the draft ministerial declaration. Given that the WTO operates by consensus, the approval of developing countries to any final arrangements will be essential before the negotiations can be successfully concluded.</P>
    <P>In addition to a decision to launch a new round of trade negotiations, we hope this ministerial conference will take decisions that will strengthen the WTO as an institution. These could include improvements to the dispute settlement understanding, the creation of an institutional basis to better address development concerns, the improvement of co-operation between the WTO and other major international institutions and <Col N="1167" /> improved procedures to create greater transparency and public awareness of the WTO.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that the Government representatives at the WTO round will not only support but advocate more involvement by the developing countries? Will he confirm that the Government will ask that the round stop unless there is agreement on assistance to the developing countries to be full trade partners with the rest of the world? The worry is that there might be one or two countries who are happy to do this but the pressure from other countries may be such that Ireland will go back on what it might put forward at the meeting. Will the Minister give a commitment that the needs of the developing countries in this round will be paramount in the Irish Government's proposals and that it will not support any proposals unless they include the developing countries?</P>

      <P>It is obvious from my response that Ireland fully supports the European Union's proposals and the measures we want implemented. We will advocate a much greater role for the developing countries and Irish Ministers, their advisers and the excellent officials who work with them will not be found wanting when it comes to putting down our markers and what we want to achieve. The question of whether we will ask for the round to be stopped will be a serious consideration. We do not have any indication that that will be necessary. We hope a consensus will emerge rather than that a negative attitude will prevail, involving world trade wars that might have a serious effect on world economic development and the globalisation of our economy, and thus curtail opportunities that may be available to us.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate the basis for his conviction after the Uruguay round that a millennium round or a further round of liberalisation will get under way? Is it not the case that, as we stand today, there is considerable doubt whether the agenda can be reconciled with a view to a new round being put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis for my conviction is very simple. The European Union is pushing strongly that the next round commence. We support that and hope it will commence. There are many issues to be discussed. The CAIRNS group of countries have particular issues relating to agriculture which affect Ireland. The United States have a similar instance and the G8 have another point of view. There is no doubt it will not be easy, but we are optimistic that commonsense will prevail and that the round will commence and ultimately reach a conclusion.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who is representing the Government at this round, been given any instruction to ask for a <Col N="1168" /> commitment to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the effect of the existing round of trade policy on developing countries? Is there any proposal that Ireland would ask for a food security box to support local production for domestic consumption because under the agricultural agreement there are grave imbalances for developing countries? Many of the organisations that have written to us on behalf of the developing countries have stressed that a number of the existing terms are unfair and unbalanced. Will there be an assessment of the development of the social impacts of the current trade system to ensure those same impacts cannot be built into the next round?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been necessary to give instructions to the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. A consensus had been reached as a result of decisions taken by Government. In discussions with the Tánaiste, officials in the Department, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and myself on one occasion a consensus has emerged on the attitude we should adopt. The Government took a decision recently to make £2 million available to provide technical professional assistance to the least developed countries so that they can have the necessary structures in place to assist them and ensure they get the best deal possible out of any future round of WTO negotiations.</P>

      <P>On a small point first, a Leas Cheann Comhairle, and with no disrespect to Ministers of State, Deputy Kitt and Deputy Treacy, is it the Tánaiste's intention to involve herself should these negotiations get under way? Will the Minister of State indicate if some Government Minister recently met a number of NGOs on this agenda and what specific measures the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is likely to pursue at Seattle that are in line with the representations made by the NGOs in respect of the developing countries?</P>

Within those parameters and the priorities for Ireland we will do our utmost to make a major impact at the negotiations. Ireland has often come up with proposals that have led to an emerging consensus. If necessary the Tánaiste would be prepared to lend her full support. However the Tánaiste, myself and the Government have the utmost confidence in the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to do a good job on behalf of Ireland.</P>

      <P>At the invitation of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, these 19 organisations came to meet him. They attended a seminar on the new round. The meeting allowed an opportunity for a broad range of interest groups to discuss with the Minister both Ireland's and the European Union's objectives for the round. These objectives and general priorities are to have a reduction in tariffs; ongoing negotiations on services to enhance market access; to conclude negotiations on agriculture and a review of the SPS agreement; the creation of a framework for multilateral rules for investment and competition; the development of rules on trade and environment; enhanced rules on electronic commerce trade facilitation and procurement; enhancing IPR protection under the TRIPS aspect of the WTO, which relates to copyright; greater participation in the integration of developing countries, particularly least developed countries and moves to improve transparency within the WTO. These items which were discussed by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and the NGOs will be given special attention at the conference and later, I hope, in the negotiations.</P>

      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest> her views on whether there is a need to establish an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards and, in the absence of effective non-statutory self regulation, to introduce a statutory system for handling complaints; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
      <QRef>[25135/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which reported in June 1996, was that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established. The commission was clear that this ombudsman should be appointed and funded by the newspaper industry, both indigenous and imported. <Col N="1170" /> The commission made the point that if the newspaper industry accepted this recommendation there should be a change in the law of libel to provide immunity from claims of defamation to the ombudsman.</P>
      <P>In November 1996 the then Minister presented an <i>aide memoire</i> to Government on the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry. Government decided that each Minister upon whose area of responsibility the recommendations impact should revert to Government in relation to any necessary legislation. Any change in the laws on defamation as recommended by the Commission on the Newspaper Industry is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I support the recommendation of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry regarding the establishment of an ombudsman and that it is for the newspaper industry to regulate itself in this regard. However, I have no departmental functions or responsibilities in relation to the law on defamation.</P>
      <P>I have no plans nor do I have any functions or responsibility to introduce a statutory system for dealing with complaints against newspapers.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the virus of the English tabloids has to some extent infected the situation in Ireland? Given this, does she accept the need for progress on this issue? In view of her reply, is it the case that she does not see any basis for progress except on a voluntary basis by the press? Does she regard the issue as being bogged down in the morass of libel law reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been some examples of matters appearing in publications which I would prefer not to see. People's private lives are their own affair, notwithstanding that they may be public persons. I hope everybody recognises that we must all carry out our job in a fair and responsible way and not interfere with people's privacy and that of their families.</P>
      <P>The establishment of an ombudsman, a press council or whatever should be on a voluntary basis. I strongly believe in self regulation. The commission on newspapers report suggested it be done on the basis of changes to the defamation laws. The Bill to reform these laws is at a very advanced stage and will be brought before the Government next year.</P>
      <P>However, I hope the newspaper industry will not wait for the legislation and that it might follow the example of other sectors, such as the insurance sector, and establish an ombudsperson, press council or whatever. That would have an important and useful role to play in resolving the complaints that are not satisfactorily dealt with otherwise. It would also perhaps avoid much unnecessary litigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister agrees <Col N="1171" /> with me on the need for an ombudsman. If the ombudsman was established on a non-statutory basis and seen to be operating properly would she agree that there would be a much greater atmosphere in which progress could be made on reform of the libel laws? Could both sides of the House suggest to the media that now is the time to proceed with the establishment of a press ombudsman on a non-statutory basis and, perhaps, go as far as the UK, where the press was given a certain amount of time to establish a press complaints commission? It was suggested there that if such a move was not made statutory action would need to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome the establishment of an ombudsman or press council. Many matters which end up in litigation could be avoided if people felt they had a fair way of making a complaint and having it resolved in such a way where, for example, the resolution gets the same kind of headlines as the original story. That is always a bone of contention. Everybody involved in public life will have reason to have grievances with the media from time to time. At times we are super sensitive, but sometimes there may be a justifiable reason for our concern. An ombudsman or press council would go a long way to resolve some of the difficulties that arise for citizens generally. That would be a very good development and I urge the industry to seriously consider it.</P>

      <P>Many newspapers have a provision for letters to the editor and some have correction columns and so on. Ultimately if that does not work the fall-back is litigation. A press council or ombudsman would have a useful role to play in satisfying the needs of the consumers of the media. When Deputy Rabbitte writes political articles I would like to have the opportunity to appeal to an ombudsman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Following the decision by both shareholders to seek to sell 100 per cent of Irish Fertilizer Industries, two indicative offers were received. However, both the State and the other shareholder, ICI, were of the view that neither offer presented a sufficiently strong basis for proceeding further with the joint sale process. Subsequently, several other parties expressed a possible interest in the purchase of IFI but no further indicative offers were received.</P>
      <P>Issues regarding both NET and IFI are under active consideration at present and I intend to raise the matter at Government very shortly. However, it is most likely that the State will retain its shareholding in IFI, at least in the short-term, until a recovery in the current difficult conditions of the fertilizer market would make a sale more likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm again when the two offers she referred to were made? Does her Department keep the workers and management appraised of the position and, if not, does she agree that perhaps they should be kept appraised of efforts made to sell the State's interest? When dealing with the various interested companies, does she seek an assurance on the continued manufacturing of fertilizer and would she include conditions in the sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have kept the workers informed. I met them and gave an undertaking that I would meet them again if there were any developments. Unfortunately, there have been no developments &ndash; certainly none I could recommend to the Government. We will not give this company away.</P>
      <P>The State's involvement in IFI and NET since 1987 has cost approximately £400 million. The favourable gas deal expires next January and some of the environmental standards that will have to be met will, unfortunately, pose further difficulties for the company. ICI first wanted to sell its share and the Government had first refusal, but it did not wish to acquire the shareholding. We sought to sell 100 per cent together, but that was not to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be the intention to maintain employment as far as possible, and certainly to maintain <Col N="1173" /> it at all three facilities, although I do not know if that could happen. It is what I sought to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion this matter was raised did the Tánaiste not advise that other than the two main offerers, interest was expressed by others? Has that come to nought or was it such that she considered there was no point in proceeding with it? If in the interim she is resigned to market forces being unable to provide an adequate prospective purchaser what is her advice on the trading position of these companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be further difficulties because of the change in the gas pricing arrangement from next January. Given the need to meet the climate abatement policy and so on, there will be environmental implications which will entail further costs for the company. I hope the fertilizer market will improve to the point where it will be more lucrative.</P>
      <P>Two formalised bids were made and there were also huge expressions of interest, which came to nothing. They did not go much further than talks with IBI, the company handling the matter for the Government, and requests for a prospectus. Offers were not made. Only two companies made an offer but I could not recommend them to the Government, nor would the House seriously expect me, on behalf of the taxpayers, to accept them. The company will remain under the control of the State and ICI until market conditions change. There are implications for ICI with regard to its undertakings for the company.</P>

      <P>With regard to the future of IFI, is the Tánaiste aware of a number of accidents that recently occurred in Marino Point in Cork? Will the State continue to invest in these ageing plants to ensure that they are safe? Are they Y2K compliant and, if not, are contingency plans in place to ensure that a major catastrophe does not occur at the turn of the millennium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it would not be my intention to go to Government to seek to invest more money in IFI. I assume the company is Y2K compliant. I believe it is. All State companies have been involved in an active programme, under the auspices of the Minister for Finance, to ensure that all State activities comply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. The main area where it has an effect is regarding environmental matters and in the future expenditure would be required on those matters.</P>
      <P>Obviously ICI has a major shareholding in this company. It is not solely in State ownership. Given what this endeavour has cost over the past 12 years, nobody could seriously expect the State to do that. To put it into perspective, one must realise what £400 million could achieve even today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 79 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The last five years have been very successful with regard to the attraction of overseas investment. Total full-time employment in overseas owned manufacturing and internationally traded services companies has risen from just over 100,000 in 1993 to almost 139,000 by 1998, a rise of 39 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities. The development agencies are now strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. Much of this investment has come from very large projects and these tend to strongly favour urban locations. Over the past year, IDA Ireland has restructured its regional offices in order to intensify the emphasis on securing sustainable growth and employment in the regions. The agency aims, over the period 2000-2, to deliver over 50 per cent of jobs created from new greenfield projects to the Objective One region which compares to 25 per cent at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the new EU State aids regime that will operate from 1 January next will favour new investment into the regions. Ireland will be divided into two basic regions &ndash; an Objective One region, consisting of the Border, midland and west regions and an Objective One in transition region, which will consist of the rest of the country. This will mean that the incentives the <Col N="1175" /> development agencies will be able to offer in the Objective One region will be substantially greater than those which they will be able to offer in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The recently announced national development plan will also help to underpin IDA Ireland's regional strategy since it will provide the infrastructure necessary for the attraction of overseas investment currently lacking outside the major urban centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

      <P>Will the Tánaiste comment on the alleged restructuring of the IDA, which involved the downgrading of the midland office of the IDA to a sub-office of the western region? What has the Tánaiste or the IDA done to encourage new industry to locate in the towns of Longford and Roscommon and the Minister of State's town, Ballinasloe, which has not seen a new industry for 25 years? Would the Tánaiste agree that the new industries will be located in the new growth centres in the BMW region and counties like Longford and Roscommon will be bypassed, as has already been the case with the extensions to the gas and telecommunications networks?</P>

First, the job of IDA Ireland is to sell Ireland abroad and the main focus of its work is in overseas markets, seeking to attract foreign investors to establish facilities in Ireland or to expand existing facilities. The new policy, since this Government took office, is to encourage those companies to opt for smaller projects in regional locations. It is not always possible to get very large job projects for smaller regional locations.</P>
      <P>Almost 80 per cent of the new jobs announced since the Government took office have been for outside the Dublin area. Recently IDA Ireland took its executives to see all of the facilities not just in the Objective One region but in places in Kerry, Cork and many other locations which we want to promote. I believe the new policy will be successful. With regard to specific counties, I have had a number of meetings with companies. As the Deputy will probably be aware, we announced recently a new food project for Longford involving an indigenous company. Longford and Roscommon are certainly on the list of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballinasloe, which is not only the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy's home town but is also my home town &ndash; I was only born in one place &ndash; remains top of my priority list. I have not given up that we will find that the new industrial park, Creath, which has recently been completed, will act as a major attraction. In some of these areas there must be attractive facilities if one is to get <Col N="1176" /> projects. People will not come to greenfield sites unless there are facilities.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to resume the Second Stage debate on this Bill. As I said in my opening remarks on 10 November, this is a crucially important Bill. Its purpose is to streamline and strengthen existing controls. It is directed at reassuring consumers regarding the safety of Irish beef and, in so doing, will also strengthen the commercial trading infrastructure for the beef sector as a whole. It is, in effect, a landmark Bill.</P>
      <P>Beef is a multi-million pound industry which makes a substantial contribution to the economy. In 1998, for example, output from primary beef production, excluding direct payments, amounted to £1.1 billion, or just over 2 per cent of GNP. There are approximately 130,000 farmers engaged in beef production in Ireland and beef is the major enterprise in some 90,000 of these holdings. In addition, some 10,000 persons are employed in the processing sector and in associated industries at livestock marts, the butchering trade etc.</P>
      <P>The maintenance and development of a strong, vibrant beef industry has been a matter of concern for all Governments over the years. At the beginning of 1996, the beef industry was in a strong position. Irish beef was commanding prices close to 90% of the EU price through the establishment of a strong presence on the higher margin European markets and reduced reliance on the lower margin third country markets. Confidence in the future of the industry was at a high. The advent of the BSE crisis in March 1996 changed all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although Ireland has only a low and sporadic level of BSE cases, exports to EU and third country markets plummeted and some countries <Col N="1185" /> banned imports of Irish beef altogether. The prices realised by Irish beef producers fell to their lowest level in the EU and, equally important, the confidence of customers and consumers of Irish beef was seriously undermined. The crisis affected not only Irish beef, but the EU beef market as a whole. Urgent action was required and a number of initiatives were adopted at EU and national levels.</P>
    <P>At EU level, the Commission reorganised and expanded its control and inspection services in the food, veterinary and plant health sectors. These functions are, of course, now the responsibility of Ireland's Mr. David Byrne, the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection. The Commission also established a number of scientific and advisory committees to assist it in the formulation of policies in this area. In addition, a rapid food alert system was put in place to provide early warning of food safety alerts. The overhaul of this system in the wake of the recent Belgium dioxin scare is one of the priorities for the new Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection.</P>
    <P>At national level, the Government established the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which is charged with protecting consumer health by ensuring that food produced in the State meets the highest standards of food hygiene and safety. One of the functions of the FSAI is to develop and co-ordinate an efficient food safety inspection service across the entire food chain to ensure consumer health is protected. For this purpose, the FSAI has concluded service contracts with a number of agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, for the delivery of food safety services in their areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>More specifically in relation to the beef sector, the regulations on animal identification and movements were strengthened. At national level, there was a commitment in Partnership 2000 to develop a national beef assurance scheme to promote the safety of Irish beef, a central element of which would be the provision of a comprehensive animal identification and tracing system.</P>
    <P>While the situation for Irish beef has improved considerably since mid-1996, and while many markets which had been closed to us have been reopened, a number remain closed or partially closed to Irish beef. There has also been a high level of renationalisation within the major EU markets. In addition, the climate for food production has changed dramatically. The protection of human health is now paramount and the provision of a high level of public health protection has become a central focus for all governments. It is now fully accepted that the maintenance and improvement of market position is dependent on meeting consumers' requirements, particularly in relation to food safety.</P>
    <P>It is against this backdrop that the Government approved the text of a Bill which places the national beef assurance scheme on a statutory footing. The Bill is clear evidence of the Govern-ment's continuing commitment to ensuring the <Col N="1186" /> highest standards of food safety, starting with the very important beef sector. The Bill is also an important element in the overall strategy for the future of the beef industry set out in the recently published report of the beef task force.</P>
    <P>The details of the scheme have been discussed extensively with the representatives of the main participants in it &ndash; farmers, abattoirs, meat plants, marts, the animal feeding stuffs trade etc. There is widespread support for the introduction of the scheme, albeit some concerns have been expressed, mainly in relation to its scope and the cost of compliance with it.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a national beef assurance scheme, the purpose of which is the development of common standards for the production, processing and trade in Irish cattle and beef for human consumption and the manufacture and trade of feeding stuffs; the application of these standards through a system of registration, inspection and approval; and the enhancement of an animal identification and traceability system for Irish cattle.</P>
    <P>The Bill applies to all persons engaged in the primary production and processing of Irish cattle and beef, that is, farmers engaged in cattle and beef production, cattle dealers, exporters of live cattle, livestock marts, slaughtering premises and establishments which otherwise process beef and establishments which manufacture or trade feeding stuffs. Some concern has been expressed regarding the apparent non-application of the scheme to the retail sector. The position is that the Bill needs to be read with existing legislation on food hygiene covering the retail sector. The European Communities (Hygiene of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1998 (SI No. 80 of 1998) and the European Communities (Official Control of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1998 (SI No. 85 of 1998) set out the detailed standards and controls for retail food businesses. These regulations are enforced by the health boards, which have also concluded service contracts with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, and which are responsible for the delivery of food safety for this sector. The regulations just cited set out detailed standards for these businesses, covering the full gamut of their operations, and provide enforcement officers with powers of seizure, detention, withdrawal of product, and the suspension, closure and prosecution of businesses.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the Government considers that to include this sector in the registration, inspection and approval system under the national beef assurance scheme would constitute a duplication of valuable resources and the introduction of a two tier anomalous system of control. It would be contrary to the regulatory reform package adopted by the Government, which seeks to simplify the regulatory framework for businesses.</P>
    <P>However, by regulating primary production and processing, the scheme will regulate the sources of supply for such businesses. In addition, <Col N="1187" /> under the scheme they will be obliged to source their supplies only from participants who are approved, and non-compliance with this provision will constitute an offence for which rigorous penalties are provided. Furthermore, provision has been made for the appointment of officials of the health boards as authorised officers to check whether this provision is being complied with. I am satisfied that the combination of the food hygiene regulations and the national beef assurance scheme will ensure the entire food chain is encompassed in regard to the production, processing and sale of Irish beef and cattle.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that only persons meeting the prescribed standards set out in its Second Schedule for the various categories of participants will be approved to participate in the cattle, beef and feeding stuffs industry. The standards in question are already contained in existing legislation for the most part and cover such matters as animal identification, animal health, animal remedies, animal feed, hygiene and hygiene practices, production and manufacturing practices, construction, maintenance and operation of premises and the environment, including pollution and waste control. There is, however, provision for the making of regulations where gaps have been identified in existing legislation, for example, in relation to the possession of, or tampering with, cattle ear tags and identity cards and the documentation of certain operational procedures in meat plants. Accordingly, while the Bill will tighten up the implementation of existing provisions, it will not impose any undue new legislative burden on participants.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a mandatory application, inspection, approval and registration process for all participants, the purpose of which is to provide independently-backed assurances about the safety of Irish beef. As it will take some time to complete the inspection process, there is provision for transitional arrangements under which all participants will be deemed to be provisionally approved until they have been either granted or refused approval under the scheme. All participants will be formally inspected and the arrangements for the inspections are being agreed with the various representative organisations. Agreement has been reached with all the parties concerned except the farming organisations. The proposal is that the inspection of farms will be carried out as part of the annual disease test on all herds. Discussions are continuing on this point and it is hoped the matter will be agreed in the near future. I stress that nothing in the Bill will prejudice the outcome of these discussions.</P>
    <P>Participants who are found to be in compliance with the requirements of the scheme will be issued with formal approval and will be entered in the register of approved participants. The period of validity of the approval will be open-ended, although there is provision to set a fixed period of validity for all or some categories of participants, <Col N="1188" /> should this prove necessary in the future. Approved participants will be subject to ongoing monitoring to ensure continued compliance with the scheme and there is provision for the making of regulations setting out the procedures for such re-inspections. Details of the re-inspection procedures will be agreed with the various representative organisations.</P>
    <P>Participants who are found not to be in compliance with the scheme will be informed of the action they must take to bring themselves into compliance and will be given a reasonable amount of time to do this. However, if they fail to take the necessary action they will be informed that their application for approval is being refused or revoked. Participants will have an opportunity to make representations against such decisions and the matter may also be appealed to the Circuit Court in the event of the refusal or revocation proceeding. The final sanction is that participants who have not been granted approval or who lose their approval status will not be allowed to trade in cattle, beef or feedstuffs. It must be stressed that these provisions do not introduce a licensing system to produce beef, but rather seek to ensure all cattle and beef produced for human consumption in Ireland comply with the statutory requirements and are safe to eat.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism that the level of the penalties provided for in the Bill are draconian. I stress the penalties provided for are the maximum applicable and it does not follow that maximum fines will be levied in all prosecution cases. This is a matter for the courts who have a duty to ensure the principle of proportionality &ndash; that the punishment fits the crime &ndash; is observed. The Department does not enter into legal proceedings lightly and I assure the House that prosecution of offences will be undertaken only when all other remedial options have failed. However, it is essential to have strong deterrents in the Bill to deal firmly with the very small percentage of persons engaged in criminal activity in the sector.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive system for animal identification already exists for Irish cattle, including bovine tagging and cattle identity cards. In 1997, work commenced on a major enhancement of the animal identification system with a view to incorporating data on all animal movements, as required by EU law. This system is known as the cattle movement monitoring system and involves the use of electronic means to capture data on animal movements through computer links established at livestock marts, meat processing plants and export points. A paper notification system is used to record movements where electronic means are not feasible. Implementation of this system is well advanced and, when fully operational, will provide for verification of the origin, identity and life history of bovine animals before they enter the human foodchain. The system is already in operation in relation to private sales from farm to farm and in more than 90 per cent of livestock marts, with the remaining marts coming on board at an early date. The system is also <Col N="1189" /> being rolled out to export approved meat plants with 80 per cent operational to date. It was introduced at local authority abattoirs on 27 September and piloted at live export points last month. To date, 2.2 million animal movements have been recorded on the system. With the co-operation of all parties, it is expected the system will be fully in place by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the requirement for relevant participants required to notify the movement of all animals on to or off their holdings or premises will be reinforced. There is also provision for the making of regulations setting out the form and time of the notifications, and the procedures for the use of the CMMS database to identify and trace animals slaughtered for human consumption. The inclusion of CMMS provisions in the Bill is necessary to provide the requisite legal powers to ensure participants comply with the requirements regarding the notification of animal movements, and that animals whose origins and life histories cannot be verified can be barred from entering the human foodchain.</P>
    <P>The national beef assurance scheme is a comprehensive and far-reaching scheme which demonstrates the commitment of the Government to underpinning the beef sector and I am glad to note the Bill has the overall support of the industry. I accept there are a number of outstanding issues still to be finalised, including the arrangements for the inspection of farms, and these will be attended to in full consultation with the relevant industry partners.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Bill is unduly restrictive and that it will impose an additional burden and cost, particularly on farmers, without delivering any tangible benefits. This is not the case. The standards farmers are expected to meet are already largely contained in existing legislation. As to costs, the vast bulk of producers already comply with the relevant legislation and any additional costs will be minimal. The position is that the environment in which beef is now being marketed has changed radically. We have to provide independently-backed guarantees that Irish beef is safe if we are to remain competitive and maintain or increase our market share. Of necessity this will impose some extra obligations on all elements of the beef sector. However, we have sought to keep these to a minimum while still delivering a credible scheme which will address the very real concerns of consumers and customers of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>One of the main aims of the Bill is to ensure the origin and history of all cattle and beef entering the human foodchain can be verified. This is a mammoth task which involves recording details of all the events in the life of the national herd, together with tracking the millions of cattle movements each year. The system that has been set up in meat plants, livestock marts, and so on, will ensure this can be done. The obligations imposed on the retail sector under the Bill, together with the legislative provisions already in operation for this sector, will provide guarantees <Col N="1190" /> on the safety of beef right across the foodchain. The national beef assurance scheme is comprehensive and credible and will deliver the additional assurances which will enable us to say that beef and beef products produced in Ireland are safe and wholesome to eat. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle, Fine Gael welcomes this Bill but I am concerned about some matters which I hope will be debated on Committee Stage. Irrespective of how the Minister may phrase it, Irish farmers will farm under licence for the first time from now on. However, I support the Bill as it will reassure customers about the safety of Irish beef and, in so doing, will assist the commercial trading of a product which is so important to Irish farmers.</P>
      <P>The beef industry is going through a terrible time and, unfortunately, there is little profit in beef farming. Through no fault of the Minister or anyone else, this is a bad time to introduce a beef assurance scheme. The Minister will know we are introducing this Bill at a time when the industry is doing very poorly. There has been some recovery from the BSE debacle of 1996 but the scars of that horrible period are to be seen all over the country. We are finding it exceedingly difficult to reclaim market share, particularly on continental markets, and this is one of the reasons I wholeheartedly support the Bill. We are finding it very difficult to convince continental consumers of the quality of Irish beef and that is why the measures included in the Bill will be of immense help from a marketing point of view.</P>
      <P>It is important for an exporting nation such as Ireland to be able to stand over its products and we must do so in a professional manner. I hope the Bill will be one of the best marketing tools available to us internationally. Having said that, I do not like some aspects of this Bill which I will outline in greater detail later.</P>
      <P>The success of the National Beef Assurance Scheme will be measured on whether farmers will eventually get more for their produce. There has been a great deal of hype about this overarching legislation and the 140,000 beef farmers have already been promised much of what is contained in the Bill. However, once it is put into law it will be a different kettle of fish. This will inflict endless bureaucracy on them and they can only hope they will be rewarded financially. The worst case scenario will be if, after the introduction of this scheme, the prices Irish farmers receive continue to fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be opportunities for niche marketing and, hopefully, we will be able to dramatically change our breeding policy so our product will be desirable worldwide. As I have said on many occasions, we will have to produce seven or eight different kinds of animal for seven or eight different markets. We are not used to this. However, if we are to be successful, it is what we must do. It will mean that a buyer of Irish meat or live cattle will be in a position to check with the Department <Col N="1191" /> of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development that an animal was reared under certain environmental conditions, on a certain farm at a certain time. This traceability is very important. The criteria will be that the conditions were environmentally friendly; the animal was well looked after and that if it had to be injected &ndash; as often happens &ndash; that will be noted and the proper withdrawal period adhered to; and that the overall environment for feeding and breeding will be in keeping with market requirements. If we are able to pull this off, it will be important for the image of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>If, after the imposition of a costly scheme on the beef industry, we do not achieve what we hope, we will have major problems. At this point the profitability of beef farming is so small that I do not know how many acres a farmer would need to have to make a decent living. The financial package of Agenda 2000 trumpeted by the Minister may pale into insignificance if farmers have to take the proposed intervention price of as low as 50p per pound. If that day comes, there will be serious trouble. I hope it will not and the introduction of this scheme will keep our beef price at a level which will not require intervention. If intervention is introduced under Agenda 2000, we will be rearing and selling cattle at below their value and the cheques in the post will not make much difference. If we are unable to obtain a premium payment on our beef world wide &ndash; hopefully the National Beef Assurance Scheme will assist in that promotion &ndash; and the base price is reduced to intervention level, we will have a huge problem in getting farmers to participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the performance of Irish EU Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, in a number of interviews. I support the proposal for a European super food health authority. It is important in the context of a food scare or a debate arising on the quality of a particular food that an independent authority above sectional reproach would have access to the most up-to-date veterinary and scientific information available. If this is what the Commissioner has in mind and if he can get the agreement of EU members, it will be a step in the right direction. As we know from the food scares which damaged us so much, it is not enough for one Government to give its agreement. The National Food Safety Authority is doing excellent work. However, we should have an authority modelled on the American body. I hope the Commissioner gets agreement on what I understand his proposal to be &ndash; if I am correct, I support him.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the work of the National Food Safety Authority and some of its pronouncements are sensible. The population is beginning to acknowledge and accept that it is a truly independent body with a modern scientific and professional approach whose views can be trusted &ndash; which is important in this business. We not only produce beef but we eat it also. I will <Col N="1192" /> never forget the BSE scare, yet three years later we are eating the same type of beef, from the same cattle, bred on the same land and it is totally acceptable. If it is acceptable now it should have been acceptable then. However, people, including me, were genuinely scared because we did not know enough about it. It is important to have a trustworthy food safety authority which overrides those fears and does not have a sectional interest. I highly commend the work of Dr. Patrick Wall and his staff. I hope they will continue in the same vein.</P>
    <P>The national beef assurance scheme brings together many facets of the beef industry. One of the most intriguing and difficult problems is to have a foolproof system of traceability based on the eartags of the animals. There are almost eight million cattle in the country. With the cattle movement monitoring system, theoretically it should be possible to know where every animal is at a given moment. This is the aim of the Department. It will be a remarkable achievement if we can implement it. The Minister said 2.2 million cattle are already registered on the system. I have seen smaller scale efforts fail or be changed a few years later. I hope it will not find out in two years that something was wrong with the computer database or the eartags and that the entire system will have to be overhauled. I speak for every farmer in the country who does not want that to happen, although I believe it will not happen.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed is mind-boggling &ndash; a farmer brings an animal to a mart in Ballinasloe and before it leaves the yard, the eartag number is with the DVO in Galway. We will know who sold the animal, who bought it and where he or she is from. This is absolute traceability and I hope it will work. It is important if we are to have any credibility. About 90 per cent of all livestock marts, as well as the processing industry, are involved in the scheme, and I hope that will be 100 per cent before long. I hope there will be no change, that the scheme has been scientifically and mechanically thought out and it will stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of flaws in the Bill. No matter how one looks at this Bill, it means farmers must have a permit to farm. There will be an on-farm inspection. If farmers do not pass the inspection, their herd numbers will be taken away. This will restrict their ability to farm. I do not know why the Minister has gone to such lengths to say this is not a permit. It looks like one to me and I am sure it will look like one to farmers.</P>
    <P>Huge costs will be involved if care is not taken with the inspection process. I am not sure if the type of agreement to which the Minister referred is in place. I hope it is because I would not wish the scheme to fail. The inspection should be carried out on the day the veterinary surgeon visits the farm to carry out the TB and brucellosis tests. The Minister stated this in his speech, but I have heard reports that this will not happen. Some vet<Col N="1193" /> erinary surgeons claim it merits more attention and that they must receive more information before visiting the farm, otherwise they would have to visit the farm a second time. I have not heard what this will cost. Given that farmers must carry out a TB and brucellosis test each year, it is only right and fair that farmers should not have to pay for this veterinary inspection. If the veterinary surgeon is on the farm eight to ten times each year, he will be aware of the farmer's capabilities and the health status of the herd. What is being proposed in relation to dairy farms seems to make more sense. Some veterinary surgeons look for dairy records and sale counts before they visit the farm. It is important to stress that the scheme should not be a money-making activity for the veterinary profession. I hope the Minister will give an indication of his thoughts in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I want this scheme to form part of an integrated approach under the cross-compliance scheme being introduced by Brussels. Under this scheme, more farm inspections will take place and those who do not pass the inspections will lose their headage and REPS payments. It is important, given the scheme being introduced by Brussels over the next few years and the national beef assurance scheme, that we do not create a police State with employees of the Department going all over the country. Nowadays there are inspections for REPS, headage payments and so on. Cross-compliance inspections will mean additional inspections to find out if farms are environmentally friendly. It seems we are facing an era of inspections. I hope strict criteria will be put in place for these inspections. Farmers must be treated with dignity, particularly elderly farmers who are finding it extremely difficult to keep up with the pace of change. Younger farmers are also finding it very difficult.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that an educational programme should be organised during the winter. The Department has arranged such programmes with Teagasc and the farming organisations on a number of previous occasions. Officials of the Department, Teagasc, the IFA, the ICMSA and so on should become involved in these programmes in towns throughout the country between now and next May. It will take a lot of time and effort to explain the changes to farmers. I make no secret of the fact that I find it difficult to comprehend all the changes, given the speed with which they take place. I cannot accept that ordinary farmers will readily understand these changes. This is why the run-in time to which the Minister referred is very important. I do not want farmers to lose a year's income as a result of a small error.</P>
    <P>The Bill is somewhat negative in that it places huge financial and psychological burdens on farmers, while the load is not shared equally among other participants. For example, the same traceability procedures will not apply to imported meat or meat products. This will place an enormous anti-competitive burden on producers in <Col N="1194" /> this country. In other words, the safety net now being applied to Irish producers will not cover outside producers to the same degree. Another negative aspect of the Bill is that the Government believes that by regulating primary production and processing the scheme it will regulate the sources of supply for such businesses. In addition, under the scheme participants will be obliged to source their supply only from participants who are approved and non-compliance with this provision will constitute an offence for which rigorous penalties will be imposed. That will be a difficult matter to oversee given that the imported product from other jurisdictions will not have the same force of law as the primary product. The Bill is extremely weak in this regard</P>
    <P>On the registration and approval process for a permit &ndash; this is a licence to farm &ndash; it is proposed the inspection of farms will be carried out as part of the animal disease test. This is what I wish to see happening. It is important that as many inspections as possible are carried out at the same time. Farmers do not want six or eight inspections of their farms in one year. In the case of an inter-family transfer of a farm or where a farmer decides to dramatically change his farming business, there should be no hold up as a result of the changes under the Bill. We must ensure young farmers are given every opportunity to succeed.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to an important point to which the Minister should give serious consideration before Committee and Report Stages. Where participants are found not to be in compliance with the scheme, they will first be warned and then given a reasonable time to improve their farms. This is as it should be. There will be many seminars on this issue. Having said that, where the Department believes participants are still non-compliant, their herd numbers will be withdrawn. The only avenue then open to the farmer is the Circuit Court. This would be a big decision for a farmer and I am not sure it is necessary. While I accept there is a need for judicial involvement in the reinstatement of herd numbers, involving the Circuit Court would be very costly. Instead of involving lawyers and junior and senior counsel, there should be a simple process where farmers whose herd numbers have been removed could put forward a case. If they are not able to put forward a strong enough case, their herd numbers would not be reinstated. Given the sensitivities of the situation, the Minister will have to be more imaginative in dealing with this issue. However, we will debate the matter further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to dramatically increase a number of the penalties attaching to the scheme. Anyone who defrauds or sets out to defraud the Department should be subjected to the full rigours of the law. No one can deny that this should be the case and it is against that background that stiff penalties must be put in place. We can debate the level of those penalties on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The most serious flaw in the Bill relates to the <Col N="1195" /> appeal mechanism. The Minister has not given adequate consideration to this matter. On a daily basis I hear about penalties being imposed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in respect of frivolous matters. Perhaps this runs contrary to the public perception of the Department, but the penalties imposed on farmers do not match their crimes.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the case of a sheep farmer who, when applying for this year's ewe hogget grant, stated that he had nine ewe hoggets. As the Minister is aware, a document issues to claimants a number of weeks after their initial application asking if they wish to make revisions. At that stage, the farmer discovered that the original information he supplied was wrong and stated on the reply form that he only had eight ewe hoggets. The case was referred to an appeals officer and even though it was accepted that the farmer had made a mistake his application for the grant was refused. The farmer to whom I refer only lost £100 but, and I intend no personal criticism of the Minister when I say this, the ewe hogget scheme is badly administered. The farmer did not set out to do wrong and on discovering his initial error he supplied the Department with the correct information.</P>
    <P>If we increase the penalties to a point where they might put farmers out of business, we must do three things. In the interests of natural justice, people should be given the opportunity to make their appeal at county level. There is no point in informing farmers in Cork, Glenamoy in County Mayo or anywhere else that their appeals will be held in Dublin. If they could attend their local courts, they would not be obliged to travel to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The appeal system should be set up at county level so that farmers could have access to oral hearings in their localities. Farmers are not good at putting their cases in writing and there is no reason the Minister could not introduce an appeals system such as that operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Appeals officers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development could appear in designated places and, if necessary, persons appearing before them could be accompanied by representatives from the industry. This would allow a farmer, his wife or adviser to provide a detailed version of events. If the matter cannot be resolved at that point, there should be some form of judicial review which would not oblige people to go before the Circuit Court. A farmer who takes legal action to have his herd number reinstated must employ senior and junior counsel and solicitors and if he loses the case he will incur huge costs.</P>
    <P>In the event that anyone might misconstrue the meaning of my earlier remarks, I reiterate that the requisite penalties should be imposed on people who set out to defraud the Department. However, in the interests of natural justice, we should ensure that oral hearings are held locally. <Col N="1196" /> If the scheme is to be accepted by farmers throughout the country, action of that sort must be taken.</P>
    <P>There is a need to engage in a serious examination of the TB and brucellosis schemes. The beef assurance scheme will be central to such an examination. With regard to badgers carrying TB, is it possible, following the various monitoring initiatives, etc., to definitively state that 24 per cent or 25 per cent of badgers carry TB? I accept that there are large numbers of badgers in the countryside and I am aware of the environmental constraints that apply. Has any further progress been made in terms of developing a vaccine to neutralise this disease in badgers? Will there be a cull of badgers or has the Minister any advice to give farmers in terms of what they should do about this problem? Would it not be ironic, following the investigation and research carried out in respect of badgers in the past, if we discovered that they were major carriers and we sat back for ten years without taking any action?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate whether a blood test for TB is under development? I have been informed on many occasions that we were close to breakthrough. I understand that the tuberculin test is only 90 per cent effective and I hope that this matter will be solved before the problems become enormous.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take the issues I have raised on board because I will be tabling amendments in respect of them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill is important and should be supported by all parties. Following the outbreak of cases of BSE in cattle and the new variant, CJD, in young people in 1996, there has been a substantial reduction in beef consumption within the EU. In addition, a number of markets to which Ireland has traditionally supplied cattle and beef &ndash; such as those in Iran and other countries in the Middle East &ndash; have imposed full or partial trade restrictions on Irish cattle and beef exports.</P>
      <P>The key response to this was to adopt measures to tighten up the conditions of production and processing of cattle and beef in Ireland and to provide assurances to consumers and buyers regarding the safety of Irish cattle and beef. Notwithstanding this, it is considered that further measures are required in the beef related sector to underpin confidence at home and abroad. It is for this reason that the Bill, which, in essence, establishes a national beef assurance scheme, is being debated this week.</P>
      <P>Agriculture and the food industry are important to Ireland. Agriculture still forms the backbone of economic development in the vast majority of rural areas. The Government fully recognises the economic and social importance of agriculture in terms of job creation and the maintenance of the countryside. The Government has ensured that the interests and concerns of Irish farmers and their families are fully recognised when any national initiatives are formulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> A clear example of this is the recent CAP reform negotiations which took place at EU level.</P>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 CAP reform agreed by the EU Agriculture Council on 11 March 1999 and finalised at a meeting of EU Heads of Government in Berlin on 26 March sets out the broad policy and production position for the Irish agriculture and food industries over the next seven years. The Berlin Council modified the reform arrangements for the milk, dairy and cereal sectors along the lines which Ireland sought throughout the negotiations. When the European Commission published its initial CAP reform proposals in March 1998 the annual loss to Irish agriculture was estimated at £233 million per year, but the changes negotiated in the final CAP agreement negated that loss. Price reductions in the beef, cereal and dairy sectors will be offset by appropriate compensatory measures. Moreover, degressivity, which is the concept of reducing direct payments by a fixed percentage cumulatively over seven years, is also part of the overall agreement. Between 2000 and 2006 the final agreement will deliver a substantial gain of £395 million in farm incomes.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to the implementation of initiatives termed &ldquo;the accompanying measures under the CAP programme administered from Europe&rdquo;. These include the early farm retirement scheme; the installation aid scheme; the dairy hygiene programme; the rural environmental protection scheme; and the Leader III rural development initiative. These programmes must continue if Irish agriculture is to prosper while, at the same time, taking account of the changing nature of agricultural activities.</P>
    <P>The facts speak for themselves with regard to demonstrating the importance of the food industry in terms of employment. The industry is estimated to account for 38,500 jobs directly, which is more than 15 per cent of the industrial workforce. More than 12,000 people are employed in the slaughtering and preserving of meat; 7,200 in the manufacture of dairy products; 2,700 in the manufacture of poultry products; 5,500 in the baking industry; 4,000 in sugar manufacture; and more than 7,300 in other related industries. The food production sector provides important benefits in terms of indirect employment and in its contribution to the agricultural and wider rural economies.</P>
    <P>Following the BSE crisis more innovative measures need to be implemented under the operational sub-programme for the development of the food industry. If employment in the food production sector is to improve initiatives which could be introduced in this regard include the allocation of greater resources to Bord Bia for the implementation of marketing and the promotion activities of Irish food products in Britain and Europe and increased resources for consumer complaints in the area of improving the traceability of food products. Ireland is currently the third largest supplier of food and drink products <Col N="1198" /> to Britain with exports valued at £1,800 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>A national strategy to redirect food exports to the EU consumer marketplace based on the highest standards of food quality, safety and traceability is also needed. This is only possible in the context of much closer integration between farmers and food processors. I read with interest the recent report, &ldquo;Opportunities, Challenges and Capacities for Choice&rdquo; , which was published by the National Economic and Social Council. I agree with the council's interpretation of the challenges facing the food industry. Ensuring that Irish food products are recognised as being of the highest quality means more moneys must be put aside to promote them in different marketplaces.</P>
    <P>Since the outbreak of BSE in 1996 consumers' views towards food products have changed substantially. This was recognised by the EU in the Amsterdam Treaty, which was ratified by the people last year. New powers were given to the EU to implement initiatives and policies in the area of consumer protection and public health, with particular emphasis on protecting the health of humans. More recently, the chicken dioxin scandal in Belgium once again put the issue of food safety at the top of the EU's agenda. The new President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, and the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, David Byrne, are working flat out to make sure that EU initiatives are brought forward which will protect the food chain and ensure greater consumer confidence in EU food products. This is also important in light of the World Trade Organisation talks currently taking place in Seattle given that food safety will be put at the top of the agenda as the EU and the US negotiate future trade agreements.</P>
    <P>All these EU initiatives will complement programmes brought forward by the Government to protect the image and quality of Irish food products. That is why I fully support the national beef assurance scheme. The legislation is a key response to past food scares in the cattle, beef and animal feed sectors and, particularly, the BSE crisis. It will protect both consumers and producers by providing assurances that Irish beef is safe and underpinning confidence in the industry at home and abroad. It will also consolidate a wide range of legislation in the cattle, beef and animal feed sectors to develop common high standards of production and processing. These standards will be applied through a process of mandatory registration, inspection and approval and will cover all participants in the industry, including farmers, cattle dealers, live exporters, livestock marts, abattoirs, meat processing plants and the animal feed manufacturing and trading sectors.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not apply to the retail trade sector but there will be an obligation on it to deal only with participants approved under the scheme. The intention is that only persons who meet the prescribed standards will be approved for partici<Col N="1199" /> pation in the cattle, beef and feedstuffs industries. The standards in question are contained in existing legislation and cover such matters as animal identification, health, remedies, feed, health, hygiene and hygiene practices; production and manufacturing practices; construction, maintenance and operation of premises and equipment; and the environment, including pollution and waste management. In addition, the legislation includes a provision enabling the Minister to make regulations in regard to record keeping and documentation of matters such as production, processing and manufacturing practices. It also provides for the Minister to regulate the identification and registration of bovine animals and, in particular, the possession of ear tags and identity cards and tampering with same.</P>
    <P>All participants in the scheme will be subject to an inspection, the procedures for which will be determined by the Minister. If participants are in compliance they will be issued with a final approval notice. The period of validity of this approval will be open ended. However, all approved parties will be subject to ongoing monitoring to ensure continued compliance with the scheme. Participants who are found not to be in compliance will be informed of the steps that must be taken to bring them into compliance. If they continue not to comply, they will be given notice of the Minister's intention to refuse or revoke approval and they will have an opportunity to make representations to him or her. In addition, there is provision for an appeal procedure to the courts in the event of the refusal or revocation proceeding.</P>
    <P>Section 8 places a duty on existing farmers, feed manufacturers or traders, dealers or exporters of live animals, abattoirs, assembly centres, marts and meat plants and any new entrants to the marketplace to apply for a certificate of approval within 12 months of enactment of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Public Enterprise to introduce a number of specific public transport initiatives to encourage the greater utilisation of urban public transport services, including:</P>
      <P>&ndash;increasing the State subsidy to Dublin Bus to an average of five pence per passenger journey on condition that integrated ticketing systems and late night services are made available;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;the franchising out of bus routes to the private sector where Bus Éireann is cur<Col N="1200" /> rently not providing a service in order to increase the total level of public transport provision;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the necessary investment to provide for a comprehensive series of park 'n' ride facilities and feeder bus services attached to all quality bus corridors;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the immediate issuing of 50 per cent more taxi licences in the greater Dublin area;</P>
    <P>and implement a comprehensive capital investment programme for public transport nationally, including new structures to ensure the successful operation of public private partnerships.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to focus on some of the national transport issues as this is my only chance to do so other than at Question Time when it is rare for Members to have an opportunity to develop points beyond sound bites. The Minister has been in office for two and a half years and this will be her third Christmas as Minister with responsibility for transport and public enterprise. A new Secretary General of the Department is due to start shortly and I wish him well and congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
      <P>In my constructive view, there is no overarching national transport policy. There is a fundamental need for a White Paper on public transport. The nature of and procedure involved in a White Paper on transport means that it would be considered by other Departments and would become a Government project. It would be central in the political prioritisation of Government and it would send a message on how the Government intends to modernise the transport systems. I make this point in a positive and constructive spirit, but that is the only way to ensure the type of seismic shift which is necessary to make people switch from private motoring to public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper would confront the issue of whether there is a need for new administrative structures to deal with the plethora of agencies that are failing to come to grips with traffic gridlock in the greater Dublin area. It is good that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, will speak later because transport issues straddle at least three major Departments &ndash; the Department of Public Enterprise, the Department of the Environment and Local Government in relation to roads, taxis, etc. and the Depart<Col N="1201" /> ment of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to Operation Freeflow.</P>
    <P>The public transport operator and CIE's subsidy is dealt with by one Department and there is a need for new structures to deal with that area. No matter how much success a person working under the auspices of Dublin Corporation can achieve, the system will not work unless he or she has some input into bus fare policy and enforcement through Operation Freeflow. A new greater Dublin transport authority is needed to radically re-regulate all aspects of public transport and motoring in Dublin. A White Paper could address that issue.</P>
    <P>I am still unhappy that the operator with responsibility for DART and rail services generally is also responsible for safety. There should be a delineation and separation of functions in this area. This would ensure that people who must deal with operational pressures, such as juggling financial difficulties, the issue of overcrowding and other issues, such as whether a level crossing should be refurbished or more rail cars provided, would not also deal with safety. The issue of inadequate resources puts pressure on safety issues and the Minister has made it abundantly clear that day-to-day responsibility for safety lies with CIE. This is the legal position but bringing this area within the remit of an independent body, such as the Health and Safety Authority of Ireland which would monitor the situation with interim and annual reports, is the right way forward.</P>
    <P>A White Paper could deal with the vexed questions we face regarding the future of Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta. It is only in the context of an overall access transport policy through a White Paper that such issues can be addressed and we can consider whether they are utilities or commercial operations. I am aware that the Government intends to produce a national spatial plan which will deal with housing and other developments. If it is intended to organise commuting developments to avoid the type of difficulties that currently exist in large conurbations, a White Paper on transport needs to be developed simultaneously with any spatial plan. I will not labour that point but issues such as disabled access, to which I will refer later, need to be made a high political priority because they are policy questions. In the early 1980s, Deputy Jim Mitchell prepared a Green Paper, but there is now a need for a comprehensive White Paper on this area.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, will deal in detail with the situation in Dublin but I wish to make some general points. The Minister has been good at making announcements. She is good at going to Dublin Castle and being part of launches, such as the launch of the national development plan. I am sure there will be another launch in relation to the budget.</P>

      <P>This is linked to the bus fares issue. There has been a hike of 5.5 per cent in bus fares. The Minister is the first office holder for some time to increase bus fares but I hoped there would be simultaneous integrated ticketing. It should be similar to the call card system where one can get a call card from Eircom and use it in any telephone kiosk. I also favour the introduction of a travel card which could be used on rail, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann inter-city services. This is the type of innovation I favour in relation to integrated ticketing.

      <P>There will be candles for the power cuts and if there are buses, there will be a price hike at the start of the new year. This is what I call a cold shower at the start of the new millennium. Dublin Bus has the lowest level of public subsidy of any public transport company in any capital city of the 15 EU member states. We have worked it out. It is 20p per week per person living in the greater Dublin. That is the level of public subsidy. We are setting out a modest request, to increase it from 3.38p per journey to 5p per journey. That is a reasonable request. I would have thought that in the present climate of trying to get people out of motor cars and onto public transport, this was the time to take that initiative rather than a fare increase.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but she has left commuters to walk the walk on the issue of taxis so far because, frankly, the taxi situation has gone from desperate to horrendous. It started with people writing to me with anecdotes about queuing late at night for literally an hour and a half for a taxi. Now I get letters from people telling me that when they try to book a taxi at any time between 4.00 p.m. and 7.00 p.m. they are told the taxi firms are no longer taking bookings. The situation has become unbelievably and drastically dire. If someone wants to book a taxi to go to hospital, they are simply told they have to fend for themselves, that there are no taxis available. I hope we are not going to get a Christmas hamper from the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, and, like Operation Freeflow, find that in the cold days of January we will revert to the current position. We have 2,700 taxis in Dublin. We have suggested an immediate measure to increase that number by 50 per cent, and to allow hackneys to use bus lanes. They could have some kind of identification on them. That would not cause an administrative difficulty if we are going to have so many trainee gardaí watching the bus lanes. <Col N="1204" /> Many of the hackneys do not operate during the day, as pointed out by my colleague, Deputy Mitchell. There are currently some 5,000 hackneys, for which we are not getting public transport value. It is not that this is beyond solutions of public administration. There are readily available opportunities. The anecdotes I am hearing are quite horrendous.</P>
      <P>The next issue is the quality bus corridors. They have been provided in Lucan, Malahide and Stillorgan. The one with which I am most familiar is the one which the Minister availed of &ndash; another nice PR opportunity&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that there are people living in Bray, Ashford, Rathnew and all over Wicklow and north Wexford, who need to commute to Dublin every day. The bus and the QBC will not bring them home. They are not interested in a partial journey. They are interested in a complete journey, and the only way to make the QBC effective for them is to provide somewhere for them to park their cars in the morning and collect them in the evening, letting the QBC deal with the city leg of their journey. The failure to provide 4,000 park and ride spaces as part of the provision of the QBCs is of fundamental concern to me. When I contacted Owen Keegan about this issue, he said that was beyond the functional area of Dublin Corporation, that it was outside his territory. He said he agreed with me, but that there was nothing he could do about it. This should have been included as a fundamental design feature with any QBC, as is the case in cities all over Europe. I ask the Ministers, particularly the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to ensure there are designated areas, now that the tax incentives are in place, for park and ride facilities.</P>
      <P>I wish to turn now to something that is clearly within the ambit of the Minister for Public Enterprise. She alluded in one of her earlier interjections to the £2 billion she got&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to see exactly how it will work out. My particular concern is twofold. The Luas tunnel has been a pet project of the Minister <Col N="1205" /> because she inherited the Tallaght, Dundrum, city centre Luas project which was to cost £221 million. It had European funding, but in May 1998 the Government upscuddled that, saying it was going to go for an underground Luas tunnel. Then, at a later date, the Minister said she thought it would be a rather good idea, with which I agree, to have a rail link to Navan and another, coming off the Dublin-Belfast route, linking up with Swords and the airport. I have searched the national development plan to find these three projects. At page 55, paragraph 4.23 it is stated: &ldquo;A contingency provision of £500 million has been made for this&rdquo;. This is the underground section, which will not be available until the geotechnical studies, which will be a nightmare in their own right, have been completed at the end of 1999. Then I tried to find where we had the other proposals, and at page 56, paragraph 4.26, it is stated that a number of options for future development in the suburban rail network are being evaluated from a feasibility and cost perspective and that these include a new inland rail link to Navan, separation of long-distance and commuter rail traffic through construction of bypass rail lines, a new rail link from Belfast through Swords and Dublin Airport to the western lines, and a new rail link east of the current loop line in Dublin city centre, quadrupling the existing double lines where feasible, provision of enhancement of rail services for the development centres identified in strategic planning guidelines, including Drogheda, Naas, Newbridge, Kilcullen, Wicklow, Navan, Athy, Arklow, Kildare and Monasterevin, and more sophisticated signalling. Having had my hopes raised that we were going to have some progress on the tunnel and all these issues, I read: &ldquo;As already stated, the same contingency provision of £500 million has been made for the implementation of this programme in the underground section of Luas&rdquo;. Here we have wonderful projects, enhancement of rail services all over the place, in Drogheda, Navan, Newbridge, Wicklow, Athy, Arklow, we have our underground tunnel and we have an airport link, all for £500 million. This is bogus. This is false. This cannot be done for this type of money. It will become patently obvious that sections 4.26 and 4.23 of the national plan do not hang together, and how woefully inadequate is the contingency fund of £500 million that has been provided for this. It might not cover even one of the projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy come up with only £2.2 billion as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that, whatever about the Minister's enthusiasm for each and all of these projects, the Department of Finance has steadfastly refused to sign up to these projects, the Navan rail link, the Dublin Airport rail link and the underground tunnel. They will be shoved down to some public-private partnership project and become a long-term pipe dream. The short-<Col N="1206" /> term reality is that £500 million will not even provide the tunnel, let alone the other projects. I want to make it abundantly clear that this element of the plan does not stand up to scrutiny. It is bogus in relation to the contingency fund being unable to achieve the projects set out for it in rail alone, be it light or heavy rail, and people should see it for what it is and not have their expectations raised as they have been yet again only to be dashed.</P>
      <P>In relation to public-private partnership projects, I raised Question No. 15 in the Dáil today with the Taoiseach in regard to what exactly is the state of play because people who are interested in design build and operate transport projects, who are prepared to invest a lot of money, tell me the units of PPPs in the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise, and Finance, are not strong enough to bring this to fruition. A new directorate will be required, and the expertise and commercial dynamic does not exist in these Departments.</P>
      <P>It is in the area of bus competition, particularly inter-city services, that I remain most disappointed with this Government's approach. The Minister takes a motorway approach to her Department. In the fast lane are the PR and consultancy people who make the Minister as photogenic as possible. In the middle land are issues that trundle along, such as Books of Estimates and national plans but in the slow lane is the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob and things that do not deserve any priority are consigned to him. Bus competition has been consigned to Deputy Jacob and will make little or no progress under this administration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stagg had done an amount of work in Government on the 1932 Road Transport Act. There is a consensus between the ICTU people and others with regard to legalising the <i>de facto</i>situation, setting uniform standards and enforcing proper insurance and tax compliance. I regret the Government's lack of political impetus.</P>
      <P>The Vantastic group which provides a client-based service to 400 physically disabled people in Dublin city and county has put forward a submission to the Taoiseach for £380,000. If they do nothing else, I hope the Minister and the Government will look kindly on providing annual funding for that group so that disabled people whose needs cannot all be met by public transport can avail of that service.</P>
      <P>I commend the motion to the House and I look forward to the Government's response to it. I hope the Government's initiative on taxis endures longer than one Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, as outlined by my colleague, Deputy Yates, calls for some very reasonable measures which could be implemented very quickly by the Government. These measures have been suggested before by Members on this side of the House and by others outside. We are perplexed by the fact that it is <Col N="1207" /> necessary to propose these measures again. Why is everyone in the country with the exception of the Government talking about traffic? Can it be that the Government is not aware that the greater Dublin area is grinding to a standstill? Journey times are lengthening every day, the quality of life is appalling and deteriorating, it is almost impossible for business people to move their goods, transport costs are rising, we are losing thousands of man hours in traffic queues every week and traffic is the major constraint to our growth potential. I cannot believe that no one on the other side of the House has noticed this. The Government has not only failed to deal with issues which could alleviate the problem in the short term but, even more disturbingly, has not given any indication that it is aware that there is a crisis which is deepening with every day that passes.</P>
      <P>The Government knows the traffic figures, the demand for daily trips and the projections for traffic and population for the coming years. It is aware that the figures are scary and is probably aware that the new figures on which the DTO is now working are even scarier and indicate that a quantum leap in traffic provision is now needed. The Minister should forget about the provision of a few extra DART carriages and an extra QBC or two. Incremental improvements are no longer sufficient. Such extensions will not come close to meeting the current demand which increases weekly. A completely new and fundamental shift in approach is now required.</P>
      <P>I accept that none of this will happen overnight although half the lifetime of a Government should be long enough, at least to begin. However, long-term plans will be completely irrelevant if Dublin cannot continue to function in the short term and to drive and sustain the country's economic prosperity. In the short term, Dublin's only hope of salvation lies in additional buses because that is the only method of transport which can be provided on the scale and within the timespan necessary. I am not talking about a few additional buses or about the handful of buses which Dublin Bus might buy with fares revenue. Buses must be provided in large numbers. This may mean that the company will lose money and this is why we call for the payment of a subvention. For a time some of these buses may be empty during the day but that is what is required if people are to be persuaded to leave their cars and use public transport. People must believe that a real alternative is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost all the buses which were bought last year with Luas money are now in use and they have not even begun to meet demand. They have not even succeeded in holding traffic congestion at last year's level. There are plans to open another nine QBCs in the next few months. We know of their ability to absorb buses yet not a single additional bus has been ordered. I realise there is provision in the national development plan for more buses but putting buses in the plan <Col N="1208" /> and putting them on the street are two different things. These buses should have been ordered months ago for delivery now. It is hard to know what we are waiting for when the money is available and the need is apparent.</P>
    <P>In the suburbs there is mayhem. There are almost no orbital services, feeder routes or services for the new housing and employment locations. This is causing more than mere traffic chaos. It is causing real and ongoing daily hardship for people in the suburbs and in some cases denying people access to employment, not to mentions its effect on our stress levels and on the environment. If CIE cannot deal with the problem why can the private sector not be allowed to? What are the ideological objections to allowing private bus operators to provide services which Dublin Bus clearly cannot provide? After years of pressure we succeeded in having two licences allocated for the Dublin Airport area while the rest of the applications lie on departmental desks, unanswered. Applicants do not even receive the courtesy of a reply. Far from thwarting the efforts of private bus owners and ignoring their submissions, the Minister should be actively seeking tenders for new services. If she will not do that she should at least allow the local authorities in and around Dublin to franchise out their own routes. They, at least, know the pattern and extent of local demand and could meet the need better than the Department. Extra capacity is needed from the private sector but we also need competition to prevent the outrage of more than 20 Imp buses being hidden around the country rotting away. This is a waste of public money and an insult to the public. It would not happen in a competitive public transport environment.</P>
    <P>The fiasco of our transport management is exemplified by the failure to introduce integrated ticketing. This has been talked about endlessly and studied by consultants and committees but, far from encouraging the public to use public transport by making journeys simpler, their options have been reduced by the abolition of the ten journey ticket. We have the money, the technology and the need for integrated ticketing so why can we not have a single multi-purpose ticket? Why can the State provider not do what every other country in Europe can do, no matter how poor? What is wrong with a Minister who allows this situation to go on year after year?</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that QBCs were planned and implemented without accompanying park and ride facilities. If the Minister were in the House I would ask her to intervene, even at this late stage, to ensure that future QBCs are not opened without these facilities or at least that areas are designated for them. The result of the opening of the Stillorgan Road QBC has been to turn the adjacent residential roads and villages into blanket carparks, adding to local congestion and general misery. Even bike and ride facilities have not been provided and these could be provided very cheaply at junctions along the QBC. They would significantly increase the catchment area of the <Col N="1209" /> QBC and take a percentage of the population out of cars and on to bikes and buses. If the Minister wanted a really quick measure, bike and ride facilities could be installed next week, in time for Christmas.</P>
    <P>At this time of year even the Tánaiste's and the Taoiseach's minds turn to taxis, unfortunately too late to do anything in time for Christmas although we all await the Minister's announcement. It was the Taoiseach's intervention in setting up the taxi forum to allow taxi licence owners air their grievances which delayed the issuing of any licences for several months. I do not know if that was the intention but it was futile because even he now accepts the compelling evidence that additional licences are needed and must continue to be issued until supply equals demand. If the Minister wants a measure which would be popular and easy to implement will he please allow the hackneys use the bus lanes, at least in the run up to Christmas? There are 5,000 licensed hackneys in Dublin and at peak hour traffic, which is most of the day, at least half if not two-thirds of them stay at home because it does not make economic sense for them to go out to work. They are paid on a mileage system. If it takes an hour or an hour-and-a-half to go five miles it makes sense for them to stay at home. It does not make sense for the Government to deprive the public of the use of 2,000 or 3,000 cabs when people are screaming for a service. There is an identification issue but surely it is not beyond human ingenuity to produce some kind of car sticker that would identify those hackneys pending the introduction of the official ID system.</P>
    <P>At this time of year, and at any time, a good taxi and hackney service is essential for a capital city and is essential to encourage a switch to public transport. At this time of year when many people are taking extra journeys, when there are extra visitors home for the millennium celebrations, liquid lunches and so on, it does not make sense to actively discourage from providing a service, those who are willing and available to provide one.</P>
    <P>Another issue that could be tackled in the short-term is urban school transport if somebody was willing to take a handle on this. A real contribution could be made by subventing secondary schools &ndash;  I target them because they have larger catchment areas than primary schools &ndash; and giving them a subsidy to provide their own local school transport, instead of a blanket subsidy to CIE. It would provide a locally focused service suited to the individual needs of the pupils of each school and to school timetables which Dublin Bus do not seem able to address. There are thousands of Dublin parents who take their cars to work, only because they have to drop children to school. This often results in journeys in several directions at peak time, thus adding to congestion. This could be avoided if a little imagination was applied to the problem. It is a system that exists in every European country and in rural <Col N="1210" /> areas and nobody can understand why it cannot apply in Dublin.</P>
    <P>My colleague mentioned also the plans for Christmas. One of the best kept secrets of the millennium is the CIE plan for late night services. Is there a plan? Will there be a repeat of last year's fiasco where the Minister announced one day that there would be a late night service and took it back the next day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any buses that day? I do not think it is premature at this stage to ask if there are any plans as, this year more than any other, people are trying to plan in advance and to organise their trips and their celebration venues based on the availability of public transport. People are taking a responsible attitude to drinking and driving. We now know that the doubling of the taxi fleet which was promised by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste was just a flight of pre-Christmas fancy. The public is entitled to be told if there are any other public transport provisions made for the millennium. Christmas is only a once-a-year event, and thanks be to God I will not ever have to worry about the millennium again, but my main concern is for the other 11 months of the year. If there was a sense of urgency all the measures mentioned could be put in place in the short-term and we could soon see an impact on the streets.</P>
      <P>I concentrate on the short-term because the problem of congestion on the streets of Dublin City and county and in the surrounding counties is getting worse on a monthly basis so that the measures that might have had some impact today will be wholly inadequate in six months' time. That is the reason the Government must take this problem by the scruff of the neck and act now or accept that Dublin will no longer be a viable entity. Instead of action, the Government has given us plans for the future. For a while so many plans were being issued that the public was fooled into believing it would wake up some day and everything would be all right. However it has learned that that is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently the mantra and the excuse for inaction has been that it will all be contained in the National Development Plan. I welcome the money allocated to transport infrastructure in the plan but the reality is, and the other side must be aware of this, that it is our children's children who will benefit from that spend. As well as plan<Col N="1211" /> ning for the future the Government has to deal with the now, otherwise Dublin has no future. It is time for the Taoiseach to take personal political responsibility for changing whatever inertia and mindset is dictating the pace of response to this crisis. If he cannot deliver even short-term solutions to a problem which we face daily and which is impossible to forget or to avoid any day of the week, what hope is there of reaching the targets in the national development plan? We fail to meet the targets in the national development plan, in the roads area by £2 billion at a time when there are no shortages or constraints on the economy. On road construction alone, the plan requires a spend of three times more every year than we achieved on average over the seven years of the last plan. Put in context, that is the equivalent of building the south eastern motorway, the Port Tunnel and the Waterford, Kinnegad and Limerick bypasses every single year for the next seven years. What has been done to gear up for that kind of spend? Has anything been done to bring in the necessary expertise and labour to ensure we spend even a fraction of that? What has been done to resource the National Roads Authority, the Department of the Environment and Local Government or the local authorities with planners, engineers, consultants, technicians and so on required to increase their output by 300 per cent? What has been done to streamline procedures to make it possible? What has been done to reduce the 17 stages of departmental approval required by a local authority for every road project?</P>
    <P>Having responsible controls and monitoring procedures is one thing but this is not control, this is departmental fetish which we cannot afford to indulge in any longer. Something must be done to streamline procedures. Neither on the short-term measures nor on the long-term measures have we seen any sense of urgency and what we are seeking is an acknowledgment by the Government that it is aware we have a crisis and that it can deal with it.</P>
    <P>Governments are judged harshly always. If it fails to deliver on this one issue, which affects everybody as well as jeopardising our economic prosperity now and into the future, it will be judged very harshly. Generations have worked hard and made sacrifices for this prosperity and will not forgive a Government that throws it away. There is forgiveness for Governments which fail due to lack of money but when a Government has the plans, has been forewarned and has an embarrassment of money, mercy will not be shown.</P>

      <P>&ndash;welcomes the £2.2 billion provision for public transport in the national development plan;</P>

      <P>&ndash;notes the commitment in the revised programme for Government to introduce measures to increase progressively the number of taxi licences in Dublin as quickly as possible in order to ensure a proper balance between supply and demand in the market.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to support the motion as amended. Transport management in Dublin in all its aspects is rightly a matter of urgent public and political concern.</P>
      <P>My Department is sponsor of the Dublin Transportation Office which is mandated to drive and co-ordinate the implementation of the Dublin Transport Initiative. As my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, will set out in more detail, much has already been achieved under this process. By end-2000, more than £5000 million will have been invested in Dublin transport management and infrastructure projects within the DTI framework. Under the national development plan, which has just been published, more than £3 billion is provided to accelerate DTI implementation through the period 2000-2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DTI final report recognised that taxis form an important part of the overall transport system in Dublin. They are designed to provide the most flexible form of public transport, offering a door to door service at all times of the day. Taxis come <Col N="1213" /> within my delegated responsibilities as Minister of State and I will pay particular attention to this element of the motion. Deputies will be aware that the Government parties' revised An Action Programme for the Millennium has made an explicit commitment to improving the Dublin taxi service in the following terms: we will introduce measures to increase progressively the number of taxi licences in Dublin as quickly as possible to ensure a proper balance between supply and demand in the market. Tonight I am able to answer to the House in full as regards delivery of this commitment.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion calls for the issue of 50 per cent more taxi licences in the greater Dublin area. The Government's assessment is that this level of increase would not guarantee the high quality of service to the public that we now require. We consider that more needs to be done to reach a satisfactory solution, and I will shortly detail to the House the elements of that solution.</P>
    <P>To understand the background to the measures which the Government will now introduce, I will briefly recall the recent history of taxi licensing in Dublin. Dublin taxi numbers remained unchanged, in the region of 1,800, between the late 1970s and 1991. In 1991-92, the then Minister for the Environment provided for the issue of 150 additional taxi licences of which 50 were for a new category of wheelchair accessible taxi. A major review of taxi services was commissioned by the Dublin local authorities in 1998 from Oscar Faber, transport consultants. Their report proposed an annual issue of 350 new taxi licences to eliminate this shortfall over ten years. Following the analysis of the Oscar Faber review, as well as the recommendations of the Dublin Taxi Forum, Dublin Corporation decided to issue 1,220 taxi licences between 1997 and 2001. At the end of 1999, Dublin taxi numbers will stand at 2,700.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the recent improvements in Dublin taxi and hackney services brought about under the aegis of the joint committee of the Dublin Local Authorities on Taxi and Hackney Services and of the office of Director of Traffic, Dublin Corporation, and with input from the Dublin Taxi Forum. However, the gradual nature of these improvement policies has disadvantages. The major disadvantage is that Dublin, as capital of a rapidly growing economy, would have to wait until at least the year 2008 before eliminating the problem of current demand for taxi services. Strong growth in business, tourism and leisure demands in Dublin since the Oscar Faber report of 18 months ago makes it virtually certain that the report's estimates of present demand for taxis are conservative.</P>
    <P>As the capital of a rapidly expanding economy, Dublin has seen a rapidly increasing demand for mobility in all travel modes. Numbers passing through Dublin Airport have more than doubled since 1993 and are expected to reach almost 13 million in 1999. There are now approximately 122 hotels in Dublin compared to 88 in 1995, and <Col N="1214" /> tourism has become a major industry in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The present inadequate supply of taxis in Dublin risks harming the capital's reputation in the eyes of international business people and other visitors; it would also remain a source of frustration to residents of the city. A continuation of this situation for another eight years, albeit subject to gradual improvements, is not supportable. All of these factors have persuaded the Government that we need a more urgent and accelerated approach to matching Dublin taxi supply and demand. At the same time, we are conscious of the significant investment which many existing taxi providers have made in their industry and livelihood.</P>
    <P>The courts have made it clear that the State does not have a duty to uphold present traded values of taxi licences, but as far as possible, the Government wishes to devise solutions which will, in practice, be fair to existing taxi service providers as well as providing good service to the public. The Government has determined that a sufficient number of new taxi licences should, as soon as possible, be issued to make good the supply shortages in the Dublin taxi service.</P>
    <P>A new taxi licence will be offered to all individual taxi licence holders in the Dublin taximeter area. Some 500 of these licences will be for wheelchair accessible taxis, the balance for ordinary taxi licences. It is proposed that the taxi licence fees will be £2,500 in the case of ordinary taxi licences and £250 in the case of the wheelchair accessible taxi licences. The granting of wheelchair accessible licences will be determined on the basis of a lottery of applications to be designed and implemented by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, a further 500 taxi licences will also be granted on the basis of the current points assessment system for the award of taxi licences. This encourages the uptake of licences by existing taxi drivers or &ldquo;cosies&rdquo;, who have not been taxi licence holders. In the event that existing taxi licence holders either do not apply for a new licence or fail to pursue applications, it will be arranged that any shortfall will be taken up by means of a further offer of licences under the current assessment system. In all, these proposals are designed to increase the Dublin Taximeter Area taxi fleet by 3,100 to in excess of 5,800 by the end of 2000, including 1,300 wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>
    <P>The arrangements to implement these proposals will be determined in regulations to be prepared by my Department as a matter of urgency. These will temporarily suspend the present delegation of certain powers to Dublin local authorities. However, this delegation will be restored at the earliest possible date to allow the Dublin local authorities to maintain the equilibrium of taxi supply and demand into the future.</P>
    <P>I am confident this initiative will benefit the public and the Dublin taxi industry. The Dublin taxi market, like many other sectors of Dublin's <Col N="1215" /> economy, is capable of significant and sustained growth. As such, it can well support a larger and service driven industry to the mutual benefit of all concerned. The Government has acted decisively and well beyond the proposals of the motion to ensure a high quality taxi service for the Dublin public. I hope our actions will have the support of all members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for moving this motion. It provides the Government with an opportunity to set out its strategy for public transport over the period of the national development plan. Since taking office the Government has shown a commitment to public transport unparalleled in the history of the State. Over the past two and a half years we have taken a range of initiatives to improve the quality and quantity of public transport. We carried out the first ever comprehensive independent review of railway safety. Earlier this year we approved a five year railway safety programme costing £430 million. A Supplementary Estimate for £80 million will be presented for Dáil approval next week and £100 million is being provided for railway safety in the Estimates for next year. By these actions we have assured the future of the railway network.</P>
      <P>We have revitalised and expanded the Dublin light rail project. Preliminary physical work is starting on the Tallaght line. Both the Tallaght and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green lines have cleared all the statutory procedures.</P>
      <P>The Government immediately responded to the DTO short-term action plan and provided EU and Exchequer funding for the investment recommended in the plan. Implementation of the plan is largely on target for the end of 2000 and we are already seeing the fruits of that investment in areas such as the 150 new buses and the Stillorgan quality bus corridor. It is important to remember that the short-term action plan will, when fully implemented, deliver substantial increases in public transport capacity, increasing peak hour bus capacity by up to 45 per cent and rail capacity by up to 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government was the first to provide significant Exchequer resources for capital investment in public transport. We allocated £56 million in the 1999 Estimates and the Estimates for next year provide £235 million. The clearest possible demonstration of the Government's commitment to public transport is to be found in the national development plan, which sets out a clear and comprehensive strategy for the revitalisation of public transport. That strategy has two parts. The first is the transformation of the public transport system in the greater Dublin area. The second is a regional public transport programme which provides an assured future for the railway network, addresses the transportation require<Col N="1216" /> ments of the four provincial cities and provides for the upgrading of regional bus services.</P>
    <P>Over the seven years of the national plan it is proposed to invest £2.2 billion in public transport. That means we plan to spend an average of £6 million every week from now until the end of 2006. This is far and away the highest level of investment in public transport since the heyday of railway development in the latter part of the 19th century.</P>
    <P>On the national plan strategy for the greater Dublin area, the planned £1.6 billion investment is designed to address traffic growth through a combination of investment and demand management measures; to increase accessibility for all; and to provide a public transport network which addresses the requirements of the strategic planning guidelines.</P>
    <P>The planned public transport programme is designed to support the strategic planning guidelines published earlier this year. The guidelines, prepared by the regional and local authorities in the Dublin and mid-east regions, provide a strategic land use planning framework for the region. In framing the national plan, we have taken great care to align the transport programme with the land use framework. By doing this we have provided a single composite development framework for the region, covering transport, housing and economic development. Local authorities must also ensure that their development plans and planning decisions are fully in keeping with the strategic planning guidelines. It is only in this way that we can ensure a proper integration between transport and land use in the region.</P>
    <P>The public transport strategy for the greater Dublin area comprises an integrated package of measures, covering bus, rail and light rail, integration measures, traffic management and demand management. The package is based almost entirely on the recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Office, as published earlier this year in its transportation blueprint. It is designed to provide a quality public transport product which will offer a real alternative to private car commuting.</P>
    <P>The programme recognises that an improved bus service must be the core of any short-term strategy to address congestion. The increased role which the bus can play has been proven most recently by the positive impact of the new Stillorgan quality bus corridor. The strategy is designed to improve the quality, reliability, frequency and speed of bus services. The objective is to provide a much better mesh of bus services &ndash; radial, orbital, local and feeder.</P>
    <P>It is also planned to develop local bus services within the development centres identified by the strategic planning guidelines and to improve links between those centres and the city. The first of these local services has just been launched by Bus Éireann in Navan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> Overall we plan to invest £220 million in the bus network in Dublin and the surrounding counties. This will fund the purchase of 275 additional buses to increase the fleet by 28 per cent. It will also finance the replacement of more than 500 existing buses. This will permit the withdrawal from service of the oldest buses in the fleet, reduce the age of the fleet from seven to six years on average and increase the overall quality of buses. This strategy will be supported by measures to give better priority to the bus on the road network. Improved priority for buses is critical to improving the speed, reliability and overall quality of bus services, as well as ensuring the best possible use of the available resources. Under the national plan a further five quality bus corridors will be provided and the 12 corridors currently being provided will be upgraded.</P>
    <P>Suburban rail development in Dublin is being addressed in two parts: a short-term strategy and a longer term development programme. The purpose of the short-term programme is to maximise the use of the existing suburban rail network. It includes the provision of more than 100 extra DART and suburban rail cars, a range of signalling and infrastructural works, the lengthening of station platforms to cater for eight car trains and the opening of a number of new stations. It will involve an investment of £185 million and will increase DART capacity by almost 40 per cent and suburban rail capacity by 26 per cent. This is additional to the increasees in capacity being delivered under the DTO Short-term Action Plan, particularly through the purchase of DART and suburban rail cars.</P>
    <P>Once the short-term programme has been implemented, it will only be possible to develop rail services further by increasing the capacity of the rail network, especially in the city centre. How we provide this additional capacity requires very careful study. We need to find the right solutions which facilitate the longer term development of the rail network. It was for that reason that the Government decided in March that CIE should commission a major strategic rail study to address these very issues and to consider various ideas and concepts put forward in the strategic planning guidelines. Ove Arup are undertaking this study and when it is finished we will have a clear strategic basis for the longer term development of the suburban rail network. The Government has taken the prudent and sensible step of including a very substantial financial contingency in the national plan for the implementation of this strategic rail development programme. If further resources are required at a later stage, they will be provided. I have no doubt that public-private partnerships will play a vital role in implementing this programme.</P>
    <P>The national plan also makes full provision for the implementation of the enhanced and extended light rail network approved by Govern-<Col N="1218" /> ment in May 1998. A total of £430 million has been provided for the surface elements of the two lines &ndash; Tallaght to Connolly Station and Sandyford to Dublin Airport. A geotechnical study of the underground section in the city centre is nearing completion and a financial contingency has also been included in the national plan for this work. Preliminary work on the Tallaght line is already under way. The Sandyford line recently cleared the statutory procedures. We will see the first line up and running by early 2003 and the full network completed within the national plan period.</P>
    <P>Better integration of public transport in the city is also of major importance. A total of £50 million has been set aside to promote integration in a practical way. This will be used to provide an extra 3,700 park and ride places, introduce integrated ticketing and develop interchange facilities which make it easier to transfer from bus to bus or from one mode of transport to another.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully aware of the importance of integrated ticketing on the overall strategy. My Department is chairing a group which is developing detailed proposals for integrated ticketing. The Government recently decided that integrated ticketing should be introduced as quickly as possible during 2000.</P>
    <P>Under the DTO Short-term Action Plan, 2,700 park and ride places will be provided. Substantial progress has been made, particularly on rail-based park and ride sites. This has been assisted by the £2 million special allocation made to the Dublin Transportation Office in the 1999 budget. Bus-based park and ride is proving more difficult because of the shortage of suitable sites. However, the local authorities are working hard to develop appropriate sites.</P>
    <P>Two hundred million pounds has been set aside for traffic management measures designed to improve the efficiency and increase the capacity of the existing road network. Over the coming year the DTO will prepare a demand management strategy to maximise the impact of the investment and to ensure a sustainable approach to transport in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that improving the quality of public transport services in Dublin involves more than just providing the necessary capital for investment. This is explicitly acknowledged in the national plan. The Government has established a Cabinet infrastructure committee, chaired by the Taoiseach and including the Tánaiste, the Ministers for Finance, the Environment and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Public Enterprise and the Attorney General. It is assisted by a cross-departmental team of senior officials. That committee will monitor the implementation of the public transport programme, especially in Dublin. It will also provide a forum for addressing any institutional, administrative or regulatory reforms <Col N="1219" /> necessary to ensure a better quality public transport service.</P>
    <P>As evidence of the Government's determination to act in this area, my Department will complete a review of the Road Transport Act, 1932, within three months with a view to the introduction of competition in public bus transport in Dublin. I am sure Deputy Yates will be delighted to hear that. In recent months I have made a good start on that, as the Deputy will be aware. The conclusions of that review will be considered in the first instance by the Cabinet infrastructure committee. My Department has already commenced a consultative process, inviting the views of a range of organisations, including CIE, PAMBO and the trades unions. We will shortly invite the views of other organisations and the wider public. I would also welcome the views of Members of this House, particularly during this debate.</P>
    <P>Public-private partnerships will also play an important part in improving the delivery of public transport infrastructure and services. Both Luas and the strategic rail programme for the greater Dublin area are appropriate candidates for PPP. The national plan sets a target of £300 million for PPP-based public transport investment. However, the Minister for Finance made it clear at the launch of the national plan that the PPP targets were minimum ones. We will not be found wanting in using PPPs to accelerate the implementation of public transport projects. The Government is also increasing State support for public transport services. The subvention in 2000 will be £115.2 million compared to £108.9 million in 1999. The increase is 6 per cent which is well ahead of inflation. I expect that a large part of this increase will go to support the additional services being provided by Dublin Bus and that the level of subvention in the year 2000 will exceed the average 5p per journey suggested in the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to regional public transport. The national plan has allocated a total of £650 million for investment in public transport in the regions. Some £500 million pounds will be spent on revitalising the mainline railway network. Of this, £350 million will be spent on implementing the railway safety programme 1999-2003. Before the end of that period the railway safety task-force will be reconvened to prepare a second five-year programme.</P>
    <P>The current railway safety programme involves major expenditure on track renewal, signalling, level crossings, bridges, other infrastructure and, most importantly, improved safety management systems. About 490 kilometres of jointed track will be replaced with continuous welded rail. By the end of 2003 virtually all the track on the Dublin-Waterford, Mallow-Tralee, Dublin-Sligo, Athlone-Westport, and Dublin-Rosslare lines will <Col N="1220" /> have been renewed. Substantial progress will be made on other lines such as Ballina, Limerick-Ennis and Limerick Junction-Waterford. This will make a very important contribution to regional development and is a clear vote of confidence in the future of our existing railway network. In addition to the safety expenditure, a further £150 million will be spent on railway renewal and upgrading work, including the purchase of extra rolling stock and the upgrading of stations.</P>
    <P>By its actions, the Government has assured the future of the railway network. We have put in place a £500 million investment programme which will redress decades of under-investment. The challenge now for CIE is to improve the quality of service across the network so that the railway will become the first choice for those travelling. We plan to spend £50 million on improving urban public transport in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. This expenditure is designed to increase the quantity and quality of public transport, particularly bus services, in those cities. Railway services will also be considered. Commuter rail services between Cork, Cobh and Mallow will be upgraded and the possibility of providing such services on the Cork-Midleton and Limerick-Ennis lines will be evaluated over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The investment programme will take particular account of the findings of local land use and transportation studies, such as those recently completed in Galway and under way in Limerick. These locally commissioned studies are especially useful since they provide a wider land use and socio-economic context for transport investment decisions.</P>
    <P>A total of £75 million will be spent on upgrading the Bus Éireann fleet and £12 million on improving regional bus services outside the main cities. The overall package will provide 450 replacement buses to upgrade the rural fleet and 110 new buses for the urban fleet. The Government has put public transport at the forefront of the agenda for national economic and social development. We have committed the necessary financial resources to achieve a major improvement in the quality and quantity of public transport services. We have set out a clear strategy. We have made it clear that we will address any impediments to the delivery of these improved services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion this evening refers to one of the most important social and economic <Col N="1221" /> challenges facing society at present, namely the provision of a high quality, efficient public transport system. Public transport in this country has suffered from decades of under-investment and official neglect. This prejudice against public transport has its roots in the conservative philosophy of the new right, popularised by both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. This narrow, soulless view of society dictated that everything private was good and everything public was bad.</P>
      <P>Public transport companies were perceived as being no different from those in the private sector. They should operate solely on a profit and loss basis. If losses were incurred then the company had failed and should be broken up and replaced. It is worthwhile to note that the main proponents of this view probably never used public transport and conceived their ideas from their own privatised ivory towers. What else would one expect? This narrow, prejudiced economic view of public transport had its followers in this country and their influence held sway until very recently.</P>
      <P>The damage which has flowed from this state of affairs can be seen every morning in Dublin and other large urban centres. The failure to invest in public transport, combined with the rising prosperity of certain sections of society and the frightening upsurge in car sales has resulted in chronic gridlock on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere. This congestion is costing billions each year in economic, environmental and social terms. On many occasions the House has heard about the economic cost of such congestion, but I also want to stress the environmental and health implications of the traffic mayhem we now have to deal with. Yesterday, I was struck by a report in a newspaper which related to the &ldquo;free-flow&rdquo; operation being put in place for the Christmas season. One of the initiatives was the re-introduction of a dedicated traffic radio station. This year, however, it will have an expanded remit. Not only will the station provide up-to-date reports on traffic flows, it will also give information on pollution levels in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that nearly a decade after smog was banished from the capital, we may be back at square one due to the carbon dioxide emissions from cars. The air pollution now resulting from car use in Dublin is of major concern. Respiratory illnesses strike young and old people hardest and the thousands of cars spewing pollutants into the air every day are poisoning the air we breathe. As a result, more strain is being placed on our health services and the quality of life of thousands of our citizens is being lowered. In addition, the rapidly increasing pollution from cars is fatally undermining Ireland's commitment to reduce greenhouse gases, as entered into at the Kyoto summit. If we are serious about meeting our legally binding obligations we must take urgent and <Col N="1222" /> radical action to cut down on car use, especially in cities and towns. The only way to achieve this objective is to invest in public transport and ensure that the privileges which have been extended to the private car in our urban centres come to an end.</P>
    <P>I welcome the call in the motion for an increased subsidy to Dublin Bus. We have one of the lowest State subventions of public transport among all our EU neighbours. If proof of this is needed, one only has to look at the standard of public transport which our citizens have to put up with. The lesson we have to learn is that public transport must be supported by the State, through a direct subvention from the Exchequer. The failure to do so in the past, albeit when Exchequer finances were in a much less healthy state, has lead to the current crisis.</P>
    <P>For some reason which escapes me, however, the Government believes that the travelling public must fork out for improvements in public transport. The forthcoming hike in fares, sanctioned by the Minister, is sight-shorted, counterproductive and downright mean. Why did the Government decide to make public transport more expensive for the travelling public when it had at hand an unprecedented sum of money? What logic lay behind this decision?</P>
    <P>An integrated ticketing system is urgently needed to make public transport more user friendly and efficient. Most other major cities in Europe operate such methods which facilitate and encourage smooth movement between different public transport systems. It provides added value to the traveller and also leads to a more coherent and integrated approach to transport planning.</P>
    <P>In her breakdown on public transport spending allocated in the national development plan, the Minister for Public Enterprise included the figure of £50 million under the heading &ldquo;to develop an integrated public transport system through the introduction of integrated ticketing, the provision of park-and-ride facilities and the development of interchange nodes&rdquo;. Like much in the national development plan it seems impressive at first glance, but on examination it is woefully lacking in detail. How much does the Minister intend to spend on establishing an integrated ticketing system? What is the timetable for its introduction? For how long will commuters have to endure a fractured public transport system that does not give them value for money and lacks co-ordination?</P>
    <P>Another major failing of our transport system is the failure to provide a comprehensive late night service. Our public transport system has failed to keep pace with the commercial and social changes that have occurred in urban life. Pubs, clubs and restaurants now open until the small hours of the morning, yet the vast majority of public transport closes down at 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> The Nitelink service that operates in Dublin is a welcome development, but we must realise the partial nature of this service. An expanded late night bus service and the introduction of late night DART services are urgently needed. I am aware of the industrial relations issues surrounding these developments. However, if the political will is there is introduce change, I am positive any outstanding issues can be resolved and the travelling public can be provided with the transport system it deserves and needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister's £50 million is also intended to provide additional park and ride facilities but, yet again, a timetable is not provided. However, in what the Minister described as &ldquo;among the highlights of the programme&rdquo; was a commitment to provide an extra 3,700 park and ride spaces. Is the great culmination of a seven year national development plan to provide 3,700 spaces? Some 70,000 additional cars were registered in Dublin alone in 1999.</P>
    <P>As we have learned from our experience with the DART and the quality bus corridors which have recently opened, parking spaces located at key points along the commuter network are essential to the success of public transport. The policy of providing tax incentives to construct multi-storey car parks in the city centre must be brought to a halt. If the State is to provide a tax incentive in this area, it should be transferred to the suburbs and directed towards park and ride facilities.</P>
    <P>However, we must also realise we cannot build car parks to cater for every car. An adequate system must be provided but, more importantly, we must develop the feeder bus service which joins our main public transport routes with major suburbs and housing estates. The Imp bus service, which has been introduced in Dublin over recent years, has proved very successful, especially in suburban areas. The expansion of this fleet to feed into our planned system of quality bus corridors is essential.</P>
    <P>With regard to taxis, the stranglehold which the powerful taxi lobby had on Fianna Fáil beggared belief. There is a chronic lack of taxis in Dublin city. I compliment the Minister on tackling that lobby and taking decisions which will, in effect, more than double the number of taxis available to the public by the end of one year. I am sure backbenchers, such as Deputies Callely and Noel Ahern, will not be too pleased, given their pronouncements on the matter in the House previously. It might be politically notable that a member of the Progressive Democrats made the announcement in the House. Perhaps that was a slap in the puss to people who made comments last week on another issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate. At long last, the ideology of the new right, the ideology which demeaned and debased the idea of public services and <Col N="1224" /> public provision, has been exposed as a fraud. Public transport is essential to the economic, social and environmental well being of any society. As such, it must be supported by public funds as a form of social investment. The left has always held to that view and I welcome the recent converts to our approach; a number of them are in the House this evening.</P>
    <P>However, the radical investment and improvement which we need in public transport can only come about if the political will to deliver this change exists. Decisions by the Government, such as the hike in public transport fares, the continued pursuit of a tunnel for Luas &ndash; which will never see the light of day &ndash; and the refusal, up to now, to take on the vested interests which have crippled the taxi service in Dublin cast grave doubt on the capacity of this Administration to bring about the necessary change.</P>
    <P>The national development plan, which is supposed to drive public transport policy for the next seven years, disappoints on a number of levels. It is clear the Minister and the Government have no strategic vision of public transport. The departmental wish lists, which have been compiled by civil servants, form the backbone of the transport elements of the development plan. However, the political content, the overriding strategy for the type of urban transport system we want to achieve by 2006, is non-existent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in supporting this motion, which calls on the Government to wake up to the traffic chaos in urban areas, particularly Dublin, and to take effective action to provide an efficient and cost-effective public transport system.</P>
      <P>The DART service is a major public transport facility in my constituency. There are ten DART stations in my constituency, running from Shankill to Booterstown. That facility is greatly appreciated by the people of that area. However, unfortunately, the DART service has seriously deteriorated recently.</P>
      <P>There is now serious and dangerous overcrowding on DART trains and at DART stations. For example, by the time a DART train leaving Bray at peak time reaches Killiney, which is only two stops away, there are no seats left, and by the time it reaches Blackrock it is impossible to get on the train. In stations from Blackrock into town at morning peak time, commuters &ndash; public transport customers of the DART service &ndash; scramble to get on to trains. That is extremely dangerous and uncomfortable. Elderly people do not now use the DART service, particularly at peak times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I know extra DART carriages have been promised. However, passengers are becoming extremely frustrated by their inability to use this service. People who cannot get on a <Col N="1225" /> train often cannot get on the next train either. The form of DART rage we are experiencing along that line will lead to injuries because of the present inadequacy of the service. The problem has been compounded recently by the frequent appearance of notices on the boards stating the next train is delayed because of staff shortages. That problem must be dealt with so that an efficient service is provided.</P>
      <P>The national plan tells us that 46 extra DART carriages will be provided over the next seven years. That is not enough and it is taking too long to provide them. Even if 46 extra carriages were provided now, they would not be sufficient to meet both the current growing demand for the DART service and the additional demand which will be generated when the service is extended to Greystones. We need urgent action to provide additional carriages and extra DART services.</P>
      <P>In addition, action must be taken to improve the management of the DART stations, many of which are not staffed after 9 p.m. They are dark, forbidding places which people are reluctant to use at night, particularly if they are travelling alone. That should not be the case. The management of the DART stations should be given a much higher priority and efforts should be made to combine this with the provision of other commercial services in and around DART stations in order to physically upgrade the stations, provide some life in them and provide a sense of safety for DART passengers, particularly at night.</P>
      <P>I appeal for immediate action to be taken to improve what was, up to recently, a high quality service but which, unfortunately, due to increased demand combined with the inadequacy of the service and the shortage of carriages, is becoming a poor and dangerous service. That should be rectified immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate. In the greater Dublin area, traffic congestion has replaced crime as the key concern for ordinary people. The difficulty being experienced in getting to and from work, school and shops is exasperating for everyone. Dublin is effectively gridlocked throughout the day and the term &ldquo;rush hour&rdquo; is no longer relevant. Gridlock is having a detrimental effect on the city's environment. Consultants have estimated it costs Dublin in excess of a staggering £1 billion per annum, with particular reference to accidents, pollution, noise, absenteeism etc., most of which are caused by road traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that action is required to attract people away from cars and on to public transport. Part of the motion before the House refers to the need to increase State subsidies to Dublin Bus, and I have always been in favour of this proposal as it would be cost-effective in the long term. Government support for public transport in Dublin over the years has been the lowest of any <Col N="1226" /> European capital city. In Athens the figure is 50 per cent, it is 39 per cent in Barcelona, 58 per cent in Paris, 74 per cent in Rome, 46 per cent in Strasbourg, 15 per cent in London, but only 6 per cent in Dublin. I hope the Minister is satisfied that we are at the bottom of the heap. His comments to the House on increased subsidies for public transport do not deal with the neglect of recent years. These are remarkable statistics at a time when the Minister is giving the impression that he wishes to encourage the public away from private transport and on to public transport. For a trial period the Minister should authorise substantial reductions in the fare structures of trains and buses, and increase the State subsidy accordingly. This policy of greater subsidisation for economic and social reasons would encourage more people to use buses and trains instead of private transport.</P>
    <P>I will highlight some of the issues raised by the Irish Cabdrivers Association at a recent meeting with Labour Party Deputies. Statutory Instrument SI 316/99 raises a number of legitimate concerns for hackney drivers. The instrument states that no documents or signs referring to the licensing or operation of a vehicle as a hackney shall be displayed within a vehicle. This is totally unacceptable and the Minister should amend the instrument to require the holders of hackney licences to display identification, licences and authorisations internally in the vehicle, similar to taxis. This measure is vitally important for the security of passengers.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the requirement to keep a record of fares but I have difficulty with the requirement to take and record the names of passengers. There is a need to allow hackneys, as public service vehicles with suitable external identification, to use bus lanes for the Christmas period. For the past two weeks, hackney drivers have taken to the streets to protest at what they see as unacceptable and discriminatory regulations. As we approach Christmas, and in the interest of the general public, I appeal to hackney drivers not to proceed with this action. However, the Minister should listen to their legitimate concerns and meet them in the near future to discuss these matters and bring them to a satisfactory conclusion. That is the way to deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>Two groups of people are seriously affected by the inadequate public transport system. I specifically refer to the inadequacies of Dublin Bus services. Those people who cannot afford private transport are totally dependent on the system. The second group includes those who can afford private transport but who are constantly being encouraged to use public transport to reduce the volume of traffic and the dreadful gridlock which has become part of our daily lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are dependent on public transport <Col N="1227" /> have no other available transport system. They are unable to get to and from work, they may depend on public transport to travel to and from school, and they cannot afford to hire a taxi to get to a hospital or other emergency services. Many elderly people are entirely dependent on public transport to go shopping, to get into town, to visit a health centre or doctor, or to access what to them are essential services like a post office. These people frequently wait for unspecified lengths of time for the next bus to arrive. They wait at bus stops where there is inadequate shelter, if any at all, and do not know how long it will be before the next bus will arrive. Almost every European city includes in its transport system a facility to inform those waiting of the approximate length of time before the next service arrives. At a minimum, such information, which could reasonably be made available at every bus stop electronically, should be provided. The frequency of the arrival of buses is a major concern on many routes. If people are expected to use public transport they need to be able to depend on a frequent and reliable service.</P>
    <P>There is also a difficulty obtaining prepaid tickets. The Dublin South-Central constituency has an adult population of more than 70,000, but only 17 retail outlets which sell prepaid tickets. The irony is that people who need to use these tickets have to get a bus or drive to a location to buy them. It is also of considerable annoyance that bus users can only obtain change for their fare by bringing their ticket stub to the Dublin Bus offices in O'Connell Street. While the exact fare policy speeds up the service, there should be many more collection points at which people can cash in their ticket stubs.</P>
    <P>The second group being encouraged to use public transport are those being asked to use the park and ride facilities. However, the problem is the singular absence of such facilities. The Government must ensure the provision of an adequate number of suitably located facilities as a top priority. Only through such practical developments can we hope to have a transport system which can be used, thus helping to reduce the appalling level of traffic chaos we are experiencing on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Bus fares should be reduced to encourage more users, but this means that the Government subsidy should be significantly increased. At present, the value for money element for the bus user is not sufficient to prompt anyone who does not absolutely have to do so, to put up with the inconvenience of the system. There are too many negatives to expect the paying customer to tolerate the hassle. I welcome the proposal to increase the subsidy for Dublin Bus and any other incentives required to improve the service which is urgently in need of updating, and to encourage users to <Col N="1228" /> avail of a genuine public service offering value for money.</P>

      <P>Eight years ago the Dublin Transportation Initiative, of which I was a member, in consultation with the Government, drew up a comprehensive programme for traffic management and the development of public transport in Dublin. Cruelly, eight years later we are still waiting for the introduction of some of those key initiatives. Eight years ago the Labour Party presented a draft outline of the Luas network to the European Commission but we are still trying to plan that project. During the rainbow coalition's period in office, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, played a significant role in holding up the development of Luas by going back on commitments he made when in Government with the Labour Party, thus setting back the debate by three or four years. Unfortunately, everything is coming home to roost. I commend the modest progress made in the past six to nine months in the planning of Luas, particularly since the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, appointed the Luas committee under Padraig White, a colleague of mine on the Northside Partnership. However, there are still fundamental problems. I have the national development plan here and it does not mention a Luas line for the northside, even though Dublin Airport caters for 12 million passengers a year and is overtaking Manchester Airport, and 450,000 people live in the northside, including in the growing town of Swords, represented by my colleague, Deputy Seán Ryan. The Minister has not made any provision for the northside in the next five years. The southside is catered for by two lines but where there is clearly a definitive need, to serve the airport and workers in the north west of the city, the Minister has done nothing. This is discrimination against deprived areas.</P>
      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, on his comments on the DART network. Fortunately, there are six stations in my constitutency. However, the situation is so dangerous at the moment that all that is needed is for the Minister to permit Japanese-style attendants, several heavy gentlemen who will push the people on to the trains and cram them in like sardines. It is extremely dangerous and Deputy Gilmore is right that it is a disgrace. The national development plan contains provisions for 46 additional cars and perhaps eight trains. This is a drop in the ocean&mdash;</P>

      <P>Absolutely. It is a contemptu<Col N="1229" /> ous reaction to the 1.3 million commuters in Dublin who depend, in greater or lesser part, on the DART. Instead of expanding the network, the Minister is, in a mealy-mouthed way, giving us a small extension. As another colleague said, the Government seems to be in chaos on the linking of the Luas tunnel. We will have to have some kind of link. The original idea was that it would go from Harcourt Street to Broadstone. We were then promised a link from Heuston Station to Connolly Station, which is an obvious suggestion. However, we do not know from where the funding will come &ndash; it does not seem to be provided for in the national development plan. The possibility of consultations with the Japanese Mitsui Bank on a public private partnership was mentioned in passing. The Taoiseach has been thinking about these matters for the past five years and fundamental decisions have not been made.</P>
      <P>One of the banes of my life, as a representative of a constituency on the DART line, is that we have no park-and-ride facilities. Villages like Raheny, Sutton, Bayside and Howth are becoming more clogged up with people travelling by car from the north west of the city to use the DART network. Unfortunately, they are jamming up residential areas and streets. The Minister is providing 3,700 spaces which does not seem adequate. As Deputy Callelly said, the Government played cruel games as regards the provision of taxis in this city. A few years ago, we were arguing about 150 taxis, then when the Government returned to power it was 850 and tonight the figure was 5,800. I wonder if some taxi drivers will be joining anti-racism groups outside Deputy Callelly's clinic on Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>We need a dramatic improvement in the Government's attitude to public transport in this city.</P>

      <P>I welcome the £2.25 billion included in the national development plan for the development of public transport. There is a significant difference between the action taken by this Government and that taken until it entered office. I welcome the opportunity to discuss areas outside Dublin which need attention in future plans. It is significant that there is a reasonably high expenditure on public transport in Dublin because of its population and the effect on other parts of the country. However, I wish to highlight the service in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the developments in e-commerce which are leading people to take up employment outside Dublin, there is a need to extend an efficient public transport service throughout the country. I am pleased that under the development of the <Col N="1230" /> regions section of the national plan, a sum of £12 million has been set aside for the development of a public transport service. In the overall expenditure and the development of the regions, attention should be given to areas experiencing huge growth, like Carlow and Kilkenny. The long promised and long awaited commuter service for these centres should be considered. A considerable number of people living in Dublin commute daily to Kilkenny. There are many decentralised offices there and the number of people employed in them is growing, thanks to other Government policy. I hope that in line with this development, these people and those conducting their business in the capital will be able to avail of a proper commuter service. The old railway stations should be modernised. These developments will put us at the cutting edge of public transport in the EU.</P>
    <P>Significant developments have taken place but, given the demand of the marketplace and the public's desire for efficient public transport, huge investment will be necessary, not just what is outlined in the national plan. We must continue to monitor the changes taking place in public transport and the finance required. If a proper transport system was available, it would eliminate some of the difficulties in growing urban areas. For example, I would like to see a proper transport system in Kilkenny, serving the region as well as the county. This would remove a volume of traffic from the city centre and the medieval centre of Kilkenny, which would result in freeing up roads. With the development of Belview Port in Waterford, there is a need to ensure a more efficient flow of traffic throughout the region.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are experiencing problems in planning routes, particularly ring roads. Carlow is an example of the problems which can be caused by the lack of public transport. If a proper system was in place for commuters, we would have less need for a super highway from Kildare to Kilkenny. Perhaps a ring road would be the best solution, as has been the case for many areas. The proposed route 18 is being strongly opposed by the people of Carlow. This should be examined and a proper service for commuters established instead. This would ensure the effect on the environment would be kept to a minimum. Carlow is one of the smallest counties in the country and a super highway cutting farms in two, three and four is unacceptable. It is up to us, as legislators, to ensure this transport policy is applied outside Dublin and takes the regions into consideration. I appeal to the Minister and the Department to interract with other Departments to ensure developments, such as that in Carlow, are halted until a proper public transport structure is put in place.</P>
    <P>A strong emphasis has been put on the development of e-commerce. Encouragement of this will be linked to the proper development of public transport. If there is a good public trans<Col N="1231" /> port system in place, we can ensure that the remainder of the country enjoys the growth in the development of e-commerce. People will no longer have to be at the centre of things in Dublin or other urban centres, they will be able to commute to their jobs. That underlines the need for development in this area.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the work undertaken and the money expended on public transport. However, I would ask that the remainder of the country be considered as a matter of urgency so that it can enjoy the growth in the economy and the positive steps being taken by the Government to ensure this continues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As successive Governments have not spent sufficient money on public transport, I am pleased the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has made a commitment in the national development plan to invest more money in that area. As a rural Deputy, I am interested in the regional public transport issue. I particularly welcome the fact that £500 million is to be invested in mainline rail. The Dublin/Galway railway line has often been mentioned as being in serious need of investment. Last year there was investment in the Galway/Ballinasloe section of that line and I look forward to improvements in the remainder of the Galway/Dublin rail link in the years to come.</P>
      <P>Many of the Opposition demands this evening are dealt with in the national development plan. In relation to the bus network, I am pleased that proposed local routes will complement the existing radial network. I welcome the purchase of 275 additional buses to increase passenger capacity and meet the requirements of the network. I welcome also the bus replacement programme and the decision to provide new equipment. Reference was made to the additional park and ride facilities and integrated public transport ticketing. The park and ride facilities will be relevant in the case of Galway where there are serious traffic problems in the city and suburbs. There is a great need for this facility. Oranmore has been mentioned as a suitable town for this type of development. I regret that development in Galway took place too quickly with the result that the road developments were not given priority, particularly the feeder routes out of the city. However, Galway is fortunate to have a railway station in the centre of the city. For that reason, the rail links to Galway should be developed, particularly that from Tuam to Galway. There is a line from Athenry to Galway in use as part of the Dublin/Galway line. Upgrading of the Tuam to Galway line would be of great benefit. Other railway lines are needed from south Galway to deal with the traffic congestion into the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a brief comment on quality bus corridors mentioned in the Fine Gael motion. In other European countries and in the United States special lanes are made available for taxis and people car pool or car share. We should look seriously at this. The traffic management <Col N="1232" /> measures must cater for disabled people and the needs of mobility impaired persons. I was pleased to hear recently that Galway Corporation has issued six new licences for wheelchair accessible taxis. These taxis should be available at all times for the disabled. Further taxi licences for the disabled should be issued by all local authorities.</P>
    <P>On the question of transport by bus, the House will be aware that major roadworks are taking place throughout the country at present. This is certainly true on national primary and secondary routes, but also on other regional routes. In some cases this is leading to traffic jams with the result that buses cannot meet their schedules. Traffic diversions should be put in place rather than closing down lanes. For example, last week just one lane was in operation at Enfield. This led to serious delays of up to one and a half to two hours. People using these buses were late for appointments. This was particularly difficult for people with medical appointments. Some people would take alternative routes to Dublin if they were informed on time that traffic problems lay ahead.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to earmark four new buses for Galway city services before the end of the year and the provision of £3 million for pilot rural transport projects in the national development plan. This is most welcome because in recent years Bus Éireann has been extending its rural services in conjunction with local community groups. It has also been developing low cost rural transport services. In many cases this is done by using the school bus or a private school bus operator on contract to Bus Éireann. This has led to a very cost-effective system which takes account of the particular needs of the local community. The passengers concerned, for example, can attend a day care centre or visit libraries or the post office, etc. Some services are arranged so that pensioners and social welfare recipients can visit the local post office and the bus waits for them. This is the best service of all. In many instances the general public depend on the regular Bus Éireann routes. In this context, I suggest that Bus Éireann consider making more stops on its routes. I have written to the Minister concerning a stopping point in the villages of Kilreekill and Cappataggle in County Galway to enable people to visit Ballinasloe, Loughrea and Galway city. The Dublin/Galway bus would be the most obvious to make these stops. I understand this matter will be investigated by Bus Éireann and the Garda in the Galway area.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that £2.2 billion is being allocated to public transport. That is a significant amount to invest in public transport. The Minister stated that this would provide a one-third increase in commuter seats during peak hours in the greater Dublin area. This indicates the success of the Minister in her efforts to obtain funds and I hope the investment will be of great benefit to those who use public transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to the <Col N="1233" /> motion. The Fine Gael motion portrays the party's usual preoccupation with problems inside the Pale. This is the second time this year we are debating this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister has demonstrated her intent to address these problems throughout the country. We will all enjoy first class transport systems and roads in the new millennium. The Government has made a commitment to provide massive funding for all our national and non-national roads and for the total rail infrastructure. Change cannot take place overnight. There are at least one and a half million vehicles on our roads at present and this figure continues to increase. New vehicle sales records are at an all time high. We face traffic chaos in all our major cities.</P>
      <P>Over the next seven years, the plan for an extensive upgrading of our national primary routes will ensure that traffic jams will cease to be a persistent problem. In that context, I am sure Members will give enthusiastic support to the Minister's proposals and not adopt a tunnel vision approach to them. I hope Members will share her clearly stated determination to tackle the transport and roads issue. The Minister is fully committed to a first class public transport system. She has already asked for and received the review of the medium term investment needs of CIE for both bus and rail services. Her decision to seek complementary funding for an improved public transport system which will benefit from the new roads infrastructure is a wise and prudent strategy. Those in opposition who criticise this approach would be well advised to consider their own non-performance in these related matters. Everyone has heard of the hurlers on the ditch and, judging by their performances tonight, a number of Members on the Opposition benches should get together to form an All-Ireland hurling team for next year.</P>
      <P>Opposition Members cannot deny that the decision to give the public transport system a cash injection of £2.2 billion during the next seven years is timely. Neither can they deny that we will spend almost £2 million per day on our roads or that there will be a total investment of £4.7 billion. These are the facts. All the criticism in the world cannot diminish the commitment and dedication of the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>During the summer, Deputy Coveney and I submitted a plan for an improved public transport system in the greater Cork area. A great deal of work was invested in the preparatory stages of our plan and we spoke to a number of representatives and organisations. In that context, we had lengthy discussions with Cork Corporation, Cork County Council, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann, the Garda, Cork Chamber of Commerce and many other interested parties. This process of across the board consultation should ensure that the problems we face in Cork are clearly identified and quantified. This was the only route we could take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our joint submission to the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise was accepted and included <Col N="1234" /> in the public transport investment priorities for the millennium report which was published in the past two weeks. Furthermore, I made submissions to the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Taoiseach and am delighted the national development plan reflects the thrust of my input. Among the proposals I put forward are the computer control of Cork city and its environs, the upgrading of its roads, the expansion of the bus fleet and the introduction of a replacement programme. We have already received 16 new buses this year, with a further four to follow in the near future, and a substantial number will be provided in the year 2000. This is still not adequate but at least we are making progress. I proposed the upgrading of facilities at main bus stops, the provision of extra rail cars for Iarnród Éireann, the modernisation of the signalling system and recommended the provision of four new suburban stations. The proposal that a feasibility study be carried out into the possibility of establishing a light rail system on the southside of Cork city was the brainchild of Deputy Coveney.</P>
    <P>These and many other suggestions were made by everyone who participated in our discussions. All of these initiatives will be among the final set of proposals which will put an end to our local problems. We cannot continue to ignore the traffic logjams that frequently occur in our city. Unfortunately, the delays these cause are partly due to the provision of new road structures. I ask that the funds being made available this year for next year's programme under the terms of the national development plan be passed on to the relevant local authorities as soon as possible, otherwise we may find that one part of the solution will create its own set of problems.</P>
    <P>Advances resulting from improved roads and transport facilities will have a major impact on our daily lives. The benefits in the saving of travel time on road and rail are obvious. The accompanying health benefit of less stressful travel is more difficult to quantify but it is an obvious bonus. Another factor to which previous speakers referred is the time lost in transporting goods through a choked city road network. Improved surfaces on our highways will mean that there will be less wear and tear on vehicles, with an accompanying saving in maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>I could continue to speak on this subject at length but I will conclude by highlighting the main transport plans for the Cork region. The national development plan provides £50 million for the upgrading of public transport in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, £75 million to replace 450 buses in the Bus Éireann fleet and £12 million to upgrade the regional transport system.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister and the Government for upgrading rail services in Cork and providing additional moneys for the city's bus fleet and I welcome her regional transport policy which was outlined in the national development plan.</P>

      <P>All Dublin Deputies agree on one thing, namely, that the city has come to a standstill. It comes to a standstill early in the morning, during the day and late at night. However, it must be noted that it has come to a standstill for those who still use private transport. The DART, quality bus corridors and the bus service work, but not for long enough, not early enough, not late enough and not for enough people. I welcome the investment that has already been made in this area and the allocation, in the national development plan, of £2.2 billion to be spent on public transport. This investment is needed in a wide variety of ways.</P>
      <P>My constituency is very fortunate in that the people who live there have access to a number of DART stations. However, as previous speakers stated, DART carriages are overcrowded to such an extent that people become light headed or faint. The large numbers using the DART are in danger because they are not being provided with adequate facilities. Encouraging people to use the DART is creating further problems because we are saying &ldquo;Bring your car as far as the DART station, abandon it wherever you like and take the train&rdquo;. The parking areas provided at stations are inadequate. The Government has not taken any responsibility for this because DART stations are situated in residential areas. Parking cars in the vicinity of DART stations is a nightmare for local residents and there is an urgent need to improve the feeder bus system from housing estates to DART stations to ensure that the numbers of cars abandoned in residential areas decreases.</P>
      <P>The Minister has promised to provide an additional 46 carriages, at a cost of £53 million, for the DART. The sooner the better this happens because an accident will otherwise occur and people will lose faith in the DART. This will undermine the entire public transport system.</P>
      <P>That we cannot have a single integrated ticket makes me question the equipment, the technology and the willingness of the companies to adapt. People are obliged to buy a ticket when they get on the bus, another when they take the DART and possibly a second bus ticket when they alight from the train. I agree with calls for the immediate introduction of an integrated ticketing system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates earlier made a jest about Foxrock church. He should not have done so because the church provides a useful facility for approximately 200 people to park their cars each morning before they catch the bus.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Problems only arise at the church when people arrive in their cars with a view to parking them and taking the bus and they are greeted by a large sign saying &ldquo;Funeral today, no parking&rdquo;. Where do those people go then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time the councils, the Departments and the various bodies negotiated with the church auth<Col N="1236" /> orities in Foxrock and Dalkey and on the Merrion Road because these churches have large car parks. At present, they are providing a service but receiving nothing in return. Perhaps there is a way in which the groups to whom I refer can work together.</P>
    <P>The DART, the buses and the bus corridors are designed to help transport members of the public into town. They travel in by public transport and are abandoned late at night. What do we do then? We blame the taxi drivers who will not take them home. I welcome the Minister's announcement that extra taxis, which are much needed, will be provided immediately. Even I was amused by the Government's amendment to the motion which stated that we will introduce more taxis &ldquo;progressively&rdquo; and &ldquo;as quickly as possible&rdquo;. I felt that those two phrases did not tally and I am delighted the Minister has pre-empted my words and announced the immediate provision of additional taxis.</P>
    <P>When these taxis arrive on our streets, their owners should be made to work. Taxis should be available, day and night. When I got off the train in Limerick recently on my way to visit the regional hospital I had no trouble getting a taxi. I asked the driver how I could organise one for the return journey and he informed me that I would not be able to because the taxi drivers were going off to have their tea, have a few drinks and watch the match. Either taxi drivers provide a service or they do not. If they obtain licences on the understanding that they will provide a service, they must be made to provide it regardless of what sporting event is taking place.</P>
    <P>Buses are of major importance throughout Dublin city for three reasons. First, the phrase &ldquo;school bus&rdquo; is an oxymoron. There is no such thing in Dublin. I have referred previously in the House to the Booterstown triangle, which comprises Merrion Avenue, Booterstown Avenue and the Rock Road. It is a small area which contains five first level schools, three second level schools and two third level colleges. At the same time every morning thousands of students clog up the public transport system because all of them are dropped at the same place. Buses are full on the Clonkeen Road but are empty when they reach Booterstown. It is time to facilitate a private bus scheme or to provide school buses in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>A second issue relating to buses is the lack of local routes. It is virtually impossible to get from Ballybrack to Loughlinstown Hospital, which is only a stone's throw away. If one was in the whole of one's health, one could walk there but most people attending the hospital are not in the best of health and must take a circuitous route to get there. These are small things which mean a great deal and a proper service should be provided in such communities. The Dún Laoighaire-Rathdown local authority area stretches, mar a deir siad fhéin, ó chuan go sliabh. A person has no hope of travelling from the cuan to the sliabh on public transport. If, say, a person lives in Black<Col N="1237" /> rock and works in Dundrum, he must get a bus into the city centre and another out to Dundrum if he starts early in the morning. There is also poor provision of circular routes. Dún Laoighaire Chamber of Commerce is examining these issues but they should be considered in the overall context of public transport.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Chamber of Commerce has asked who is in control, and that is a fair question. The director of traffic is in charge of traffic but that is not the only problem. Last week, there was an hour and a half tailback in Enfield, County Meath, because of roadworks. There is a tailback in Johnstown, County Kilkenny, today because of tree cutting. Some days there are no taxis in Dublin city centre because all of them are stuck in Dublin Airport. These problems relate to traffic, roads, the environment and parks but who is in control? This question needs to be answered because one body must co-ordinate the various elements involved.</P>
    <P>As Christmas approaches there are obvious problems. Initiatives were announced which will begin tomorrow. Dublin Bus will provide the Nitelink service and park and ride facilities will also be provided. I welcome the park and ride facility at Simmonscourt but it is in the wrong location. If one reaches Simmonscourt, one is practically in the city centre, having battled along the Rock Road. Perhaps, in future, negotiations will be undertaken with UCD which has a large amount of parking space that could be utilised. Students do not need the space early in the morning. People could then avail of the quality bus corridor to get into the city centre. A total of two ranks for the shared taxi initiative is not enough. Taxi drivers are the only people who will gain. The service will not begin until late at night. Do people have the right to refuse to share with people who are too drunk, spaced or sick?</P>
    <P>Santa has made a special request that he should be given a dispensation for himself and his reindeers to use the quality bus corridors on Christmas Eve or he will never get his gifts delivered.</P>

      <P>I refer to public transport concerns outside the Dublin area and I thank Deputies Yates and Mitchell for their work in highlighting public transport problems in Ireland. I am encouraged that Deputy O'Flynn is so confident that the Minister will implement everything that we have asked for in Cork, in terms of public transport. However, it is hard to be as optimistic as he is when one examines the Government's abysmal record there over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traffic congestion and other transport related problems seriously impede the quality of life of <Col N="1238" /> citizens in Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Cork, but I will concentrate on the latter. Unlike other parts of the country, Cork has planned and provided for growth quite well from an infrastructural point of view. An integrated land use and transportation study has been pursued since the late 1970s resulting in the expenditure of more than £300 million, much of it from the EU, to complete a ring road around the city and the Lee Tunnel. However, the public transport aspect of the LUTS, which should have been financed by various Governments, has not been implemented. Recognising this, a report entitled &ldquo;Cork Public Transport Investment Review&rdquo; was recently completed by a group comprising representatives of Cork Corporation, Cork County Council, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Eireann and the Garda, all of which must deal with traffic congestion on a daily basis in the city. The proposed expenditure in respect of this is £36 million, which is not a high price to pay when one considers that it would mean that traffic and congestion problems would be brought under control in Ireland's second largest city by providing a proper public transport service in terms of bus and rail.</P>
    <P> The bus fleet needs most immediate attention. Buses in Cork city are between 12 and 14 years old. Some buses which brought me into the city centre when I was a teenager are still used today. This will hardly encourage people to leave their cars at home and take the bus instead. If we are serious about promoting the use of buses as an alternative to cars, a modern bus fleet that is accessible to everybody must first be provided. Bus Éireann cannot provide the efficient, clean and punctual service required if it does not have the buses to do so. A total of £10.2 million must be spent on fleet acquisition in Cork, thus increasing the number of buses from 63 to 83. The seven or eight new buses acquired this year replaced old buses which were ready for the scrapheap.</P>
    <P>New routes are desperately needed to service areas that have experienced massive population growth. Towns, such as Carrigaline and Ballincollig, are classic examples of satellite towns where population has increased dramatically but which are still served by the same bus routes. I often ask Bus Éireann to provide extra routes but they ask me to show them the buses because if I did, they would provide the routes. The Minister is the only person who can provide buses.</P>
    <P>Investment is necessary for park and ride facilities. Cork is perhaps the most glaring example, other than Dublin, of a centre which would benefit from such a system. The city is surrounded by a ring road and most problems occur inside it as traffic tries to enter and exit the city centre. If proper parking facilities were provided on the outskirts of the city, people would park their cars and take a bus to the city centre along a quality bus corridor. There is proof that Cork people will avail of park and ride facilities. On Saturday mornings a successful and busy park and ride system is in place on the south side of the city but it <Col N="1239" /> cannot be implemented during week days because resources are not available. Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann are willing to implement new systems but lack of resources is a problem. The Government announced that it will spend a great deal in this area but I will not believe it until I see the benefits on the railways and the streets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the short time available to me, I make no apologies for being parochial. There are two growth areas in my constituency, one near Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, and the other in Lucan, and I am told on good authority that more houses are being built in those areas than in any other comparable area in the European Union. One might expect me to receive complaints about housing or social welfare, but I receive more complaints about traffic than any other issue.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, people in Dublin 15 are extremely lucky because a railway line goes through that part of the constituency on the Connolly to Maynooth route. The solution to the traffic problems of the area is the existence of the railway line. The chairman of CIE is on record as saying with regard to proposals for development that it is the best value for money proposal in the entire country. However, the reality is total under-utilisation The service is extremely poor. The timetable for 2000 shows that only 24 trains will run on weekdays, 17 on Saturdays and there will be no trains on Sundays or bank holidays. This is total under-utilisation of the service. We are aware of difficulties on the DART but one can imagine the situation when there is unlikely to be trains for three days over Christmas and four days around the new year on the railway line through the constituency.</P>
      <P>There is no train from Connolly station between 5.52 p.m. and 9 o' clock. There is a wait of three hours and eight minutes if one misses the train at 5.52 p.m. The result is overcrowding and I have raised the consequent dangers of that on a number of occasions. I previously raised the danger of overcrowding particularly on the 8.05 a.m. train which is invariably late. It is packed before it reaches Coolmine, Clonsilla and Castleknock and people cannot get on. I also highlighted a recent case at Tara Street station where a blind man, his dog and his blind wife were forced off the platform. People are forced together like sardines and there are no safety standards in operation. This is scandalous and should be dealt with urgently.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision made 16 months ago to reallocate funding which was originally earmarked for the Luas project to this line. I also welcome the work which has been done since, but there is already a double line between Connolly station and Clonsilla. Why is this not being utilised to provide more trains and reduce the dangerous overcrowding to which I referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the development plan contains no proposals for the extension of the <Col N="1240" /> railway line to the Blanchardstown town centre where it could then be further extended to serve the new institute of education and on to Dublin Airport. If there were such a facility from Connolly to Maynooth, one would reasonably think that it would be utilised to the fullest extent and that a new branch would be developed to cater for the Dublin 15 area, including the new town centre at Blanchardstown and beyond where the population is approaching 100,000 and is likely to reach 120,000 within the next five years. However, apparently, that will not be the case and I am greatly disappointed that it is not included in the development plan. A forward looking, progressive Minister would have thought in those terms and seized that opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a number of points in relation to traffic and transportation difficulties in my constituency of Laois-Offaly. I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Yates, on his call for a White Paper on public transport. It is essential that the way is cleared for the preparation and publication of such a paper at the earliest opportunity because it is clear that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has no vision of the needs of the people with regard to public transport into the next century.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the rail service and the lack of public transport along a north-west south-east axis in my constituency. The attitude of Iarnród Éireann to commuters in the midlands, with particular reference to the towns of Tullamore, Clara, Portarlington and Portlaoise, is to be deplored. Iarnród Éireann has been strangled by the Minister. These towns dispatch over 1,000 commuters each morning to Dublin and they return home each evening tired, frustrated and annoyed with the service currently being provided. To add insult to injury, Iarnród Éireann recently reformed its timetable which resulted in a reduced evening service to Portlaoise and added a further 20 minute delay to return travel time on this run from Dublin which should take 55 minutes.</P>
      <P>This is outrageous at a time when Dublin city is choked with traffic and policies are supposedly being introduced by the Government to provide incentives or invitations to people to use other forms of public transport. Iarnród Éireann, because of the treatment of commuters in the midlands, is forcing people by the hundreds into their cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 2,000 houses under construction in Portlaoise. These will be completed within the next 18 months and there is massive development in Mountmellick, Portarlington and Stradbally. Many owners and occupiers of these houses work in Dublin and their ideal choice of transport to work is by rail. Unfortunately, the Government is turning its back on these consumers by its total failure to provide visionary proposals to Iarnród Éireann. The Minister in reply to parliamentary questions said she has no responsibility. She is prepared to wash her hands of the public trans<Col N="1241" /> port system. This is shameful on her part. I have received complaints from constituents that trains are overcrowded. They are late, cold in winter, hot in summer and dirty but the Minister stated that she has no official responsibility in this regard. There appears to be a total lack of accountability in Iarnród Éireann, a body which urgently needs to get its act together.</P>
    <P>There is no public transportation axis on a north-west south-east line at a time when regional policies should be developed to move industry and commercial developments away from the east coast. How can this be done if it is impossible to travel from one end of my constituency to another because there is no public transport? There is one bus, which probably travels once a week, from Deputy Yates's constituency to Deputy Perry's Sligo constituency and there is no rail service. One can only get a bus in my constituency if one is travelling to or from Dublin, although there is talk about the Government's attitude to move development away from the capital. I welcome the motion and I am pleased to contribute to the debate. I congratulate Deputy Yates on his initiative in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the motion. I wish to refer to the problem of buses which leave Navan full and fail to stop at Bus Éireann stops en route. Last week a number of people who were at Garlow Cross, three miles outside the town, contacted the local radio station to complain that buses did not stop there as they were full leaving the town. Transport across the length and breadth of the greater Dublin area and in the midlands is in crisis. There is not one bus shelter in Navan, Kells or any of the other towns in the county. Bus Éireann has refused consistently to provide access, even on a once a week basis, to villages across the northern end of the county.</P>
      <P>We are told that the train service will be reintroduced in Navan. That will be welcome. When does the Minister expect work to commence on that?</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago I had occasion to travel by rail to Wexford. One hour out from Connolly Station, I asked for a cup of coffee. The attendant said he had no hot water. I asked him for Coke. There was none. I asked him for orange juice. There was none. I asked him whether the Minister for Public Enterprise knew he was out. That is an indication of how bad is the service on our transport system. There is no heat on the trains. Passengers, including elderly people, are asked to tolerate freezing conditions. That is deplorable. One morning last week, travelling to the House, it took me 35 minutes to get from the top to the bottom of O'Connell Street. Transport in the capital, under this Minister, is a total shambles. Deputy Hanafin could well have been speaking from these benches, given her criticism of the service, which is diabolical, even in her constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available to me I <Col N="1242" /> would like to refer to some matters which are linked to the motion and which impinge on commuters travelling to Dublin from Wicklow. Over recent years the population of Wicklow has increased dramatically. It now stands at more than 100,000 with further large increases forecast in the immediate years ahead. There are two main routes into Dublin, the N11 in the east and the N81 in the west. The N11 is the busier of these and caters for a large number of commuters and industrial export and import linked traffic. To cater for the large population in the north-east of the county, many of whom work in Dublin, a DART line was provided to Bray. Following much effort and campaigning, the former rainbow Government gave the green light to have this service extended to Greystones. In July 1996 the European Commission approved assistance from the Cohesion Fund for this extension. In October 1996 the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications indicated that the DART service to Greystones would be operational by the end of 1998. There were some delays. However, it was anticipated that the latest start date would be late summer in 1999. We have now almost reached the year's end and service is still in the wrapper, and this despite the assurance given that the Department is closely monitoring the project to ensure maximum progress.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister of State with responsibility for tourism and sport to bring back the message to the Minister for Public Enterprise that monitoring has not worked. According to the Minister we can expect 16 new carriages for delivery in the coming year. The national development plan refers to the phased purchase of 46 additional DART cars and an increased DART capacity of 39 per cent at 7,400 additional places. This sounds very good, but I seriously question the ability of the Government to oversee these projects in view of the fact that, after two and a half years in office, the service to Greystones is not in operation. It is regrettable that the Chairman of Wicklow County Council, Councillor George Jones, who received much acclaim from all sides had, on his own initiative, to take on the role of mediator as the Department of Public Enterprise washed its hands of the affair. I question whether the political will or ability is there to address this difficulty.</P>
      <P>Traffic coming into Dublin on the N81 through Tallaght has increased in line with other areas. When roadworks were being carried out on the Naas dual carriageway much traffic crossed over from Saggart to use this route and continues to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Luas project on the Tallaght to Abbey Street line is due for completion in the winter of 2002. I note that the end terminal will be in the Square in Tallaght, in a constituency with which the Minister of State is familiar. Without going into the details of the various Luas reports, we should consider again the siting of this terminal. At present it takes more than one hour to get to the city centre from Tallaght. A huge proportion <Col N="1243" /> of the passengers in these cars would use the Luas service, but only if they have access and a parking facility. Having being held up in traffic in the Square at Tallaght a couple of Fridays ago I cannot envisage an end-of-line Luas terminal proving attractive here, even if there are multi-storey car parks. It should be positioned somewhere towards the Embankment, where commuters would have access to it. I am sure the Minister would agree that it is nonsensical to put a terminal in the middle of the Square.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly refer to taxis. One small point has been brought to my attention by constituents. It is the practice of what I am sure is a very small proportion of taxi drivers, on discovering that a fare has to go to the outskirts of the city, to make an excuse and refuse to take the passenger as it may entail a loss of income. It happens, and I would like to know whether the Minister has any plans to address this problem in a realistic manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome this motion, but it would appear that one has a greater chance of moving mid-evening traffic in the city centre than of moving the Minister to take action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed that we must move from cars to public transport. I congratulate my colleagues on bringing this motion before the House this evening. What is required is a change of mind-set. In order to encourage people to change from using their cars to public transport, we must be able to offer them a service that will enable them to get around safely, quickly, cheaply, on time and in comfort. Delays are unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Let me give some examples. When people get off in Dublin from the train from Cork, in order to get a bus they have to queue up and buy tickets. That should not be necessary. They should be able to buy the tickets at the point of departure in Cork, and likewise around the country. That is one example of people being delayed and inconvenienced unnecessarily, and discouraged from using public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should refer briefly to the need for public transport in my area as other Deputies have done. The train station in Cork badly needs to be upgraded and modernised. I understand that is to be done, but I ask the Minister to move quickly on the work. It has to be done soon or people will not use it. There is a major problem with parking in Cork at present. I have been in contact with Iarnród Éireann about this. It seems that 80 per cent of car parking spaces in Cork have been franchised out to corporate users. That means ordinary commuters cannot get a parking space. That is ridiculous. Iarnród Éireann has assured me it is going to get more spaces. I ask the Minister to call on Iarnród Éireann to find out what is going on. If people cannot park their cars they will not use the trains. In this the Year of the Elderly older people have a problem &ndash; they can<Col N="1244" /> not get on the buses because the steps are too high. Many of them cannot get on trains. It may sound simple, but for an older person with arthritis it is very serious, and it needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the train station at Midleton many times. The feasibility study on this has not even started. Will the Minister ensure the study gets under way and that no obstacle is put in the way? If this project goes ahead it has to be attractive to people if they are to be encouraged to use it. They have to be able to park their cars. I ask the Minister to look at that. It is important.</P>
    <P>If Frank Hall were around today, he would have a great time with taxis in Dublin. He would have a skeleton standing alongside the taxi rank with cobwebs. In his time he did that in connection with buses. Now there is a problem with taxis. One cannot get a taxi at peak hours. Do the drivers go off for their tea? The Government is talking about commitment and so on. I cannot understand why it does not accept this motion, which is very sensible, instead of bringing in a wishy-washy, soapy-watery amendment, welcoming this, noting that and doing nothing. It is time we had action. People are being discommoded and are getting angry. This is a national crisis so, to paraphrase Percy French, &ldquo;are you right, there, Minister, are you right?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The school transport service has been developed until recently without reference to the more general transport needs in local communities. In recent years Bus Éireann has begun to use a small number of school buses to provide a transport service in rural areas. However, in the main these buses have been used for a short time every day during the school year, resulting in high unit costs. This valuable resource is under used. Old age pensioners who have free travel passes are unable to use this facility due to the lack of public transport in many communities. Where possible, school buses should be used for rural services as this would maximise the use of these buses and encourage operators to invest in a higher standard of vehicle. A community transport service in rural areas could provide a range of services to meet the needs of local communities. Such a service could be developed as a voluntary-State partnership. Communities could identify their own needs, including bringing older people shopping, to the doctor and to day-care facilities and providing access for people with disabilities. Costs could then be spread over a wider range of users and this would contribute to the cost of the maintenance of the fleet. For such a service to become operable it is important for the State to provide funding to initiate such developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new approach is also required for the proposed new regional growth centres. While the Minister is planning major investment in the public transport system in Dublin there is little in the <Col N="1245" /> national development plan regarding public transport for other cities or new growth centres. The Minister's home town of Athlone has been designated a growth centre and has the potential for the development of public transport with four rail lines meeting in the centre of the town. Has the Minister given any consideration to the provision of a proper commuter service for the town which could easily service the towns of Castlerea, Roscommon, Ballinasloe, Longford, Mullingar and Tullamore. Athlone is already experiencing traffic jams on the roads entering the town from these locations. This story can be repeated in many other urban centres where the infrastructure is there but the foresight and imagination is not. People are commuting daily to Galway from counties Clare, Roscommon and Mayo and from Tuam. The rail line is there but still there is no commuter service to Galway city. Are we to continue to keep the focus on the provision of additional infrastructure in the capital, much of which is urgently required, but at the same time neglect other centres inevitably leading to further congestion and the further demand for infrastructural investment in Dublin. Dublin needs investment but continuing the current band-aid approach to public transport investment will not solve the problem. It will merely magnify the current chaos.</P>
    <P>The Government has more money than any previous Government but it is being spread around like confetti without a structured plan. Bus Éireann does not have the resources to provide a satisfactory service. Major towns are served by Bus Éireann but there is not a service for the villages along the routes. Buses pass through at speed. It is an express way or no way.</P>
    <P>There is serious overcrowding on our trains but the Government does nothing about this. I congratulate the Minister on upgrading the rail lines but this is only being done because serious safety implications forced her to do it.</P>

      <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Mitchell talk about the need for public transport. Early in September when the Stillorgan quality bus corridor was opened she and Deputy Owen were not simply running with the pack in opposition to it, they were leading it. There is no point in calling on the Government to do something about a problem and then, when the Government takes action, leading the rabble in criticising it.

      <P>The economy has been booming in recent years and one of the by-products of this is extra traffic. There is a great increase in car ownership and in tourism and leisure activities. The economy is booming. Dublin is a very old city and one cannot click one's fingers and have it absorb the great amount of new traffic. Traffic management and the enforcement of regulations help but one cannot wave a magic wand and make everything right. We must make it very clear that everyone cannot bring their cars into the city every day because an old city cannot absorb them.</P>
      <P>We must change people's attitudes. The DART and suburban rail services have always had a public image in Dublin while the bus did not, perhaps because it did not have a reputation as a good quality and reliable service. Quality bus corridors are necessary and we must stand up to the vested interests who complain about them. We all agree with QBCs in theory but objections inevitably surface at local level. It is difficult to get contractors, private businesses have headhunted some of the top local authority engineers and the project is meeting problems at all stages. This is the fault neither of the DTO nor of the Government because the one thing that is not lacking is money. We have invested millions in Luas and other aspects of public transport. I am in favour of Luas but often a greater effect can be gained by more modest spending on buses. Dublin Bus was provided with extra buses last year but more are needed. I am glad to see that 270 new buses are lined up for Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the debate that there is a cross-party consensus on the need for major investment in public transport and for a substantial improvement in the quality of public transport services. The challenges we are facing today arise from two main factors: the lack of investment in public transport by successive Governments over a long period, and the sheer pace and scale of economic growth and development in recent years.</P>
      <P>The national development plan has set out a coherent and comprehensive strategy for the development of public transport over the next seven years. The national plan provides for £1.6 billion in investment in the greater Dublin area, covering not only Dublin but Wicklow, Meath and Kildare. That programme provides for an integrated package of measures. A sum of £220 million will be spent on developing the bus service as the core of the public transport system. The objective is to develop a much denser and more effective bus network, comprising radial, orbital, local and feeder services. This includes the provision of better bus services to the development centres identified in the strategic planning guidelines and the provision of local services in those centres.</P>
      <P>A sum of £185 million will be spent on maximising the capacity of the existing suburban rail network. A contingency provision has also been included for the implementation of a longer term strategic rail programme. A study which will outline the shape of this programme is nearing completion. Some £430 million has been allocated to implement the surface element of the light rail network approved by the Government in May 1998. A contingency provision has been made for the underground section, on which geotechnical studies will be completed by the end of the year. A sum of £50 million has been allocated for integration measures &ndash; park and ride, integrated ticketing and public transport interchange. A sum of £200 million has been provided for traffic management measures, including five additional quality bus corridors. All of this strategy is based on the land use framework provided by the strategic planning guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national plan also set out a clear investment strategy for regional public transport, involving a capital expenditure of £650 million. Some £500 million of this will be spent on the mainline rail network, guaranteeing its place in the country's transportation system. Of this, £350 million will be spent on completing the five year railway safety programme and £150 million on upgrading and renewing the network. A total of £150 million will be spent on improving bus and rail services in the cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. Some £87 million is being allocated to replace the Bus Éireann fleet and to <Col N="1249" /> upgrade regional bus transport. A sum of £10 million is being provided to improve accessibility to existing public transport, where this is not being addressed elsewhere in the overall programme. Some £3.5 million is available for pilot rural transport initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Government has also taken a range of other initiatives to improve public transport. Implementation of the DTO short-term action plan is well under way and is increasing the capacity of the public transport system very significantly. The Government is providing very substantial Exchequer capital funding for public transport, something which was not done by previous Governments. The capital Estimate for 2000 is £235 million. The subvention for public transport will be increased by 6 per cent in 2000, well ahead of the rate of inflation. The Government has acted on the commitment given in the revised programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, in relation to the issue of taxi supply in Dublin by the announcement tonight of an increase of some 3,100 in the number of taxis in the Dublin taximeter area by the end of 2000. An urgent review of the regulation of the bus market has begun with a view to introducing competition in bus public transport in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish a Cabinet committee on infrastructure emphasises the importance which the Government attaches to the infrastructural investment. Transport will be a particular focus of that committee's deliberations. It sends the clearest possible signal of the Government's determination to improve the quality of the public transport system.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. I support the motion tabled by my colleagues Deputies John Bruton, Yates and Olivia Mitchell and, in particular, the part which refers to the franchising out of bus routes to the private sector where Bus Éireann is currently not providing a service. I strongly believe that service will have to be provided. Other speakers have referred to work carried out under the Road Transport Act, 1932, by the previous Government but we do not see any results under the present Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of areas in my constituency where Bus Éireann cannot provide the required service. Acres of housing is being provided, people are moving in, there are two-car families, no bus service and no provision for such a service. In one area after a long wrangle there was a promise from Bus Éireann to provide an Imp service, a feeder bus into the local Douglas village, but almost three years later management, Bus Éireann and the unions cannot come to an agreement to provide that service. We have the phan-<Col N="1250" /> tom bus stops in that area and no bus service. I am informed by the local Bus Éireann manager that the recommendations laid down by the Labour Court have again been rejected by the proposed operators of these buses.</P>
    <P>There are numerous routes around the country where buses which are full pass school children at the bus stops. The passengers that should be collected along the route are left standing because there is not an alternative bus service. A bus driver, with whom I spoke recently, said all the overtime he wants is available to him because there are not enough drivers. I read an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, written by Eamon Timmins, in which he described the Arrow service in Dublin and how the 9.25 a.m. train did not turn up one morning simply because the driver was not available so that passengers were asked to wait for the 10.45 a.m. train. That is the type of third level transport service that operates here. I live in this city three days a week, as do many others in the House. It is frustrating to be dependent on public transport. There is no direct public transport link to the airport. We are dependent on taxis. I am delighted to hear the announcement by the Government tonight and I hope it will increase the options available to visitors to the city. Until there is a transport link between the city centre and Dublin Airport we are going nowhere near providing a public transport service in the city. I strongly urge that such a service be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion on public tranport. One of the key challenges facing the Government is to develop a proper transport policy. It has abysmally failed, since coming to office, to realise the urgency of the issue and the huge impact it is having on the quality of people's lives throughout Ireland but particularly in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputies Yates and Olivia Mitchell for the way in which they have highlighted this issue over the past year and made a range of suggestions of policy initiatives which, if put into practice, would have made a difference. Unfortunately, most of them have not been taken up. The Government has been characterised by very slow action in seeing the problem and beginning to do something about it.</P>
      <P>Many of my constituents live in flats and apartments. They find that every day there is a new change in respect of traffic management outside their homes. Yellow lines and residential disc parking have been introduced and they have lost traditional parking spaces. This is inevitable in a city such as Dublin which is growing. The problem is that while these people have no places to park their cars they do not have the choice of a proper public transport system to which they can turn. This is one of the real problems. It is extremely unfair to put pressure on city dwellers when they are not being offered an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Northern Ireland peace process will increase the volume of tourist <Col N="1251" /> traffic into Dublin and the worldwide coverage of the setting up of the Assemly will boost the numbers visiting the entire country. What we will find is that many incoming tour operators will cover the North from Dublin and while this is welcome it will add a large amount of extra heavy traffic to an already gridlocked city. Dublin is virtually unique in Ireland in not having a single coach park for tourist buses. Many are forced to drive around the city aimlessly while waiting to pick up a tour, adding even further to the gridlock. This is another example of a very poor transport policy initiative. It causes problems throughout my constituency in the south inner city, yet no action has been taken to deal with it. Surely an initiative could have been taken at a time when there are increasing numbers of tourists and coaches in the city.</P>
    <P>It is clear that more urgent traffic measures are required to deal with the extra 1,000 cars coming onto the streets of Dublin every week. Traffic calming measures are far too slow and more money must be allocated here. Perhaps public service car parks should be opened up.</P>
    <P>What will parking be like over the Christmas? Will there be adequate spaces and should initiatives not be taken to ease the situation? While some people need their cars for work, many commuters would use public transport if a proper system was available. This is clear from the introduction of the QBC in Stillorgan where the number using public transport has dramatically increased. This must be replicated all over the city in an effective way. More park and ride facilities are also needed. It is ridiculous that there is no co-ordination between the Dublin authorities to ensure we have the kind of facilities we need. The QBCs have been introduced without them.</P>
    <P>The initiative on taxis is welcome, although it is happening very late. How many extra taxis will be available in the city? Many people have been put in danger at night because of the lack of taxis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. We are debating public transport in the absence of a proper public transport policy. Speaker after speaker has referred to the grossly overcrowded trains, the inadequate buses, from both a quality and quantity point of view, and the almost invisible service provided by taxis when they are most needed. We need a strategy not only from the Minister for Public Enterprise but from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government lasts for the next two years or so there will inevitably be a reshuffle and I call on the Taoiseach to appoint a Minister for Public Transport or, failing that, a Minister of State to take full charge of this hugely important area. Other Government colleagues also have a role to play. The Minister for Finance has promised a decentralisation programme. If it is implemented quickly people can be moved to provincial areas. This will help to resolve some of the huge urban sprawl problems. The Tánaiste and Minister for <Col N="1252" /> Enterprise, Trade and Employment must encourage flexible working hours to avoid the situation where 250,000 people travel to work in Dublin at the same time every morning. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government can do much more from a planning perspective to develop our regional and provincial centres.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Stanton's remarks on public transport in the east Cork area. The railway station at Midleton should be reopened along with the Midleton to Cork line and, I hope in the next century, the Cork to Youghal line. That is what the development of public transport is about. If we want to use the £2.8 billion effectively we must ensure that public transport is a reality in every townland in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no apologies for being parochial in saying a word for the beleaguered northsiders. We have bus lanes with no buses, no park and ride facilities, a minimal attempt at orbital buses and traffic lights that nobody knows what they are for and who they are guiding. There are no taxi ranks in any of the suburban towns from Malahide to Swords and Skerries because of rows in Dublin Corporation. Hackneys provide a good service but they cannot use the bus lanes, nor can they go to Dublin Airport to pick up passengers. A special ramp for people in wheelchairs and mothers with buggies was installed at Malahide railway station but it cannot be opened because of the lack of staff. It is a white elephant. Wheelchair accessible taxi licences have been issued but they are not being used for wheelchair users. A person might get a wheelchair taxi if he/she telephones from home but there is no chance of getting one home. A woman from the Centre for Independent Living told me she did not get home one morning until 4 o'clock. She had to traverse the city in her wheelchair in the middle of the night in winter trying to get a taxi.</P>
      <P>I quote from a description of travelling by train I received from a commuter. It says everything about a service which involves over 10,000 journeys every week from the commuter line in Balbriggan into Dublin city. People are crammed into trains like cattle. God only knows what will happen if there is a crash. It is called &ldquo;A Commuter's Tale&rdquo; and it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrive Malahide Station 9.05. Announcement that the 9.12 train is running 20 minutes late due to obscure problem in Drogheda. Wise travellers rush for the exits, more trusting suffer 20 minutes delay while reading about the billions to be invested in the railways by the year dot. A further announcement 20 minutes later. Train will not now arrive in Rush and Lusk, although we are standing in Malahide, for yet another 20 minutes. Remaining hordes, save a few, head for the exits. Just as the hordes have vacated, the 9.12 train, yes, the same 9.12 train, trundles in but does not stop. It did not appear any more crammed than usual, and <Col N="1253" /> would certainly have accommodated the few remaining passengers having managed to get rid of the rest. No wet leaves on the tracks this morning. Could it be that the engine is not powerful enough to pull any more passengers? Why were we not told the full story from the outset &ndash; train would be 20 minutes late but would be so full it would not accommodate any more bodies? The vacators, second lot, did not even have the pleasure of noting that the 9.12 train arrived and whizzed through their station but did not stop.</P>
    <P>Thirty five minutes later, that is, 20 minutes to Rush and Lusk plus 15 minutes to Malahide, the Belfast train makes unscheduled stop to pick up the trusting few who are then whisked into Connolly Station in luxury and style. Announcements apologise for the late running of the train due to etc., etc. Commuters must then walk from one end of Connolly to the other end in order to catch a DART to Pearse, which was the original destination. Mini consolation: many familiar faces on the DART among those who vacated Malahide Station. Arrive in the office confused and disorientated.</P>
    <P>Minister, you are presiding over some Mickey Mouse operation at present. Try it sometime. These billions will come too late for me.</P>
    <P>That says it all. It is what the Minister is presiding over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all my colleagues for their detailed contributions. They outline the realities of public transport in the country. I also thank the Labour Party and my colleagues in the Opposition for their support of the motion.</P>
      <P>I hope Ministers are listening to this debate because if they move away from their set piece roster of announcement after announcement they will have heard the reality of what people face in commuting terms. It includes overcrowding, lack of service, no competition, under-investment and a city and a group of cities becoming ever more paralysed by the lack of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> We are repeatedly told the mantra that the national development plan will solve all these problems. That is a myth. The plan is to be implemented over seven years. There are 1.5 million cars in the country and an extra 1,000 cars per week come on stream. We cannot wait seven years. There is no timetable for the implementation of the plan.</P>
    <P>With regard to taxis, why did we have to wait two and half years for Deputy Noel Ahern and Deputy Callely to be shafted? Why did the people of Dublin have to put up with a situation where a vested interest group was propped up politically in a disgraceful fashion? The announcement tonight is long overdue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome it, but it is a minimalist response. We will insist that this issue is dealt with head on. It cannot be delayed. There is no Minister for Transport and no Minister with responsibility for transport spoke in this debate. The Government is all over the place because different people have different responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The economic efficiency of the country is grinding to a halt because of traffic gridlock. For many commuters the rush hour now starts before 7 o'clock in the morning and in the evening it goes on past 7 o'clock. The quality of life for people living in larger urban areas speaks for itself, never mind the problems of rural transport and the gross deficiencies in the rail service, including inter-city services.</P>
      <P>Public transport is a public service. Public services are the responsibility of politics and politicians. We are determined to make this an election issue. This is the third Christmas this Government has presided over traffic paralysis. It is nearly time we moved on. We will make sure this is the key issue at the next election.</P>

      <P>Anyone who reads page 27 of the prospectus for Telecom Éireann, issued last June, can only draw the conclusion that KPN-Telia was of a different mind in relation to the strategy. This sets out clearly that Telia, for regulatory reasons concerning the merger with Telenor and its interests in the Irish market, was going to divest its stake. It was clearly set out that KPN-Telecom is not restricted from increasing its shareholding in the company to a level not exceeding 29.9 per cent. There was the facility for them in the short-term to increase it and take up to 5.9 per cent of Telia shares. There was the further prospect that after 18 months they could buy even more shares. I have trawled through the papers and newspaper clippings, yet nowhere have I found it stated that KPN intended to exit within six months. I also have confirmed the date of finalisation of the IPO as 7 July.</P>

      <P>Six months have not elapsed and Deputy Roche's barracking will not cover up what is a very serious issue. Reading page 26 of the prospectus I am deeply concerned that it is actually in the interests of KPN to let the average traded price, between 1 November 1999 and 31 January 2000, drop below the IPO price and they will pay less to the Government.</P>

      <P>That is what the paragraph under comsource clearly states. When I went to the website to see what KPN said about this, I found it interesting that there was no mention of investment in central or eastern Europe. It says the sole reason it is pulling out is that &ldquo;one of the key objectives pursued by KPN in relation to affiliated and associated companies is the exercise of <Col N="1258" /> effective management control which is not provided by the current investment in Eircom&rdquo;. That is its stated reason, not mine, on its Internet website as of yesterday. I want the Minister to clarify a number of specific points. When did she know it was likely that KPN would pull out? Did she know last June or last week? When did she or her officials know? Will she state clearly the nature of the clawback or top-up price mechanism? Will she state the position in regard to the senior staff, the top experts, who came from KPN and Telia to give credibility to Eircom? Will they all stay? Are they contractually obliged to do so?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister state that the Government will do everything possible to resist the take-over of Eircom? In the critical area of telecommunications investment for the future, it is unacceptable that a corporate board will decide, as part of its own investment strategy, the level of investment in Irish telecommunications infrastructure, which is more critical to our competitiveness than anything else. That is my biggest concern. While it may be in the interests of the shareholders&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;to make an extra quick buck in the short term through a take-over, it would be disastrous for the economy because we would be divesting control of 99 per cent of our infrastructure. In regard to the issue of future investment, it is essential that Eircom is in a strong position for a rights issue and to invest and grow. We all wish Eircom every success. I hope a strategic partner can be put in place for up to 30 per cent of the company, which will ensure that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter. Telecommunications are an essential part of any modern economy. It is a sector that has provided much employment and generated much wealth in our economy, particularly over the past decade.</P>
      <P>However, we must appreciate that we are now only at the beginning of the telecommunications revolution, a revolution which will develop and grow at an exponential rate over the coming years. It is imperative that Ireland is to the forefront of this development. To this end, it is right that this House expresses an interest in the key players which operate in the newly deregulated telecommunications market. That is the background to raising this issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The surprising decision by the telecom company KPN to sell its 21 per cent share in Eircom raises a number of key issues. I have no intention of using this issue as a political football or making unfounded claims about an important commercial company. However, I want the Minister to inform us of the impact of the KPN decision on future development of our telecommunications sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between them, KPN and Telia purchased 35 per cent of what was Telecom Éireann in 1996. <Col N="1259" /> The rationale behind this move was that these experienced companies would provide a strategic alliance which would enable Telecom Éireann to develop its telecommunications infrastructure and capacity in a rapidly changing market. Developments in the international telecommunications sector rendered Telia's shareholding anti-competitive and that company had signalled its intention to divest itself of its Eircom shareholding. Yesterday, news of KPN's intention to sell its Eircom shareholding was made public.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will outline the steps she has taken, or intends to take over the coming days, in the light of these new developments. Has she had discussions with the chairperson or board of Eircom? Specifically, has she raised the issue of the company's capacity to continue its expansion of telecommunications infrastructure after the departure of the strategic partners? In addition, has the Minister been in contact with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation? Is the Minister aware of any proposal by Eircom to source another strategic partner with the capital and technical know how to drive the expansion of the Irish telecommunications market forward? In addition, will the Minister inform the House of the status of the payment due to the Exchequer under the original contract of sale agreed in 1996, whereby the companies would make a final payment based on the trading price of the shares over a three month period?</P>
    <P>The news of the pull out by KPN comes hot on the heels of the collapse of the telephone system in Dublin for a number of hours last Friday week. It is important that these issues are put in context. Almost 500,000 citizens invested in Eircom and, as shareholders, they expect the board of that company to explain these developments. In addition, thousands of Irish workers depend on this company for employment and their needs must be foremost in our minds when raising this important issue. However, as politicians with responsibility for the overall direction of telecommunications policy, we also must have a response from the Minister to these developments.</P>

      <P>As the House knows, the strategic alliance agreement between the State, Telecom Éireann, KPN of Holland and Telia of Sweden was concluded by the then Minister, Deputy Lowry, in December 1996. Under this agreement, KPN/Telia acquired a 20 per cent stake in the company for an initial down-payment of £183 million, with an option to acquire a further 15 per cent of the company for £200 million by the end of 1999. The full and final price of the 1996 deal is based on a negotiated agreement by which the State gains 60 per cent of the rise in value of KPN-Telia's shareholding after three years above a certain threshold, by way of a so-called clawback arrangement. I repeat that this deal was worked out in December 1996 by the then Minister, Deputy Lowry.</P>

      <P>KPN-Telia exercised the option to increase their stake to 35 per cent immediately following the IPO, and a payment of £200 million was made to the Exchequer. This increased KPN's stake to 21 per cent and Telia's to 14 per cent. Under an IPO agreement between the parties, the additional amount to be paid was to be determined on 31 January 2000, on the basis of the lower of the IPO offer price or the average price of the shares for 90 trading days ending on that date.</P>
      <P>An amendment to the agreement between the Ministers for Public Enterprise and Finance and KPN-Telia was signed on Friday, 26 November, which strengthened the original agreement by guaranteeing that the clawback arising from the 1996 agreement will be based on the IPO offer price. This ensures the payment of an additional £1.16 billion by KPN-Telia and it is payable on 7 February 2000.</P>

      <P>The decision to withdraw the <i>MV Venus</i> roll-on roll-off ship which carried over 3,000 Irish weanlings to France and Italy has cost farmers as much as £50 per head at marts this week. The reason for the withdrawal of the ship merits an urgent explanation as only a few months ago it passed the most stringent requirements for the shipment of live cattle on roll-on roll-off ships. Not alone did the ship meet the requirements, some of the regulations, such as the density of lorries carried, were more severe than those to which other ferries carrying live cattle have to adhere.</P>
      <P>This ship has been particularly successful for its Greek owners on this route in recent months. It appears that the French port authorities issued an ultimatum after inspection, that the ship would have to be withdrawn or it would be impounded. Sources close to the ship say it was a well-appointed ship, eminently suitable for the transport of live cattle, and an inspection, indicated that only very minor adjustments would have to be made.</P>
      <P>There is a deep-rooted belief in cattle export circles that the ship was forced to withdraw for commercial reasons. Other shipping lines increased prices weeks ago but this company did not indicate that it would follow this trend. It is difficult to understand why there should be different laws within the EU governing the suitability of roll-on roll-off ships for the transport of live cattle across the Continent. If there are other verifiable, anti-competitive factors at work the EU should investigate them as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should contact his French counterpart to see what is going on. Farmers have had a bad year in 1999. The only bright spot was the export of good quality live calves and weanlings to the Continent. The Government must make every effort to clear up this matter as there are thousands of such cattle on farms and many farmers are wondering if this will be a second bad winter.</P>

      <P>The export of live cattle from <Col N="1262" /> Ireland is the lifeline of the farming community as demonstrated by the drop of £40 to £50 per head for weanlings in the marts this week. The withdrawal of the <i>MV Venus</i> from the Cork to St. Malo route spells disaster for many farmers who are already on their knees because of an all-time low in farming. This ship carried up to 80 trucks and 300 passengers three times a week from Cork to France. Up to 14 cattle trucks were carried on each sailing, giving a weekly export market valued at about £1.3 million to farmers.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that since the <i>MV Venus</i> came on-stream eight months ago, the number of fully-licensed and approved livestock trucks has risen from 30 to 105. This shows the growth in the live export trade and the positive effect that this vessel has had on the volume of live exports. This ship is fully approved by the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. However, the French authorities have warned that it may be impounded on its next visit to St. Malo, hence the withdrawal of the service in the past few days.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must pull out all the stops to reopen this route. It is important that he clarifies the situation. If this ship is approved by the Irish authorities, why is it not also approved by the French authorities? He also needs to clarify whether there are different regulations governing different ships. Can some carriers have a higher percentage of vehicles with livestock on board than this ship and, if so, why? Even though 14 trucks could be carried, is it the case that they were required to take up the space of over 20 lorries? Are we trying to help live exports or are we happy to see this route closed for other reasons? The Minister of State must clarify his position and outline the steps he is taking to reopen this important route for farmers.</P>

      <P>Ireland will export almost 300,000 live cattle this year. If that is not a commitment from Government, I do not know what is. Cattle prices at factories and in the marts this year are substantially higher than this time last year and we have the highest livestock numbers ever. Notwithstanding this fact, I am making inquiries into the matter. I understand that the vessel is returning to Greece for its annual service and it is unclear what will happen subsequently. I have not been contacted by the owners or by the French authorities concerning this matter.</P>
      <P>The <i>MV Venus </i>was approved by my Department for the carriage of livestock in July 1999. It was one of only five additional vessels approved since the beginning of the year, the remaining four being dedicated to the carriage of livestock. This brought to 17 the number of dedicated ships approved for the carriage of livestock, with a capacity of over 23,000 head of cattle per sailing. All these dedicated ships have been approved for transporting cattle to the Continent, while two have also been approved for markets further afield, such as the Middle East, which has been a big success.</P>
      <P>In addition to these dedicated vessels, a further three roll-on roll-off vessels, including the <i>MV Venus, </i>with a total capacity of 72 livestock units per week, have also been approved. It is clear that everything possible has been done to facilitate the carriage of livestock to our markets in Europe and the Middle East. The most recent figures for cattle exports are a testament to the efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>The figure for total exports of cattle to mid-November 1999 was 370,000, more than two and a half times the 142,500 cattle exported in the same period last year. The previous year was a total disaster. Of these, exports to the Continent amounted to 293,200 compared to 117,800 in the same period last year. There has been a record level of exports and a record level of capacity and every reasonable request as regards inspecting and improving capacity has been facilitated.</P>
      <P>The <i>MV Venus </i>has the capability to carry a large number of animals, but it is one of a number of approved carriers. The exact nature of the current difficulties is not clear and it is certainly not clear whether they relate to the conditions for the transport of animals or to other issues. My understanding is that the owners have been given a list of repairs by the French authorities and, if these are resolved, there would seem to be no reason why the sailings should not resume. I repeat that my Department has discharged its function in regard to inspecting and approving the ship. However, we will continue to monitor the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue again and to bring to the attention of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, the serious housing crisis in County Kildare, with particular reference to meeting the needs of first-time home seekers, and if he will outline his plans to meet these needs in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has not grappled with this problem. I wish to raise his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 319 of 16 November 1999 which dealt with the number of housing starts deemed necessary by his Department to meet the requirements in County Kildare. To put the matter in context, for the past two years, 2,000 families in Kildare have been in need of rehousing and on the council housing list. There are at least another 500 people whose income levels render them ineligible for a sufficient mortgage to buy an ordinary three-bedroomed house. At present, a Dáil Deputy's salary is not sufficient to raise a mortgage to buy such a house. The Minister's reply to that question stated that the Kildare housing authorities were notified on 15 January last of their approved 1999 local authority housing programme, amounting to 165 housing starts. By my calculation, if one increased that to 400 or 500, it would take at least five years to eliminate the total housing need in County Kildare, without another person making an application.</P>
      <P>However, earlier in the year an evaluation was done of the housing needs of the various local authorities throughout the country. In County Kildare, because of the pressure on rented accommodation, a number of people on the housing list have had to move three or four times in the last couple of years. The result was that when the correspondence was sent to the relevant people, it was returned. Those people are now off the housing list and it now indicates about 400 less than the actual figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seriousness of this issue has not percolated through to the Minister's Department. Another reply to a parliamentary question on 16 November, in which the housing needs assessment undertaken by local authorities at the end of last March is referred to, states that 1,126 households are in need of local authority housing in Kildare and that there are another 376 households whose needs are considered to be more suitably met by other housing measures, including voluntary housing or rent supplementation. Whatever the needs are, the only way to meet them is through extra housing accommodation. It does not matter whether it is privately or publicly rented, purchased or voluntary housing &ndash; it makes no difference. The lack of sufficient housing to meet the needs of the growing community in County Kildare and the failure to address this is tantamount to negligence. I am sorry that nothing in the national plan or anywhere else has given me <Col N="1265" /> any indication that there is a serious determination in the Department of the Environment and Local Government to address this issue. If it is not addressed soon &ndash; and this is beginning to manifest itself already &ndash; those on the housing list in counties like Kildare will have to emigrate to get a house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Measures introduced by the Government since last year are helping to assist affordability for lower income and first-time purchasers, particularly through the withdrawal of investor incentives, reduced stamp duty rates, improvements in the local authority shared ownership scheme and the local authority affordable housing scheme. The grant of £3,000 continues to be available for first-time purchasers of new houses. Our objective is to provide more affordable housing with higher density, high quality design and sustainability as part of any integrated housing development. The recently published Planning and Development Bill will underpin the supply of adequate land to provide social and affordable housing and will ensure that provision is made for housing all sectors of the community in an integrated and sustainable way.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of housing in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, for the first time reflects the priority that the Government has given to this issue. The provision of £6 billion, which averages over £850 million per annum over the life of the plan, is more than double the £2.4 billion, at current prices, invested in housing over the period of the previous plan. This will ensure that the social housing needs of over 90,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the plan's period. Furthermore, substantial funding for supporting infrastructural investment is provided for under the plan which should facilitate the provision of some 500,000 private dwellings over the years to 2006.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a key role to play in the provision of housing for those unable to purchase their first home at current market prices. The enhanced national programme of 4,500 new starts in 1999 is the highest level since the mid-1980s. Together with output from other social housing measures and vacancies occurring in existing stock, I expect that the local authority housing programme will cater for almost 10,000 households in 1999. Substantial improvements to the terms and conditions of voluntary housing schemes and the new levels of assistance available should enable this sector to increase output to some 4,000 units of accommodation per annum over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has allocated substantially increased resources for expenditure on housing in the year 2000, with a total housing provision of almost £800 million &ndash; an increase of 50 per cent on the 1999 estimate, which is a record. Local authority and social housing programmes will be allocated £432 million &ndash; an increase of 60 per <Col N="1266" /> cent &ndash; to enable local authorities to meet existing commitments as well as providing for an enhanced programme of 22,000 units under the four year multi-annual programme due to commence in January 2000. This programme will empower local authorities to produce a more streamlined delivery of housing output over the coming years and facilitate a more cost efficient delivery of housing by local authorities. I am very pleased to announce that Kildare has been assigned 810 housing starts over the next four years, a significant increase of 44 per cent on starts over the previous four years.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, almost 1,500 households' needs have been met by Kildare's housing authorities through the various local authority housing programmes. In addition to the direct provision of housing under the local authority social housing programme, the range of other schemes, which include the shared ownership scheme. Improvement works <i>in lieu</i>, vacancies, acquisitions, the provision of voluntary housing and the sale of sites scheme contributes to meeting the housing needs of lower income households.</P>
    <P>There is strong evidence that the Government's strategy to increase the supply of housing is increasingly taking effect. Following five years of record housing output, completion figures for the first nine months of this year which show further increases of 11 per cent on the same period last year continue to exceed expectations. More significantly, output in the mid-east region is up over 8 per cent on last year's total. It is particularly encouraging to note that the number of planning permissions granted for new dwellings in Kildare in the first half of the year have increased by almost 46 per cent on last year, which should translate into even more new houses being built in the coming months.</P>
    <P>At the end of last year, it was estimated that there were about 113 hectares of land in Kildare zoned for residential use and serviced for development. It is important that this land is developed in a sensible and sustainable manner, having regard to the guidelines on residential densities published by my Department in September. Under the serviced land initiative, two schemes have been completed, at Kill and Kilcullen, providing 480 serviced sites, while other schemes under construction or expected to start by the end of the year will provide an additional 2,500 sites. Where schemes are in progress, work on the houses that will be serviced can also start and run in parallel. In addition, under the main water and sewerage programme, there have been significant major works under construction in Kildare which will serve to open up land for development &ndash; the Oberstown scheme at a cost of £15 million and the Leixlip scheme at a cost of £17 million.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that my Department recently sanctioned the appointment of a new post, that of project officer, to Kildare County Council. He will have responsibility for co-ordinating affordable housing initiatives in the county, <Col N="1267" /> under the affordable housing scheme. On the basis of submissions received from developers to provide affordable houses at numerous locations throughout the county, the council has commenced negotiations with landowners and developers with a view to providing approximately 61 housing units in central Kildare. Further negotiations with land owners and developers will take place in relation to further submissions received.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Durkan that he should not look only at the local authority housing construction programme. Local authority members have the power to build additional houses under the various options, including the new ones I have introduced in the past year. More can be done in <Col N="1268" /> Kildare as regards affordable, voluntary and co-operative housing.</P>

      <P>Low cost sites could be made available and the shared ownership scheme could be promoted in the county. I am not impressed by the extent to which Kildare County Council is availing of the various options other than local authority houses. The solution to the problem raised by the Deputy lies much closer to home than he is prepared to admit.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 1 December 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The number of jobs, supported by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, which I have announced since January 1999 is 11,779. Of the 11,779 jobs, 4,318 of these were in respect of the Dublin region while 7,461 jobs relate to the non-Dublin region. A table showing details of the jobs announced in each company, by agency and by location, is being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As regards the number of jobs which have commenced or are still to be provided, I should point out that jobs announced very often do not fall to be filled in that year, or succeeding year, and may be scheduled to come into existence on a planned basis over a period of some years. As such, records are not available either within my Department or its agencies from which to extract these figures.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of the failure to fill jobs, as a result of the lack of suitably qualified people in the relevant area, my Department does not have any record of any representations from any of these employers on this issue.  I am of course aware of emerging concerns in relation to skills shortages in certain sectors of the economy, particularly in the software area. This is not unique to Ireland but is an issue experienced by most developed economies.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the increasing demand for skills, the Government, at the end of 1997, established an expert group on future skills needs. The purpose of the skills group was to identify in a systematic way the skills requirements of different sectors of the economy and to advise on the actions necessary to meet those needs. The group's first report was completed in June 1998 and it is currently working on its second report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of significant initiatives have been taken in the education and training areas to <Col N="1271" /> increase output of people with relevant skills: a £250 million education technology investment fund was announced in November 1997 to fund 1000 additional software and 750 additional technicians places per annum; new two year certificate in international teleservices courses are being held in vocational colleges throughout the country; and the Government approved, in April 1999, the allocation of an additional £75 million to the Department of Education and Science for <Col N="1272" /> the provision of a further 5,400 places for engineering and computer science graduates and technicians.</P>
    <P>These and other measures on the labour and skills front reflect a proactive strategy of getting ahead of the growth in skills demand which should place Ireland in a relatively better position than its competitors who also experience skills shortages but who may not have moved as quickly to address the issue.</P>

      <P>The special working group on a personal injuries tribunal, chaired by Mr. Dan McAuley, published <Col N="1277" /> its first report in May 1997. In that report the special working group set out two alternative structures for a mediation board for occupational injury claims &ndash; the first to operate within the courts system, and secondly, an alternative mediation structure to be established, on a greenfield basis, outside the ambit of the courts system and operating initially on a two year pilot basis.</P>
      <P>A majority of the working group had reservations about the cost effectiveness of a greenfield mediation board and recommended a mediation system to be established within the courts system, having regard to assurances given to it about the rapid pace and scale of the on-going reform of court procedures and elimination of delays.</P>
      <P>In pursuing the special working group's recommendation, our Department has been advised that the question of establishing a claims mediation process within the courts would be a matter to be pursued with the new courts services board. This will be done expeditiously once the working group's final report arrives to us for consideration.</P>
      <P>The special working group has completed its research into personal injury compensation systems in operation in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Canada, New Zealand and the USA in the areas of occupational injuries and motor accident injuries.</P>
      <P>The special working group's consideration of the results of this research and its relevance to the possible improvement of the systems for delivering personal injury compensation in Ireland will, of necessity, involve a re-appraisal of the recommendations in its first report on the establishment of a claims mediation system.</P>
      <P>The group is currently progressing its report, which will contain recommendations for our further consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft directive which the Deputies refer to is the Commission proposal for a Council direc<Col N="1278" /> tive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community. This proposal was published in November 1998. As yet it has not been placed on the agenda for the Social Affairs Council. The Presidency of the day sets the agenda for any discussions by the Council. The programme for the forthcoming Portuguese Presidency has not yet been published.</P>
    <P>The provision of information and consultation is normal in this country. Ireland has a wide range of statutory provisions for information and consultation already in place, which addresses areas of vital interest to employees. These provisions include the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, as amended by the Protection of  Employment Order, 1996, covering collective redundancies; European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980; certain provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989; transitional Information and Consultation of Employees Act, 1996, which applies to large scale multinationals; and particular terms of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 includes commitments by the social partners and the Government to the development of partnership at enterprise level. These include the advancement of information and consultation in the workplace. Many Irish based enterprises are developing employee information and consultation as part of a competitive strategy, which recognises the role and value of employees in business development. A successor to our national agreement would be aimed at deepening partnership at enterprise level.</P>
    <P>The social partners will be consulted and an examination of the Commission proposal is being undertaken in preparation for the beginning of the consultation process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new opportunities for women programme, <Col N="1279" /> NOW, is a strand of the Employment Community Initiative which is funded by the European Social Fund. The total investment in 71 NOW projects since 1995 will amount to 20.3 million ecu, £15 million approximately, in European social funds and 2.1 million ecu, £1.6 million approximately, in European regional development funds. Under the terms of the EU initiative, funds will cease to be committed at the end of 1999 and final payment will take place during 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently allocated a tranche of funds received from the European Commission to the employment projects. This should relieve any urgent liquidity problems experienced by some promoters, particularly voluntary and community groups. My Department has made a further claim to the European Commission for the outstanding amounts and we expect to receive such funding early in the new year. We will continue to vigorously pursue the European Commission in relation to all outstanding moneys. Consultations are also taking place between my Department and officials in the Department of Finance on the possibility of alternative financing arrangements to bridge any shortfalls in Commission funding in the future.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of the employment initiative is to target groups that face specific difficulties in the employment market and, accordingly, to explore innovative ways of combating exclusion in the labour market with a view to identifying and extracting lessons from specific projects and incorporating them into national policies. Through participation in the mainstreaming forum, established by my Department in 1997, relevant organisations and policymakers have the facility to influence future policy actions arising from the outcomes of the initiative. The work of the mainstreaming forum is ongoing and will continue into 2000.</P>
    <P>The national development plan has allocated over £9.9 billion in expenditure on the employment and human resources development operational programme. I expect that groups and organisations previously funded under the NOW programme would seek funding under a number of measures in the plan.</P>
    <P>The new proposed human resources EU initiative, EQUAL, which will run from 2000 to 2006, will continue to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in the labour market by way of specific projects involving local consortia and transitional partners. The total amount of European social funds available will be 32 million euro or over £25 million.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for the new EQUAL EU initiative will shortly be drafted by my Department. The draft programme will, subsequently, be submitted to the European Commission and a consultation process with the appropriate groups and organisations will follow. It is expected that a public call for project proposals will take place in autumn 2000.</P>

      <P>In the period 1 January &ndash; 26 November 1999 a total of 707 inspections for conformity with the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, were carried out by the labour inspectorate. In these inspections approximately 280 breaches of the Act were detected. Most of these breaches were of a minor nature resulting in the issue of appropriate written warnings to the employers concerned. In 11 cases, however, the breaches were more substantive and these, together with four other breaches brought to attention through complaints received from the public, are under active consideration with a view to possible institution of prosecution proceedings.</P>
      <P>Out-of-normal-office-hours inspection work in respect of the Act began in the week commencing 15 November 1999. In the five-week period up to Saturday 18, December 1999, all labour inspectors are participating in the first night-time campaign targeted exclusively on enforcement of the Protection of Young Persons Act, 1996, in the pub, hotel and catering sectors. This campaign is being carried out with a special focus on establishments in the Dublin and Cork urban areas.</P>

      <P>FÁS is the body statutorily responsible for the organisation and regulation of apprenticeship in the designated trades. FÁS is also involved, in partnership with the education sector, in the delivery of the off-the-job training phases of the apprenticeship system. I am satisfied with the role played by FÁS in these regards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The buoyant state of the Irish economy has resulted in record intakes of apprentices in recent years. As might be expected given the level of infrastructural investment associated with economic growth, there has been particularly strong demand for apprentices in construction related trades. This, combined with the unavoidable lead-time in scaling up training delivery to meet the new demand, has led to delays in calling appren<Col N="1281" /> tices to their off-the-job courses in some trades including construction.</P>
    <P>In response, significant extra apprenticeship training capacity has already been provided through FÁS and the education system. The institutions responsible are currently assessing whether additional measures can be pursued to address the training supply issues arising from the current levels of demand for apprenticeship training.</P>
    <P>The situation is being closely monitored by the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee which was established by the board of FÁS to advise on all issues in relation to apprenticeship and is representative of the social partners and the training providers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the survey referred to by the Deputy. This survey was undertaken to assess not only workers' experience of but their attitude to national social partnership agreements. It is encouraging that the study of these trade union members indicates that the majority of those surveyed view the framing of a new national agreement positively. I expect that an agreement to succeed Partnership 2000 would aim to deepen partnership in Irish enterprises.</P>
      <P>There are indications from a number of sources that partnership agreements are increasingly found in Irish workplaces. At a recent conference organised by SIPTU it was stated that increasing numbers of that union's membership are covered by an agreement on employee participation. Earlier this year, an IBEC survey of companies which together employed more than 200,000 employees, indicated that 44 per cent of the companies surveyed had jointly created partnership initiatives with their unions. These cover such areas as: communications; consultation and joint management &ndash; employee activities; organisation of work; training and development; financial involvement; job control; occupational health and safety; and equal opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contemporary enterprise faces a number of challenges in order to maintain competitiveness in the rapidly changing global economy. The emergence of partnership initiatives has facilitated the understanding by both employers and employees of these challenges and enables them <Col N="1282" /> to work together in a non-adversarial manner to meet them. There is evidence of considerable efforts by unions and employers and their organisations to meet the challenge.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that the development of partnership at enterprise level is an evolving process. Chapter 9 of Partnership 2000 states: &ldquo;The National Framework for Partnership for Competitive Enterprises does not attempt to impose any single structure or model of partnership. There is a need to tailor the approach to fit different employment settings.&rdquo;  Partnership at enterprise level can and should take many forms. It is to be anticipated that the emergence of partnership will occur gradually.</P>
    <P>The national centre for partnership established under the current national agreement, Partnership 2000, is working to facilitate the establishment of partnership agreements in enterprises, both in the private and public sectors. This work underlines the commitment of the Government and the social partners to the extension of partnership in the workplace. An evaluation of progress made to date is being carried out for the centre and the results will be available to it in December.</P>

    <P>A national monitoring committee representative of relevant Departments and the social partners has now been established on foot of the Government decision in July 1999 to introduce a dedicated social economy programme. The responsibility for chairing the committee lies with my Department and Mr. Eugene Forde, principal officer, is the current chairman. The first monitoring committee meeting took place on 3 November 1999. Progress was made on adopting the terms of reference and rules and procedures of the committee. A further meeting of the committee is expected to take place in mid-December 1999 with the aim of adopting the operating framework of the programme. I have asked the chairman of the committee to forward a list of <Col N="1283" /> members directly to Deputy Allen and Deputy Owen.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation. The number of people killed in work-related accidents in the agriculture sector in 1998 was 26, of whom seven were children. The authority, in both its 1999 and 2000 work programmes, will continue to carry out targeted inspection, promotional and advisory activities aimed at reducing accident and fatality rates in the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority, in 1999, has set a target of 1000 inspections in the farming and forestry sector. which is an increase of 200 over the 1998 figure. In addition to inspection activities, the authority also engages in promotional activities and has an extensive range of information material available to anyone seeking advice and guidance. The authority works closely with all of the major farming bodies in promoting farm safety.</P>
      <P>The authority has, in particular, emphasised to farmers the need to carry out appropriate risk assessments and to draw up safety statements to cover all hazards on the farm. In September of this year the Authority launched a farm safety handbook at the National Ploughing Championships. It is a handbook of practical advice and guidance for farmers to enable them to achieve high standards of health and safety during farming operations. In addition, the authority is participating in a European campaign on farm safety focusing, in particular, on safety statements and child safety education and training.</P>
      <P>The authority's farm safety task force also continues to offer guidance to the authority and to spearhead promotional activities. The members of this task force are drawn from the farming community itself and they work closely with farming organisations such as the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICA and Teagasc. Farm safety is a priority area of activity and attention for both myself and the Health and Safety Authority. The authority will continue to consult, at top level, with the main farming interests so that adequate direction is given to the efforts to reduce accidents on farms.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Act, 1998, which was sponsored by the Minister for Public Enterprise, was signed into law by the President on 2 December 1998. Detailed regulations, which are necessary to give operational effect to the provisions of the Act, are currently being prepared by the Health and Safety Authority in co-operation with this Department and in consultation with all relevant and interested parties. The regulations will give effect to four EU Directives &ndash; 94/55/EC 95/50/EC, 96/86/EC and 99/47/EC &ndash; applying the international ADR arrangements to national transport.</P>
      <P>The regulations are complex and involve roles and responsibilities for a number of Departments and other public bodies to ensure their adequate implementation and enforcement. The preparatory work is well advanced and I hope the have the regulations finalised within the next few months. As soon as the regulations are finalised, the necessary order to bring the Act into operation will be made. On the question of resources, I would like to assure the Deputy that I am continuing to work to ensure that the Health and Safety Authority has sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its extended statutory functions.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to report that at its meeting on Friday, 26 November last, the board of the Irish Stock Exchange decided to introduce immediately a new rule for listed companies which will require the disclosure of individual directors' remuneration with effect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2000. This means that this information will require to be disclosed in the annual reports of listed companies publishable in 2001 and beyond. However, I hope that many listed companies will now decide to include the new information in their 1999 annual reports which will be published next year.</P>
      <P>I welcome the exchange's decision as a contribution to greater openness and transparency in Irish corporate life.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The Government approved a restructuring of the community employment programme on 21 July 1999, after which my Department issued the following implementation guidelines to FÁS for the uniform operation of the programme nationwide: the eligibility age for participation in CE will be raised from 21 years to 25 years with effect from 29 October 1999. The following exemptions will apply for persons under 25 years of age: travellers; ex-offenders; refugees; people with disabilities; people referred under drugs task force; offshore island inhabitants; and 18-24 year olds, referred through EAP, who are 18 months or more unemployed.</P>
      <P>Duration of participant breaks between schemes will be increased from six to 12 months with effect from April 2000. Offshore island residents will be exempt from this change. Future participation in CE by an individual will be capped at three years with effect from 29 October 1999. An individual's previous participation on the programme will not be taken into account. Offshore island residents will be exempt from this change. The number of places on CE will be reduced over a five year period to 28,000. There will be synchronisation to the greatest degree possible between the introduction of the new social economy programme and reductions of CE places. Eligibility to participate in CE has been extended to qualified adults and widows/widowers with effect from 15 September 1999.</P>
      <P>With reference to the first, second and third points above, FÁS has indicated to my Department that it may need to be more flexible in certain cases with the implementation date as commitments had already been entered into prior to the date of application of the Government decision.</P>

      <P>As we approach the end the year I would like to point out that the 31 December 1999 will be a special public holiday in Ireland, in recognition of the uniqueness of the millennium celebrations in all of our lifetimes. There are, however, sectors <Col N="1288" /> where it may be necessary for employees to attend work on 31 December.</P>
      <P>Workers have minimum statutory rights and entitlements under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, in relation to work on public holidays and these must be fully respected. It is of particular importance, in relation to the occasion in question, that attention should be paid to such matters as maximum hours of work, hours of rest and night work. Furthermore, the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, prohibits the employment of 16-17 year olds beyond 10 p.m. as a matter of health and safety.</P>
      <P>In the normal course of industrial relations, arrangements for work on occasions such as the New Years Eve holiday are, of course, matters that are to be addressed through negotiation between employers and employees involved, or their representatives and, therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to provide detailed guidelines for agreements on pay and conditions for millennium work. I encourage the parties concerned to work together in ensuring 31 December will be a good occasion for everybody.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Irish Insurance Federation that the &ldquo;exclusion clauses&rdquo; to which the Deputy refers apply only in respect of professional fees in cases where there is a dispute between the insured and the insurer. In property damage cases, the insurance company provides and pays for professional experts &ndash; engineers, architects and-or property surveyors &ndash; to assess the structural damage. On the basis of this assessment, the settlement of the claim is normally, especially in the case of private residential property, agreed between the insured and the insurer. Accordingly, the insured incurs no costs in the preparation of the claim. However, where there is a dispute as to the assessment, the insured has the right to seek further professional advice. However, this must be done at his or her own expense.</P>

This is a right which many Irish firms are exploiting very successfully both in terms of establishing businesses in other member states and in supplying the Single Market.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has confirmed that it has not received any complaints alleging below cost selling by the company referred to. If any such complaints are made they will, of course, be fully investigated.</P>
      <P>I recently met with the company's representatives following their request to brief me on their proposals for the Irish market. During the meeting, I was informed that the company was fully aware of the provisions of the Groceries Order, 1987, and that the approach is to fully respect the legislative environment in any new market. I briefed the representatives on the supplier development programme operated by Enterprise Ireland and suggested that the company meet with Enterprise Ireland to identify potential Irish suppliers. The company agreed to pursue the matter.</P>

      <P>The competition and mergers review group, established by my predecessor, has published a number of discussion documents including one on the newspaper sector in March 1999. Comments were invited on the document by 30 April 1999.</P>
      <P>I had asked the group, established by my predecessor, to take account of and advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry dealing with competition issues. These CNI recommendations concern the factors to be considered in regulating changes of ownership of newspapers, an amendment to merger law to enable consideration to be given to the acquisition of control over newspapers by means other than the acquisition of shares and the consideration of the issue of concentration of ownership on a media wide as well as on a single media basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the review group received submissions from interested parties, mainly newspaper concerns. However, as this issue forms but one part of the overall and broad ranging work of the review group, I expect that this will form part of the review group's comprehensive report <Col N="1291" /> and recommendations to me, which I expect within the next few months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 101 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>Following a lengthy and wide ranging consultation process, the Government decided on 29 March 1999 to implement new operational arrangements for the management, development and delivery of the national employment service function. These included: the assimilation of the local employment service under FÁS, as a discrete component of a more integrated, dual-stranded national employment service, the other component being the existing FÁS employment service; the establishment of an employment service advisory committee within FÁS which will have responsibility for advising the FÁS executive on the operation and development of all components of the national employment service function, including the LES; and membership of the advisory committee to comprise the following representatives drawn from the main FÁS board: one &ndash; Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, one &ndash; Department of Finance, one &ndash; Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, one &ndash; Department of Education and Science, one from IBEC, one from ICTU, and one worker director together with a representative each from INOU, PLANET, the representative body of the Partnerships, ADM and the LES co-ordinators.</P>
      <P>Deliberations on how best to implement the Government decision and to put in place practical operational arrangements to assimilate the LES into FÁS are continuing in the Department. That said, I have decided that, in future, FÁS locally will contract directly with each LES to provide a specific service for identified categories of jobseeker. In this connection, each LES is being asked to establish itself as a separate legal entity with which FÁS can contract. As the Deputies are no doubt aware, the existing contractual arrangements in relation to the LES are between my Department and the partnerships.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the above arrangements will fully achieve the intention to create a more integrated and focused dual stranded national employment service, which will operate in a co-ordinated and complimentary manner, and best use the resources at its disposal to target and engage with those most in need of assistance. The LES will continue to be informed by local needs as set out in the partnership plans and appropriate liaison arrangements will need to be put in place to ensure effective consultation with the partnerships in the development of employment service plans at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inaugural meeting of the advisory committee will take place before year's end. FÁS will invite nominations by the end of the week from the designated bodies to the advisory committee. <Col N="1293" /> There will be an opportunity for all interested parties, including the partnerships, to contribute to the debate in relation to the national employment service through their representation on the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements fully provide for the work of the LES to continue, for its particular focus and work methods to be developed and for its identity and ethos to be protected, albeit within a revised operational framework. There is no reason for any LES client to feel concern. There will be operational problems to be faced over the coming months, but I have no doubt these can be overcome and that after this transitional phase, we will have a more effective and co-ordinated employment service, which will be in a position to respond fully to the rapidly changing needs of the Irish labour market.</P>

      <P>I have recently completed negotiations with the European Commission on the maximum levels of grant aid which will be permitted at a regional level, with effect from 2000. A key concern of the Commission in producing the new guidelines was to reduce the amount of overall State aid given out by Government in the EU, leading to harmful bidding contests for mobile investments, and to encourage a genuine concentration of permitted aid in disadvantaged regions, objectively measured.</P>
      <P>The new aid ceiling for the Objective One area after January 1 will be 40 per cent of investment costs, plus a top-up of up to 15 per cent for SMEs. While this is a reduction from the 71 per cent limit now generally in place, it is significantly higher than the 20 per cent maximum, plus a 10 per cent top-up for SMEs which will apply in most of the rest of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and the development agencies will continue to encourage more industry to locate to areas outside the greater Dublin region which is suffering from development pressures at present. Measures have been outlined in the recently published national development plan to improve prosperity and regional attractiveness for investment across the country. The Government is very aware that prosperity from recent economic growth has been experienced somewhat unevenly in different regions. The significant infrastructure, human resource, enterprise and social investments planned for the next seven years are designed to rebalance regional growth and <Col N="1294" /> employment rates. I am confident that they will have a very positive impact.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 106 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has spent more than £800,000 on a series of interlinked initiatives. A very extensive public media campaign was organised. Television, radio, newspaper and billboard advertising were used. I have recently issued over 300,000 letters to businesses throughout the country, with the co-operation of the banks, insurance industry and accountancy bodies, warning businesses again of the serious consequences of inaction on their part in the face of this problem.</P>
      <P>It is not considered that an intensified campaign would be effective at this stage. However, I intend to ensure that the Enterprise Ireland help-line service will continue for the rest of this year and, indeed, into early next year also. With regard to giving advice to business in the event of disruption or problems caused by Y2K, the position is that the Enterprise Ireland helpline will be in operation over the new year period to deal with queries from businesses who are experiencing problems at the start of the new millennium and to offer them advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole basis of the Y2K business awareness campaign has been to make businesses aware of the problem and encourage them to take action to get their businesses compliant. As has been stated on many occasions, ultimate responsibility for this issue lies with the individual businesses and it is they who must ensure that their oper<Col N="1295" /> ations can continue without interruption after the new year. The Government has made every effort and expended considerable sums of money to encourage compliance, but it is only the individual business managers who can take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the National Year 2000 Emergency Committee is to oversee and co-ordinate contingency planning and emergency management arrangements for potential problems arising from year 2000 related incidents and the celebration of the new millennium in the vital services. That committee set up sub-groups to examine the state of business compliance in the financial sector and emergency services sector to assess continuity in the provision of business services. These groups gave satisfactory reports on their findings.</P>

      <P>The job initiative programme, which was launched as a pilot initiative by the Government in 1996, is an active labour market intervention measure specifically targeted at people who are 35 years of age or over and unemployed or in receipt of lone parents allowance for a minimum of five years.</P>
      <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants were commissioned by my Department in April 1999 to undertake a review of the effectiveness of job initiative against its objectives on reaching the end of the first phase of its operation. As the Deputy is aware, I have, in accordance with one of the recommendations made by the consultants, decided to provide a six months extension to participants in phase one of the programme who were due to complete their three year term on the programme on 31 December 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this additional period on the programme participants will be assessed and their training and educational requirements addressed according to the particular need of the individual. Participants will also be provided with the assistance of FÁS placement services and the local employment services and the encouragement of managing agents to seek alternative employment in the open labour market. It is anticipated that the training/jobseeking needs of participants on phases two and three will be addressed in a similar manner and that this can be accommodated in <Col N="1296" /> the three year programme. A considerable amount has been learned from the evaluation of the pilot phase of this programme and future participants will benefit from both enhanced training and active engagement by the employment services, thereby facilitating their return to the open labour market.</P>

      <P>In anticipation of the passing of the necessary legislation, my officials are attending to the logistical requirements for the establishment of the office, including the recruitment of the necessary staff.

      <P>I am confident that the demanding timetable which we have set ourselves in relation to this task can be achieved.

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is, at my request, currently undertaking a review of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and associated legislation, and I expect to receive proposals from the authority before the end of the year on any improvements in the legislation that may be considered necessary, including the provisions relating to safety consultation, safety representation, enforcement and penalty provisions.</P>
      <P>The proper management of workplace health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and partnership. The resourcing of the Health and Safety Authority is not the only determining factor in ensuring proper compliance with occupational health and safety legislation. Inspection is but one element in the drive to improve safety standards in all sectors of employment. While the primary statutory duty of care to ensure a safe place of work rests with the employer, joint responsibility, commitment and participation from all sides is necessary to foster safe work practices at ground level. I am, however, continuing to work on behalf of the authority in order to make available the necessary resources to enable it to properly carry out its statutory functions.</P>
      <P>Many times, and particularly during 1998, I have urged the parties involved to strengthen their commitment to partnership. Recent discussions between the authority, ICTU, and CIF have culminated in the construction safety partnership agreement which I launched in October 1999. This agreement represents the true spirit of partnership in that it has been negotiated, and will be implemented by, those most directly concerned. The construction safety partnership is to produce a construction industry safety plan within three months, which will incorporate the recommendations of both the Forum for the Construction Industry and the authority's construction advisory committee and will include proposals related to consultation and safety representation. I look forward to receiving this plan in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the construction safety partnership, a construction site safety representatives <Col N="1299" /> pilot programme was also announced. This pilot programme will benefit directly the participating projects and will also generate an awareness of health and safety among all employers and employees. There is an increased willingness on all sides to make safety work.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that genuine efforts are being made on all fronts by the parties to promote improved health and safety standards in the construction sector and I will continue to offer my support and advice in any way I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that EU legislation, the effect of which is to open EU markets, including the Irish market, to competition from insurance providers based throughout the EU, is in force in Ireland since 1994. In addition, the Deputy will be aware that I have recently removed the cap on brokers' commission in an effort to encourage further competition in the Irish market. Nevertheless, the level of insurance premiums, especially in the areas of public liability and motor, are still high enough to give concern.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there has been extensive examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of premiums focusing on a number of the key cost elements including the levels of personal injury compensation and the costs associated with settling compensation claims. Concurrent with this examination efforts are being made to identify measures which both individually and cumulatively could have a moderating effect on insurance costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the main contributory factors to rising premium costs were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements; the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general damages awards relative to special damages in smaller claims. Following consideration by Government of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, a special working group was established to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions. The special working group completed the first part of its remit in 1998 and recommended a structure for a voluntary mediation system for occupational injuries which could be operated within the reformed courts system. It will present its second report <Col N="1300" /> shortly. In the light of their reports and after consultations with the new Courts Service, follow up to the group's report will be considered.</P>
    <P>In addition, I re-established the motor insurance advisory board last year to provide information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs.</P>
    <P>Apart from Government initiatives, greater attention to safety in the workplace and on the roads can further reduce insurance costs. Accordingly, last year I launched the voluntary code of practice adopted by the initiative on workplace safety group established in May 1996, a group representing the key players in the area of accident prevention and claims mitigation chaired by IBEC, with representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, ICTU, the Health and Safety Authority and IBEC. Also a number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the Driving Instructors Register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the gardaí, continue to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>

      <P>It is generally accepted that staff turnover is higher in call centres than in other sectors of the economy. It is difficult to give a meaningful average for the industry as the rate of staff turnover varies widely among different companies. The turnover rate in some cases exceeds 20-25 per cent which is in line with international trends.</P>
      <P>The rate of turnover is influenced by a wide range of factors including the nature of the company's work, the quality of management, location of the office, terms and conditions of employment, availability of alternative employment in the area as well as other factors.</P>
      <P>Factors which might contribute to high turnover rates include that many young graduates with international language skills take up positions in call centres as interim jobs while they search for more senior positions; call centre jobs appeal to young people who nowadays are more mobile; recruitment in the IT sector is highly competitive and, consequently, there is considerable staff movement between call centres; and entry jobs in call centres are generally at the lower end of the pay scale.</P>

      <P>The latest quarterly national household survey, which was published by the Central Statistics Office on 13 October last, indicates that employment in the south-east region increased by 18,300 between the labour force survey in April 1997 and the latest QNHS survey period, March-May 1999. This represents an increase of 13.1 per cent and compares favourably to other regions outside the Dublin and mid-east regions.</P>
      <P>I have recently completed negotiations with the European Commission on the maximum levels of grant aid which will be permitted at a regional level, with effect from the year 2000. The economic structure of the south-east and its problems were specifically recognised during these negotiations. As a result, the level of aid for the south-east has been set at the maximum allowed for a Community &ldquo;C&rdquo; region, that is, 20 per cent of investment costs &ndash; plus a top-up of up to 10 per cent for SMEs &ndash; and is higher than regions such as Dublin and the mid-east which have benefited comparatively better from recent economic growth.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> The Government recently launched the national development plan which provides for the investment of £40 billion from 2000 until 2006. A key objective of this investment is to improve prosperity and regional attractiveness across the country. The Government is very aware that prosperity from recent economic growth has been experienced somewhat unevenly in different regions. The significant infrastructure, human resource, enterprise and social investments planned for the next seven years are designed to rebalance regional growth and employment rates. I am confident that this investment programme will contribute substantially to the social and economic wellbeing of the south-east region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I published the final report of the Interdepartmental Group on Implementation of a National Minimum Wage on 22 June. The group set out detailed recommendations for the implementation of the national minimum wage. It recommended that the date for implementation should be 1 April 2000 for all sectors of the economy. Other recommendations concern the definition of working time, pay reference period, reckonable pay, under 18 rate, job entrants and certified training rate, repercussive claims, firms in financial difficulty, uprating mechanism, the interaction with joint labour committees and enforcement.</P>
      <P>The group's final report includes the impact study undertaken for the group by the ESRI. The ESRI study concludes that approximately 163,000 employees will be likely to benefit from the introduction of the national minimum wage set at £4.40 per hour, of whom approximately 80,000 will receive an increase of at least £1 per hour. Over half of these beneficiaries will be women and more than 40 per cent will be persons aged under 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESRI study estimates that the impact of the introduction of the national minimum wage on the national wage bill will be an increase of 1.6 per cent of total gross earnings, excluding any repercussive effect. This is much lower than the figure of 4 per cent estimated by the National Minimum Wage Commission in its report last <Col N="1303" /> year, mainly due to wage growth between 1997 and the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The ESRI impact study highlights the possible increased detrimental effect on the level of employment if the initial rate of the national minimum wage were to be set at above £4.40 per hour. I intend to introduce the national minimum wage from 1 April 2000 at £4.40 per hour and I have no plans to review this proposed initial rate.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the National Minimum Wage Bill is at an advanced stage. Subject to Government approval, I will publish the Bill in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Lone parents, as a group, are not being excluded from the community employment programme. Following the recent restructuring of CE, the age limit for general eligibility was increased from 21 to 25. This change was necessary to better target available places at the most disadvantaged of the long-term unemployed. Lone parents under the age of 25 can still qualify for participation in CE if they are members of any of the following groups which are exempt from the recent changes to the programme travellers, ex-offenders, refugees, people with disabilities, people referred under the drugs task force, offshore island inhabitants and 18-24 year olds, referred through EAP, who are 18 months or more unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche review of the CE pro<Col N="1304" /> gramme, undertaken in 1998, argued strongly that due to the part-time nature of the community employment programme it is not the most appropriate introduction to the workforce for young people. It also indicated clearly that training schemes have higher employment rates and are a better option for young people who have not been unemployed for very long. In recognition of this situation and in order to facilitate the extra demand for training places among younger unemployed people, the Government allocated up to £23 million for new training initiatives targeted at younger unemployed people in 1999, £2 million of which was specifically targeted at the needs of lone parents.</P>

      <P>It is vitally important to establish a sound legal base for the proposed insurance disclosure regulations. The original intention was to make the regulations under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980. Legal advice suggested that a comprehensive disclosure regime, as proposed by my Department, could be vulnerable to constitutional challenge if introduced under the 1980 Act. I was therefore obliged to have recourse to enabling provisions in the Insurance Bill, 1999, setting out the principles and policies upon which the disclosure regulations would be based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations to introduce greater transparency in the sale of insurance products will be introduced by me as soon as practicable following enactment of the Insurance Bill, 1999, which is due to be published shortly. The Bill contains, <i>inter alia</i>, enabling measures which will allow me to introduce policyholder information requirements at point of sale and on an ongoing basis in respect of both life and non-life insurance. There are three elements to our proposals: (a) the incorporation of existing policyholder information requirements into primary legislation, in respect of life assurance policies and proposals, for legal clarity; (b) the provision of additional policyholder information requirements, including disclosure of commission payments, over and <Col N="1306" /> above the minimum EU requirements for life assurance; and (c) the provision of additional policyholder information requirements over and above the minimum EU requirements for non-life insurance.</P>
    <P>Draft regulations to give effect to life insurance disclosure are being drafted within our Department and have been widely disseminated for comment by interested parties. The precise format cannot be finalised until the final enactment of the Insurance Bill.</P>
    <P>Framework proposals in pursuance of greater transparency in non-life insurance, based on the enabling provisions of the Bill, are being prepared by our Department.

      <P>The creation of jobs is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one in which I, as Minister, would have any function.</P>
      <P>The total number of jobs created by the agencies under my Department's remit, that is IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, amounted to 29,353 in 1997. In addition, the county enterprise boards created a total of 2,988 jobs. The corresponding figures for 1998 are 30,622 and 3,157, respectively.</P>
      <P>Job creation figures for 1999 are not yet available. Forfás, the agency with responsibility for advising on industrial policy, is conducting its annual employment survey at present, the provisional results of which will be available by year end. Information on future projects &ldquo;in the pipeline&rdquo; is particularly a day to day matter for the agencies concerned, is, of its nature, confidential and is also not a matter in which I, as Minister, would have any direct function.</P>
      <P>I can confirm, however, that there is now a greater emphasis by the industrial development agencies on the regional dispersal of investment projects. IDA Ireland, in particular, as part of its new focus on the regions, is seeking to deliver over 50 per cent of all newly approved greenfield jobs to the Objective One region. This compares to approximately 25 per cent of projects which were being brought to this region in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, sets out the statutory rights for employees in respect of holiday entitlements. The Act provides for the following nine public holidays per year: 1 January, New Year's Day; St. Patrick's Day; Easter Monday; the first Monday in May; the first Monday in June; the first Monday in August; the first Monday in October; Christmas Day; and St. Stephen's Day.</P>
      <P>The average public holiday entitlement in the EU at present is approximately 11 days annually.</P>
      <P>The Government has already approved the designation of 31 December 1999 as a special once-off public holiday to commemorate the millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> The Government recognises and values deeply the great contribution rendered by women to the betterment of society both in Ireland and throughout the world. Accordingly, it welcomes the designation by the UN of International Women's Day on 8 March 2000 as a day on which to call world attention to, and to celebrate, that great contribution. However, there are no plans to mark International Women's Day, or indeed, any other days in the foreseeable future as public holidays.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal piece of workplace health and safety legislation. It sets out the duties of <Col N="1311" /> both employers and employees in relation to the provision and maintenance of a safe working environment. This Act applies to all places of work and to all employers, employees and the self-employed. Sections 6 and 7 of this Act state that it is the primary duty of every employer to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all employees and that persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their safety and health.</P>
    <P>The authority is actively alerting employers of possible year 2000 problems. Over the past 12 months, the authority has undertaken an information campaign to alert employers to their duty in the specific context of possible year 2000 problems impacting on key workplace systems. The authority has participated in an awareness campaign with the Small Firms Association. This involved participating in a nationwide lecture tour with other Y2K involved parties in which the authority encouraged employers to have contingency plans in place in the event of failure.</P>
    <P>During visits to workplaces, inspectors are bringing the Y2K issue to the attention of employers and such plans should form part of the risk assessment review which is regularly carried out by employers.</P>
    <P>The authority has published guidelines on this issue for use by interested parties. The guidelines are available free of charge from the Health and Safety Authority and are given out during inspection visits as appropriate. The authority also carried out a survey on chemical process industries and found that in general identification and awareness levels are high. The information relating to year 2000 is available on the health and safety authority website.</P>
    <P>This Department has carried out various initiatives to increase awareness among businesses and to encourage them to take action to ensure that their computer systems are Y2K compliant. However, ultimate responsibility for this issue lies with the individual businesses and it is they who must ensure that their operations can continue safely and without interruption after the new year.</P>

      <P>The community employment programme is targeted at the long-term unemployed. Limited resources do not make it possible to provide community employment for all unemployed persons. Therefore, it is <Col N="1312" /> essential to target the programme at those most in need.</P>
      <P>Currently, persons in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, one parent family payment, widow's and widower's pension and persons classified as qualified adults of long-term unemployed persons are eligible to participate in community employment in their own right. In order to satisfy the eligibility criteria, persons with children who are in receipt of deserted wives benefit can apply to transfer to OPFP in order to become eligible to participate in community employment. The current eligibility criteria for community employment were introduced in July 1999 following a detailed review of the programme and in response to the recommendations of the Deloitte &amp; Touch report on community employment. I have no plans at present to further widen the eligibility criteria. However, I will of course keep all programmes under scrutiny to ensure that they meet their objectives and my Department will address any anomalies or discrepancies that arise.</P>
      <P>All unemployed people, including married women who wish to return to the workforce and deserted wives, are eligible to participate in FÁS mainstream training/specific skills training programmes.</P>

      <P>The competition and mergers review group set up by my predecessor has as its terms of reference to review and make recommendations on the mergers legislation in the context of a legislative consolidation; the effectiveness of competition legislation and associated regulations; cultural matters in the context of the 1991 Act and in particular, section 4 (2) of that Act; and appropriate structures for implementing the above legislation.</P>
      <P>The group may also commission detailed sectoral studies as required and will, in its work, review the evolution of competition policy at EU and global level.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, I asked the group to take account of and advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry dealing with competition issues.</P>
      <P>The group is at present concluding its fourth and final discussion document in relation to the groceries order which, I understand, will be published within the next few weeks. The chairman has also indicated to me that the group is concurrently at an advanced stage of considering its final document, which will be presented to me in the new year. Following on receipt of the group's final report and recommendations, I will be examining the issues therein and taking appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All complaints and allegations in regard to price fixing and cartel activity are matters for the competition authority to which pro-active enforcement powers were given under the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996. It is disturbing to learn from the Director of Competition Enforcement of the high number of complaints in this regard. This is all the more reason to make sure that the legislation and resourcing are absol-<Col N="1314" /> utely optimal to tackle such allegations. The final recommendations and report to me of the review group will assist in informing planing in this regard.</P>

      <P>The spring 1999 quarterly national household survey published by the Central Statistics Office, in October 1999 contains details of the numbers of persons at work using the International Labour Office measure. There were 1,591,100 persons in employment in the second quarter of 1999.

In summary, the recommendations concern the provision of additional training places to meet skills needs in the high tech sector, the potential for more flexible delivery of courses, the strengthening of business education links, the need for research into issues such as completion rates and research student numbers and the promotion abroad of job opportunities in Ireland. The recommendations impact on both education and training policy makers and providers.</P>

      <P>I am making a sum of £9 million available up to the end of 2001 for a pilot training networks programme. In addition, a sum of £1.7 million has been committed to the programme for 1999 from the European Social Fund.</P>
      <P>The training networks programme is a response to calls from employer representatives and to a commitment in Partnership 2000 to develop new approaches to enterprise training, with business taking the lead. The programme is founded on a recognition that the private sector is primarily responsible for identifying its own training needs. It focuses on mobilising groups of companies to come together in networks to identify their common training requirements and to develop strategies to address those requirements.</P>
      <P>The training networks programme is administered by an enterprise led company called Skillnets Limited, which is managed by a board primarily representative of employers, business interests and trade unions. An official of my Department is also a member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme was launched on 9 June this year and was followed by a public call for proposals which was managed and delivered by Skillnets. Applications were invited under three categories: strand A &ndash; for existing networks <Col N="1316" /> which had already identified their training needs; strand B &ndash; for groups who wished to form themselves into networks to identify and address their training needs; and strand C &ndash; research type projects which would support the aims and objectives of the training networks programme.</P>
    <P>I understand that over 150 applications were received from the first call for proposals and that, following an assessment process, approximately 40 projects have been approved for funding by the Skillnets board. However, as Skillnets is a private limited company, I have no function in regard to the assistance it provides to individual companies or networks.</P>

      <P>The numbers of work permits issued by my Department in respect of the employment of non-European Economic Area nationals in each of the past three years, broken down by nationality, is set out in the following tables.</P>
      <P>Work permits have been issued in respect of asylum seekers only since the Government decision of 26 July last allowing certain categories of asylum seekers to work, pending final determination of their cases. Since that date a total of 42 permits have been issued by my Department in respect of such persons and a further 11 permits have now been approved and will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>Our Department's system of prudential supervision of insurance companies is based primarily on the examination of the detailed financial returns which they must make to us each year, complemented by written correspondence and meetings with company representatives. In respect of the 1998 financial year, all of the <Col N="1326" /> returns received were subjected to tests to show that each company had an adequate solvency margin. The returns of 82 companies &ndash; 77 per cent of the total &ndash; were subjected to more detailed scrutiny. Queries arising from a number of these examinations were dealt with in writing, orally and in meetings with company representatives either in our Department or at the offices of the companies concerned.</P>
      <P>In addition, in 1998, a detailed examination of sales practices and sales conduct in Irish Life was undertaken by our departmental officials. The report of this examination was published by the insurance division earlier this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drafting has recently concluded in my Department on an insurance Bill which has the following purposes: (a) to allocate regulatory responsibility <Col N="1327" /> for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank of Ireland and to utilise the regulatory powers available to the bank under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995; (b) to enable the Minister to make disclosure regulations to require insurance undertakings and intermediaries to make relevant information of a specified nature available to insurance consumers; (c) to prescribe a system of notification by reinsurance undertakings and to enable the Minister to make regulations for the authorisation and supervision of reinsurance undertakings and (d) to update existing provisions for offences and penalties and to enhance the powers of &ldquo;authorised officers&rdquo; for the purposes of the Insurance Acts and regulations.</P>
    <P>Work on this Bill commenced separately and well in advance of the establishment of the implementation advisory group for the single regulatory authority. I am satisfied that the enactment of the legislation will have no implications for either the functions or structure of the proposed authority.</P>

      <P>The operation of all petrol retail outlets is covered by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) Regulations, 1979 SI No. 311 of 1979) as amended by the Dangerous Substances (Retail and Private Petroleum Stores) (Amendment) Regulations, 1988 SI No. 303 of 1988). These regulations outline the licensing arrangements for petroleum stations as required under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy's question of 19 May 1999, I am proposing to repeal the existing regulations and replace them with a new set of regulations. These will be risk assessment based in nature, imposing general duties on kerbside petrol station operators to store and dispense petrol in a safe manner. It is intended that the new regulations will be supported by codes of practice developed by the health and safety authority in conjunction with the petroleum industry. <Col N="1328" /> It is also proposed to give enhanced enforcement powers to licensing authorities, usually the relevant local authority, to deal directly with non-compliance.</P>
    <P>The proposed new arrangements should allow for the licensing of a significant number of existing kerbside petrol stations, reflecting an equivalent level of safety based on enhanced site management controls being put in place in conjunction with an assessment of the risks from storing and dispensing petrol. The Health and Safety Authority has undertaken some field trials using the proposed risk assessment method and believes that many of these types of petrol stations will be allowed to remain in operation. However, there remains a possibility that some stations may still be unable to meet the necessary safety requirements and may, therefore, have to cease operations.</P>
    <P>A draft of the new regulations is currently being examined by the Attorney General's office. However, in the event that the regulations are not finalised by 31 December 1999, it is my intention to extend the current deadline. Notification of this extension will be advertised in the national newspapers.</P>

      <P>Rental levels are dictated by the marketplace. The rise in commercial rents in Dublin is a feature of the spectacular economic growth we have experienced over the past few years and is a cause for concern. The National Development Plan 2000-2006, contains a number of initiatives designed to alleviate the pressure on both commercial and residential costs and to ensure that the enterprises in the services sector, both large and small, continue to make an important contribution to our future economic growth. In particular, the emphasis on improvement in our transport infrastructure, the provision of water and waste water services for development of land for commercial use and the strategy to develop counter-balances to Dublin, relieving pressure on the capital and distributing growth more widely throughout the south-east region, are all examples of how the plan will help in this context.</P>

      <P>Ireland continues to remain an attractive location for overseas investment. Overseas companies have more than doubled their annual rate of job creation in the last ten years. In 1998 a total of nearly 16,000 jobs were created by IDA Ireland backed companies &ndash; the highest ever job creation outcome in one year.</P>
      <P>The basic reasons for this success are our stable climate of social partnership, a favourable tax environment for overseas companies, an adequate supply of skilled, relatively young and well educated labour, a good telecommunications infrastructure, a generous system of grant assistance by the IDA and deregulation of certain sectors.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that Ireland can continue to be an attractive location for overseas companies. The main reasons for this are Government plans for continued investment in our infrastructural base and the continued stability of our economy.</P>
      <P>There is no room for complacency in this matter as there are a number of competitiveness issues facing us as we approach the next century. Labour shortages are increasingly appearing in a range of employments and skill shortages could act as a serious constraint on future growth. Other factors also have a bearing on investment location, such as housing market problems, quality of telecommunications facilities, costs generally and, very importantly, the need to maintain and enhance social partnership. The Government is actively addressing all these issues and is determined to ensure that Ireland will maintain its competitiveness and its attractiveness as an investment location over the coming years.</P>

    <P>Nineteen ninety eight was the fifth successive year of strong economic growth and this is reflected not only in the above figures but in job creation throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>Sound macro-economic management and policy developments which help make Ireland an attractive location for enterprise continue to have a strong positive impact on employment creation. Data from the CSO's quarterly national household survey indicate that the employment creation in the broader economy is also continuing at a significant rate. Between the second quarter of 1998 and the comparable period in 1999 an additional 96,600 jobs were created. In the same period unemployment fell by 29,700.</P>
    <P>Job losses must be seen in the context of overall strong economic growth, declining unemployment and sustained employment expansion throughout the economy. Employment is dependent on the success or failure of individual firms in the market economy and it is inevitable that some firms will fail, as indeed, many are thriving, expanding and generating additional employment. All the recent forecasts suggest that the economy is set for continued strong growth.</P>

      <P>The National Competitiveness Council, established under Partnership 2000, provides detailed assessments on all aspects of our national competitiveness, including that of Irish products traded on world markets. Both the council's 1999 annual competitiveness report and its report on costs, published this summer, provide detailed analysis of our impressive trade performance in recent years. They also draw attention to the continuing need to diversify our market penetration, both in terms of country and sector, and the scope for an expansion in our trade in services.

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Concerns about the level of premiums for motor insurance and public liability insurance have caused our Department to examine the factors contributing to the relatively high level of those premiums. This has focused on a number of the key cost elements including the levels of personal injury compensation and the costs associated with settling compensation claims. Concurrent with this examination, efforts are being made to identify measures which both individually and cumulatively could have a moderating effect on insurance costs.</P>
      <P>The 1996 Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs found that the main contributory factors to rising premium costs were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements, the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general damages awards relative to special damages in smaller claims. Following consideration by Government of the consultants' report and recommendations, a special working group was set up to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and to examine issues surrounding alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions. The special working group completed the first part of its remit last year and recommended a structure for a voluntary mediation system for occupational injuries which could be operated within the reformed courts system. The group will present its second report shortly. In the light of these reports and after consultations with the new Courts Service, a follow up to the work of this group will be considered.</P>
      <P>In addition, I re-established the Motor Insurance Advisory board last year, to provide information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater attention to safety in the workplace and on the roads can further reinforce insurance cost reduction measures taken at Government <Col N="1332" /> level. Accordingly, last year I launched the voluntary code of practice adopted by the initiative on workplace safety group established in May 1996, a group representing the key players in the area of accident prevention and claims mitigation chaired by IBEC, with representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, ICTU, the Health and Safety Authority and IBEC. A number of initiatives are in place and are being taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among all drivers, including young drivers. The Irish Insurance Federation, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, has introduced a scheme of insurance premium discounts for the young driver on completion of a required number of driving lessons. The National Safety Council, in co-operation with the Garda Síochána, continues to promote anti-speeding and anti-drink driving media campaigns, including road safety educational programmes for secondary school students.</P>

These regulations provide protection when a principal withdraws from a written agreement entered into between the principal and the com<Col N="1334" /> mercial agent, and they entitle a commercial agent to compensation when such a contract is ended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of all workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with workplace health and safety. The 1989 Act places the primary &ldquo;duty of care&rdquo; for the safety, health and welfare at work of employees on the employer in the first instance. This applies to all workplace health and safety matters, including such issues as workplace stress, violence and bullying.</P>
      <P>Under section 12 of the 1989 Act, every employer is obliged to prepare a written safety statement. This statement should be based on an identification of the hazards, and an assessment of the risks, to safety and health at the place of work and should also specify how the safety, health and welfare of workers is to be secured. The authority encourages all employers to use the process of preparing a safety statement to examine both the physical and psychological risks to workers, and to ensure that the workplace is structured and managed in such a way so as to ensure that workers are not placed under extreme levels of stress which may have a negative or detrimental effect on their physical and psychological well being.</P>
      <P>The authority has produced a booklet on the prevention of stress at work and it is intended that this will be revised during the current year. A separate booklet on bullying at work is also available from the authority.</P>
      <P>On the subject of workplace bullying, the Deputy may be aware that I recently set up a task force on the prevention of workplace bullying. The task force is being chaired by an independent chairperson &ndash; Dr. Eileen Doyle &ndash; and is operating under the auspices of the health and safety authority. The task force is examining workplace bullying in detail and is focusing on identifying the size of the problem and the employment sectors most at risk, as well as developing proposals for practical programmes and strategies, both to prevent workplace bullying, and to provide a more appropriate streamlined response from the relevant State agencies. The task force is due to report back to me in March 2000.</P>

      <P>The European single market gives the right to any firm within the European Union to establish retail outlets in other member states and to source freely their supplies from within the EU. This is a right which many Irish firms are exploiting very successfully, both in terms of establishing businesses in other member states and in supplying the single market. Once the relevant provisions of EU competition law are respected and single market rules adhered to, it is open to all companies to source their products anywhere within the EU. I have no reason to believe that Irish suppliers are at a disadvantage relative to other suppliers.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that Irish suppliers can avail of the opportunities which the increasing number of overseas firms in the Irish retail market provide. To this end, Enterprise Ireland administers a supplier development programme which determines, at an individual company level, the appropriate changes required to assist Irish suppliers to respond to the challenges arising from the structural change under way in the market and to take advantage of the new opportunities arising.</P>

The position as I outlined at that time remains substantially unchanged. However, in April 1998, I did grant an extension of two years to the prospecting licence holder in order to give the holder sufficient time to allow the economic feasibility of exploiting the deposit to be assessed. That work is ongoing. The technical staff of my Department has been satisfied with the progress made on exploration and extraction studies to date and will continue to closely monitor the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this, as in any other case, a State mining <Col N="1337" /> facility would only be granted where I am satisfied that the mine would be commercially successful. As the Deputy is aware, planning permission would also have to be obtained from the local authority, and an integrated pollution licence from the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>I believe that an economically viable mine operating to best practice standards is a prerequisite to an environmentally sound operation and for the generation of sustainable employment in the region. Whether a complementary industry is set up is a long-term consideration, but I would certainly encourage any opportunity for further employment in the area.</P>

      <P>While I am not aware of any representations to me from fishing clubs in Cork Harbour concerning the specific issue of conger eel conservation, I have recently responded to representations from the Cork Angling Association concerning the status of certain fish stocks in the Cork coastal region. The association forwarded to me extracts from a survey of attitudes in relation to the causes of stock declines and measures to address these declines. The conger eel was one of a number of stocks considered in the survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the findings in that survey were consistent with those published in the recent report by BIM on the inshore fisheries sector. I had asked BIM to undertake a study in order to address deficiencies in relation to quantitative data and economic analysis of the inshore fisheries sector, including sea angling, with a view to informing future development strategies for <Col N="1338" /> inshore fisheries resources. The report lists a number of stock conservation measures suggested by fishermen in the Cork area and these will be fully examined during the implementation process.</P>
    <P>Conger eel conservation was discussed in detail at the seminar on inshore fisheries and sea angling on 5 November last in Cork. A paper on the biology of conger eels was also presented at the seminar by UCC and the Marine Institute. This paper concluded that further knowledge of the biology of the conger eel was required in order to inform stock management. The UCC and Marine Institute study is set to continue and will be considered in due course by the national inshore fisheries advisory committee which I have announced to, among other matters, advise on management strategies for inshore stocks in general.</P>

      <P>I am aware of concerns regarding the need to ensure minimum standards in respect of ground handling services at airports. I have received considerable correspondence on the subject, as have other Ministers and Deputies.</P>
      <P>Regulations to implement the ground handling directive were signed by me on 16 December 1998. The directive does not set out any minimum standards with regard to ground handling services. When airlines use subcontractors to provide ground handling services, it is the airlines' responsibility, in the first instance, to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the standards, procedures, equipment and training of the service provider. In Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority is the regulatory body responsible for the safety and technical aspects of civil aviation and it monitors the activities of airlines in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Companies providing ground handling services are subject to the health and safety legislation in the normal manner and to the by-laws in force at airports as regards safe working practices. Where <Col N="1341" /> the provision of ground handling services does not impinge on aircraft safety, such as catering supplies or aircraft cabin cleaning services, it is the responsibility of the existing agencies such as the regional health board's environmental health service for food safety, the Health and Safety Authority for safe work practices and the Environmental Protection Agency, to enforce the legal standards in the same manner as for any other industrial activity or service in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The general standards which airport authorities require ground handling companies to meet will be in addition to the regulatory requirements set out above.</P>

      <P>The recently announced national development plan includes significant provisions in relation to the accessibility of public transport, including the establishment of a public transport accessibility committee which will advise on the accessibility aspects of existing and proposed public transport infrastructure, facilities and services. The committee will also make recommendations for prioritised cost effective measures to address these issues. The committee will be chaired by my Department and will include representatives of the CIE operating companies, the proposed National Disability Authority and <Col N="1342" /> organisations representing mobility impaired and disabled people.</P>
      <P>It is the established policy of Iarnród Éireann that all new trains and stations, together with major refurbishment projects at existing stations, should take account of the needs of mobility impaired customers. From 2000, all new buses purchased by Dublin Bus will be low floor and fully accessible and it is Bus Éireann's intention to purchase low floor accessible large capacity single deck buses when replacing its urban fleet.</P>
      <P>The Government recently decided that a review of the 1932 Road Transport Act should be undertaken with a view to the introduction of competition in Dublin public bus transport services. The review is expected to be completed in February 2000 and will, of course, take account of accessibility issues.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus operate the following procedures to accommodate persons with disabilities: aircraft specifications require that a certain number of seats are accessible for wheelchair passengers, provision is made for the carriage of wheelchairs, toilets on long range aircraft are wheelchair accessible, special wheelchairs are made available to conform with aisle widths on aeroplanes and passengers unable to walk are transferred to aircraft by paramedics.</P>
      <P>With regard to Aer Rianta, it is the company's policy to ensure that the design and provision of facilities at the three State airports are user friendly and accessible to all, including persons with disabilities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 165 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service commitment scheme was intro<Col N="1344" /> duced in 1997 for pilot officers of the Air Corps. From the outset, the scheme applied primarily to experienced personnel who were currently rated on and flying the Gulfstream IV, Beechcraft, CASA and Dauphin Aircraft, which are the principal operational aircraft, in the Air Corps. The scheme was introduced with a view to assisting in the retention in service of senior pilots in key appointments in areas such as search and rescue, maritime surveillance and ministerial air transport. The gratuities available under the scheme were designed to strike a fair and reasonable balance between the demands of the external commercial environment and the need to exercise responsibility in relation to public service pay. Such financial incentives are not uncommon in defence forces in other countries where similar difficulties exist in retaining highly qualified and readily marketable personnel. The scheme, moreover, was perceived to offer a more acceptable avenue of approach for all concerned than the imposition of any compulsory retention.</P>
    <P>The service commitment scheme was introduced for a two year period and I am satisfied that, as a significant incentive scheme, it has helped both to stabilise the drain of key pilots from the Air Corps and to create an environment of some predictable certainty for the medium term future in that regard. A total of 17 pilots had opted to participate under the terms of the service commitment scheme by the time of closure of the scheme at the end the original two year period of sanction. Application for entry to the scheme was, of course, entirely voluntary in nature.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps, having reviewed the operation of this scheme, are to bring forward proposals in relation to the retention of pilots and their proposals are now awaited.</P>

      <P>The 1998 Price Waterhouse report on the Air Corps and the Naval Service set out a range of recommendations for more effective and efficient air and sea services. Some of these recommendations could be proceeded with fairly quickly while others would take longer to implement. It is important that the recommendations be implemented in a structured and coherent way that will contribute to the overall development of the Defence Forces as a whole. That is why, in October 1998, I directed the chief of staff to arrange for the general officer commanding the Air Corps and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service to submit implementation plans that would give effect to the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations in the Price Waterhouse report.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan 1996-1998, which was approved by Government in March 1996, provides for a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the first line reserve made up of former members of the Permanent Defence Forces, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November 1997 I announced the setting up of a joint civilian/military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process, the chief of staff established a military board to <Col N="1350" /> conduct a study of the reserve. Part of the function of the steering group was to oversee and guide the military board in its task.</P>
      <P>Military boards are convened from time to time by the chief of staff to examine and report to him on various military matters and reports of such boards are not published. Accordingly, the military authorities do not propose to publish the final report of the military board convened by the chief of staff to conduct the study of the reserve. In May 1999 the military board presented a copy of its final report to the steering group for consideration. On 2 September 1999 when the steering group had completed its review of the reserve, including consideration of the military board report, it submitted to me a draft report which I am currently in the process of examining.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of consideration of the draft report I do not intend to make any comment on the findings or recommendations contained in the report, or on the procedures that will be necessary to implement such findings or recommendations. As I have indicated previously, I plan to publish the steering group report in due course.</P>

      <P>The arrangements governing the deduction of rations are provided for in Defence Force regulations. Under normal arrangements a marriage certificate is required from a reservist in order to confirm marital status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, following consultation with representatives of the personnel of An Fórsa <Col N="1352" /> Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association was established in July 1992. The association represents its members in discussions with the Department of Defence on matters concerning their remuneration and certain other conditions of service. Rates of allowances, including deductions for rations, come within the scope of representation. Accordingly, this is a matter which comes within the remit of RDFRA and which can be dealt with under the representative arrangements which have been agreed with the association. The subject has been raised by the association, and at a meeting with officials of my Department only last week, it was indicated to the association that the examination of the existing arrangements was nearing completion. I hope to be in a position to finalise the matter shortly.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of an interim national commonage framework plan introduced in October 1998, farmers with commonage land in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, and Kerry, who were not then participating in the rural environment protection scheme, were obliged to reduce their ewe numbers by up to 30 per cent of their existing permanent quota. As a result, up to 30 per cent of their permanent quota was frozen pending the completion of detailed commonage framework plans for the individual commonages.</P>
      <P>These detailed commonage framework plans will determine the percentage destocking, if any, required on the commonages in question, and this will determine the amount of quota, if any, that will be restored to those farmers whose quotas have been reduced. The process used in the preparation of these plans is more complex than originally anticipated. It is not possible to state definitively when all plans will be completed but the situation is under active review.</P>

      <P>Leader is the EU community initiative for rural development. European Commission guidelines on a new Leader initiative, termed Leader plus, have recently been agreed by member states. The Commission expects to finalise the details of the new programme next month.</P>
      <P>Member states will then have to draw up operational programmes for Leader plus. When completed, Ireland's operational programme will be forwarded to the Commission for approval with a view to commencement of the Leader plus programme as soon as possible. Until the working parameters are defined, I am not in a position to comment on the areas in which the new programme will operate, or the basis on which groups might be approved for funding.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan, funding of the order of £110 million will be available to support Leader type activity in the period 2000-06. Some £35.4 million of this is to be provided by the EU in respect of the Leader plus programme. The balance will come from the national Exchequer and will comprise national co-funding for Leader plus as well as support for a mainstream Leader type measure. Total funding for the Leader II programme amounted to some £98 million.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 26 beef cows under the 1999 beef cow scheme. His entitlement of £1,299.54 under this scheme was recouped by my Department due to an over-payment which had occurred under the rural environment protection scheme. As he did not lodge a 1998 area aid application he was not entitled to payment under the 1998 beef cow scheme, in accordance with clause 22 of the terms and conditions governing that scheme.</P>

    <P>In relation to the winter fodder scheme, the person named did not lodge an application under the 1998 ewe premium or sheep headage schemes and did not hold a milk quota at 1 April 1998.

Therefore he did not qualify for assistance under the winter fodder scheme.

      <P>In addition, the inspection established that he was only entitled to payment on eight cows under the suckler cow scheme as one of the animal tag numbers applied on had been duplicated . It was also established that the tag numbers of two animals on the herdowner's cattle headage application were duplicated. Therefore, he is entitled to payment on eight beef cows and eight other cattle under the cattle headage scheme. A letter issued to the applicant on 17 November 1999 notifying him of the decision taken. This letter provides for a 21 day period for the applicant to seek a review of the decision.

      <P>Under the terms and conditions of the scheme of early retirement from farming, payment of a pension can be authorised only from the date of receipt of a valid application. The date of receipt of a valid application is the date on which all core documentation is lodged with the local FDS office.</P>
      <P>When the application was examined in my Department, certain essential documentation was found to be lacking and the applicant was made aware of this and asked to provide it. The last of the requested information was not sent back until 17 September and, accordingly, that was deemed to be the date of valid application.</P>
      <P>In cases where there are major items of core documentation missing, applications are not deemed to be valid until all this documentation has been furnished. In the circumstances of this case, there are no grounds for backdating the payment of the pension to the original date of application.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>National and EU legislation provide that cattle must at all times, including the situation to which the Deputy refers be accompanied by valid passport documents-cattle identity cards and these must always be available for inspection by an authorised officer of the Department and-or the Garda Síochána. These documents do not denote ownership of the animals in question.</P>
      <P>The leasing of slatted houses or parts thereof is a private contractual arrangement between the parties concerned. Apart from being a legal requirement, the transfer of identification documents in this context should in the herdowner's own interests, form an integral part of such arrangements.</P>
      <P>In addition, each movement of a bovine animal off its parent holding must be recorded on the on-farm herd register of both the old and new locations. The owner-manager of the leased premises legally becomes the temporary keeper of the animal.</P>

This issue has to be considered in the light of the relevant veterinary regulations, the detailed rules governing the premium schemes under agenda 2000 and the integrated administration and control system. In the case of the integrated administration and control system, proposals for amendment to the relevant EU council and commission regulations are under discussion. It is expected that these discussions will be finalised very shortly following which decisions on the issue raised will be taken.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for special beef premium on 24 animals on 6 January 1999. Three of the animals were ineligible for 22 month premium as they did not reach age of eligibility for premium until 15, 18 and 20 January 1999 respectively. All animals were slaughtered under the BSE depopulation scheme on 12 January 1999, and compensation based on the market value at time of slaughter of the animals issued to the herdowner. Under the EU regulations governing the special beef premium scheme animals do not qualify for payment until they have reached the age of eligibility. Therefore three of the 24 animals did not qualify for 22 month premium. Payment is currently being processed on the remaining 21 animals. These 21 animals have been excused the two month retention period requirement for special beef premium applications on the grounds of <i>force majeure</i>, that is, circumstances that are unforeseen, unavoidable and outside the producer's control such as slaughter under the disease eradication schemes.</P>

      <P>The townlands in question were considered by the disadvantaged areas appeals panel as part of its overall examination of areas for reclassification as more severely handicapped. The criteria used to assess areas for more severely handicapped status were agreed between the disadvantaged areas appeals panel, <Col N="1368" /> the farming organisations and my Department, as follows: income had to be less that 60 per cent of national average income; land quality had to be four or lower on a scale of 0 to 9; and the area had to be contiguous to the existing more severely handicapped boundary.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission made it clear in discussions that the contiguity criterion would not be satisfied by areas which barely touched the existing MSH boundary and-or extended away from the boundary in long fingers of land.</P>
      <P>Aghadrumkeen, Aghnacue, Corranewy, Dernaroy, Drumate and Mullagreenan in DED Aghabog, Liscumiskey in DED Drumhillagh, and Drumgarley in DED Killeevan were all rejected because the income in each case exceeded the limit of 60 per cent of national average income. These townlands, except for Drumate, all adjoined the existing MSH area.</P>
      <P>Aghabog, Carolina, Drollagh, Mullymagaraghan and Rakeevan all satisfied the income criterion but did not adjoin the existing MSH boundary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The disease risk involved in the association of different groups of cattle on a commonage is not dissimilar to the situation arising in marts where animals are gathered together on a regular basis. Provided animals are of the same health status entering the commonage, there is no undue risk to the overall group.</P>
      <P>Eligible animals, females and bulls over 12 months of age, must, by law, be tested for brucellosis within 30 days of moving to a commonage and again within 30 days of returning to the main herd. If suitable testing facilities are not available on the commonage the animals should be isolated in the main farm on return and tested before mixing with other cattle in the herd.  It is strongly recommended, also, that all animals grazed on commonages are TB tested before they return to the main farm.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a herd number in the first instance each herdowner is required to have holding and handling facilities for their animals. There are no specific holding facilities required on commonages.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply of 9 November 1999 to Parliamentary Question No. 155, the 1999 area aid application for the person named was randomly selected for inspection. The applicant applied for a total of 24.25 hectares. A dispute over the right to claim parcel P16724023, one hectare, was resolved in favour of the person named and he has been given the credit for it. However, a number of other parcels were found to be overclaimed, which has lead to a total overclaim in this application of 9.46h. The area determined at inspection was 14.79 hectares. This represents a difference of 9.46 hectares or 63.96 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3 per cent, the penalty is based on double the difference when it is between 3 per cent and 20 per cent and when the difference is over 20 per cent, a 100 per cent penalty must be applied. Therefore in this case a full 100 per cent penalty must be applied and no area aid related payments can be made.</P>
      <P>The applicant signed the inspection at the time, certifying that the inspection procedure was explained to him and that he was satisfied it was carried out correctly.</P>

      <P>He was found to have made a false declaration on his ewe premium application and as a result he was not entitled to any ewe premium payment. However, the herdowner had already been paid the first instalment of the 1999 ewe premium and consequently he was notified of this overpayment.</P>
      <P>The 1999 suckler cow premium and cattle headage applications are presently being processed and payment will issue at an early date. This payment will be nett of any overpayments in relation to the ewe premium scheme. </P>

    <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, no penalty is applied when the difference is less than 3 per cent. Therefore in this case no penalty is applied leaving the area determined for payment at 46.28 hectares. Any payments due will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Council of Ministers have agreed that participants in the early retirement scheme will be paid compensation for the reduction in their pensions arising from the introduction of the euro. However, the approval of the European Commission is required before payment can be made. While my Department has been pursuing the issue as a matter of urgency, it has not been possible to secure the Commission's approval as early as had been hoped. It is now expected that approval will be given in December. Payment will then be made at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>A publican's licence (spirit retailer's on-licence) becomes due for renewal on 1 October each year and expires on the following 30 September. The new licence is issued by the Collector of Customs and Excise, on application. Section 49(1) of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, as amended by section 156 of the Finance Act, 1992, provides that licences may not be issued after 1 October 1992, unless a tax clearance certificate has been issued to the applicant.</P>
      <P>Tax clearance certificates are issued by the office of the Collector General of Revenue, Limerick, to those publicans who had received a certificate in the previous year and whose tax affairs are in order and up-to-date. A list of those publicans to whom tax clearance certificates are being issued automatically is sent to each collector of customs and excise in March or April. The collector then issues an application form for a tax clearance certificate to those publicans who do not appear on the list. In June of each year, the collector issues licence application forms to all licence holders. The application form when completed must be returned with a tax clearance certificate and the appropriate licence fee.</P>
      <P>A number of reminders are issued to traders who have not renewed by the due date. Publicans who have not renewed their licences by the due date are liable to prosecution for unlicensed trading. Licences are required to be renewed by 1 October However, during the following licensing period (i.e. 1 October to 30 September following the expiry of the licence) collectors of customs and excise are empowered to exercise a degree of discretion in the area of renewal based on administrative precedence. The collectors can only renew a licence to an applicant in respect of a premises which were licensed in the immediate preceding year. Where a licence has not been issued in the immediate preceding year (i.e. prior to 30 September), a Circuit Court certificate is then required for renewal of the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 49(a) of the of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, as amended by section 115 of the Finance Act, 1992, provides that where an application for a tax clearance certificate has been made before 1 June of the preceding licensing year, and the certificate has not yet been issued <Col N="1375" /> or refused, or it has been refused and the applicant has appealed against the refusal, then the licence may continue in force beyond its expiry date pending either the issue or refusal of the certificate, or the final determination of the appeal. In such circumstances, the proper duty on the licence must be deposited with the collector of customs and excise. It is important to distinguish between the authority granted to the customs and excise in the renewal of licences and the requirement to obtain a Circuit Court certificate. In the former situation, the renewal of the licence is limited to premises and persons duly licensed in the preceding year. Where this is not the case, the applicant must apply to the Circuit Court for a certificate leading to renewal of the licence. Where a trader has a problem in obtaining a tax clearance certificate, he should bring this to the immediate notice of the local collector of customs and excise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital acquisitions tax (CAT) code provides special relief for elderly siblings which takes <Col N="1376" /> account of the special circumstances of elderly brothers and sisters who live together. The effect of this relief means that the value of an inheritance of a share or all of their family, home taken from a sibling can be reduced by 80 per cent or £150,000, whichever is the lesser. Thus an individual, subject to the conditions of the relief being met, could currently inherit a half share in a house, with a market value of just over £257,000, before any CAT would be due.</P>
      <P>An individual, other than a child or certain grandchildren, can avail of the Class II threshold, currently £25,720 for the year 1999, when taking a benefit from a lineal relative. I have undertaken during the 1999 Finance Bill debate to review the CAT system in some detail before the next budget.</P>

      <P>The most significant item at this year's annual meetings was the endorsement by the interim committee and the development committee of significant enhancements and reforms to the HIPC initiative for those countries pursuing sound policies and committed to reform. The interim committee was re-named the international monetary and financial committee at the 1999 annual meetings. Ireland supports these enhancements, which involve lowering the debt sustainability thresholds, providing faster debt relief, shifting the focus of the initiative toward poverty reduction, and increasing, the number of countries expected to be eligible for debt relief.</P>
      <P>The most succinct summary of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank are contained in the communiqués issued by both institutions immediately after the annual meetings. It is not my intention to paraphrase these here. Instead, I have placed copies of both communiqués, and a copy of the joint statement of the co-chairmen of the interim and development committees, in the Dáil Library, together, with a copy of my address to the annual meetings.</P>
      <P>The joint communiqué of the interim and development committees deals with the HIPC initiative, and in particular with the enhancements made to this. It focused on three main areas: first, the reforms required to deliver deeper, broader and faster debt relief; second, strengthening the focus on poverty reduction in bank and fund programmes; and third, an overview of the financing arrangements that will allow the enhanced HIPC initiative to start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of poverty and development generally, both the World Bank and the IMF have signed up to an integrated approach based on poverty reduction. This is a very significant <Col N="1377" /> development which we have supported and, along with other members, we will be monitoring, how it develops in practice.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information, Ireland is not the only EU member state which has a tax on vehicle registration. Eight other countries have a registration tax, including Denmark, Finland, Greece and Portugal, some at higher levels than apply in Ireland. These taxes are operated in a variety of ways and, as such, are not directly comparable with vehicle registration tax &ndash; VRT &ndash; as applied here. Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and the UK do not charge registration tax and France and Italy charge the tax at a nominal rate. Many other countries also tax fuel at a higher rate, including the UK. There are no harmonisation proposals in discussion at EU level in relation to vehicle registration taxes. The question of derogation does not arise as there is no Community instrument preventing the imposition of VRT.</P>

      <P>The national year 2000 emergencies co-ordination committee has met three times since its establishment: on 22 September, 28 October and 18 November, and will meet again on 16 December. The role of the committee is to oversee and co-ordinate the Year 2000 contingency preparations and emergency management arrangements of the key national utility, infrastructure, health, security, financial and business sectors, so as to mitigate potential disruptions to Irish society in the event of problems arising from Year 2000 related incidents and-or millennium celebrations. In particular the committee is requested to:</P>
      <P>(a)identify the interdependencies between the sectors represented on the committee;</P>
      <P>(b)co-ordinate activities between these sectors to ensure that their contingency preparations and emergency management arrangements includes adequate measures to deal with these interdependencies;</P>
      <P>(c)highlight areas of weakness in these preparations and arrangements, advise on further action required, and ensure that this advice is acted upon;</P>
      <P>(d)keep the Interdepartmental Committee on Major Emergencies briefed of developments which may require significant national action;</P>
      <P>(e)provide liaison between Ireland and other national governments and international bodies involved in Year 2000 contingency activities;</P>
      <P>(f)report to Government on the state of preparedness every two months; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(g)provide briefings to the press (through the Government Information Services) and publish information on the Government's central year 2000 web site on the state of <Col N="1381" /> contingency readiness to boost public confidence and allay fears.</P>
    <P>The committee reviewed the general state of readiness of the sectors, and has reviewed the information co-ordination and emergency management arrangements among the sectors in the light of the interdependencies between them. To facilitate and develop the review procedure, the committee established an emergency services sub-group and a financial services sub-group to further the work of identifying interdependencies between sectors and ensuring that effective information and management co-ordination procedures were in place. Based on the work of the sub-groups, the committee is satisfied with the state of readiness of the sectors and that co-ordination arrangements are in place between the key sectors.</P>
    <P>I am very satisfied with the work of the committee to date, the results of which will ensure that in the event of computer related incidents occurring over the Millennium changeover period, there will be a speedy and co-ordinated response to addressing them. The committee's work is still in progress with a view to ensuring that any disruptions that might arise will have minimum effects.</P>

After an intensive debate, the committee agreed that &ldquo;the regulation of traditional medicinal products clearly deserves attention; that there may be a case for sorting out existing problems through specific Community legislation; that any future legislation in this sector would have to take into account the fact that there is a very strong national component to this issue and that the possibilities for full harmonisation may be limited; and that the scope of the products concerned should be clearly defined and a possible future regulation should not serve as a safe haven for all sorts of non-effective products.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is clear from this that any Community proposals that may attempt to address the issue of traditional medicinal products (including any eligible herbal medicinal products) are a long way off. While it is recognised that there is little harmony between the member states and that there is little prospect of agreement being reached if an attempt to introduce a directive were made, at the same time it is recognised that public health must be protected and that while some form of &ldquo;traditional use&rdquo; claims might be acceptable in certain circumstances, there can be no compromise where safety and quality are concerned. The matter, therefore, continues under examination at EU level and the question of my revoking SI 271/99 does not arise at this stage.</P>

I understand that the Deputy has received a reply from the Mid-Western Health Board dated 15 November 1999 explaining that the individual referred to by the Deputy was placed on the treatment waiting list on 11 May 1999. The board explained in their letter that there is a shortage of appropriately qualified staff and this is limiting their ability to deal with the waiting list. At present, the board is deal<Col N="1384" /> ing with patients placed on the waiting list since June-July 1998 and the individual referred to by the Deputy will be given an appointment as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule. It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that it would cost about £22.5 million to extend medical card eligibility to children under five years. However, costs of other health and social services which may be made available without charge to medical card holders are not included in the estimate above. Loss of income from public hospital statutory charges, from which medical holders are exempt, would also have to be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>While recruitment of staff is primarily a matter for individual employers, a number of manpower planning initiatives are under way. The question of the medical staffing in hospitals is being examined by the medical manpower forum at the moment and the forum is preparing an interim report which will be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>In the course of the expert review group on certain allied health professions, employers acknowledged that there are recruitment difficulties with some of these professions. Officials of my Department have already met with many of the heads of these schools and are currently planning a manpower planning exercise to address these difficulties.</P>
      <P>The National Social Work Qualifications Board has begun a manpower planning initiative in relation to social workers, the results of which are expected by the end of this year. This report will recommend on how best to address the current recruitment difficulties in social work, and these recommendations will be followed up by both my Department and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> A manpower planning exercise is under way under the auspices of the review of psychology services group and is addressing the matter in both the short-term and medium-term. This group hopes to be in a position to enter into discussions with the training colleges early next year.</P>
    <P>With regard to nursing vacancies, the Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, is currently carrying out a study of the position at 30 September 1999.</P>
    <P>The principal difficulties relating to the recruitment and retention of nurses are concentrated in the Dublin area. While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the country, investment in hospitals and the development of regional specialities over recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area. Within Dublin, issues such as housing costs, traffic problems and lack of car parking facilities have been cited as disincentives to the recruitment and retention of nurses. These issues are not unique to nurses or to the health service. However, a range of initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it.</P>
    <P>These initiatives include the following: arrangements have been agreed with the nursing unions to allow more favourable assimilation arrangements on to pay scales for nurses taking up both permanent and temporary appointments; a significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units is being introduced; discussions with the nursing unions are continuing in relation to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff; standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions; the areas of term time working and annualised hours are the subject of ongoing discussions with staff representatives as an option for staff with family commitments; the availability of return to working courses for qualified nurses who have been out of the work force is being reviewed with a view to maximising uptake; the Department of Health and Children is currently engaged in discussions with health agencies in relation to the provision of specialist nursing courses at centres outside Dublin; an anti-bullying policy has been prepared and agreed with the nursing unions and is due to be published shortly; the promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing; and a Study of the Nursing and Midwifery Resource by the nursing policy division of the Department of Health and Children commenced last year with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs.</P>
    <P>Along with most employers today, the health service is experiencing staff shortages in a variety of areas. By and large the more significant problems are evident in Dublin. I do not intend to <Col N="1389" /> have an over-bureaucratic approach to this problem as the number of posts vacant changes from day to day. I have, instead, concentrated my energy on areas with the most significant problems.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board has been experiencing difficulties in the provision of services in its regional orthodontic department in St. James's Hospital over the past few months. I understand from the board that these difficulties were caused by the consultant orthodontist's unilateral decision to withdraw from the provision of orthodontic assessments, orthodontic opinions and the commencement of orthodontic appliance therapy for new patients. The position was exacerbated recently by the withdrawal of consultant cover and the consultant orthodontist's refusal to provide guidance to dental clinicians regarding orthodontic procedures.</P>
      <P>Despite negotiations and discussion at the highest level in the Eastern Health Board, the consultant orthodontist persistently refused to provide services as outlined above. I understand that the consultant orthodontist's actions led to her suspension from duty without pay with effect from 4 November 1999.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is now in the process of ensuring that appropriate arrangements are put in place to provide continuity of orthodontic services as heretofore. The board is in discussion with the Dublin Dental Hospital regarding the provision of consultant cover and it is anticipated that these discussions will reach a successful conclusion in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997, my predecessor announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
      <P>There are two central units located at St. Vincent's Hospital and at the Mater Hospital, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach. In addition, the use of mobile units by BreastCheck, the national breast screening board, will ensure that the screening service is accessible to all women in the target age group in these areas. My intention is to provide a top quality service which meets best international standards. I am satisfied that the careful planning and deliberation by the national breast screening committee over the past two years in relation to all aspects of the programme will ensure that we can offer a service which is underpinned by standards of excellence and one which will ultimately pay dividends in terms of reductions in mortality among women in the target population.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and the importance of ensuring that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. I am very aware of the unnecessary trauma and anguish that could be caused to women and their families as a result of mistakes in an organised screening programme. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice. Specifically, the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors, the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population, the on-going evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective and the availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1999 I announced the start up date of the programme as October 1999 and I am pleased to say that this target date has been met. The construction of both centres is almost complete and I understand that consent letters have now been issued to women on a batch basis. The essential staff to commence the high quality programme have now been recruited. State of the art <Col N="1391" /> equipment and an information technology system have also been purchased and installed. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place. The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>

      <P>The social services inspectorate which has been established on an administrative basis will concentrate for an initial three year period on child care services. Its initial inspection programme which will commence in January 2000 will focus on children's residential centres.

      <P>The Children Bill, 1999, which was published in September and is on the Dáil Order Paper awaiting Second Stage, provides for an amendment of the Child Care Act 1991, that will broaden the definition of a &ldquo;children's residential centre&rdquo; to include &ldquo;an institution for the care and maintenance of physically or mentally handicapped children&rdquo;. There will then be a statutory basis for inspecting such homes.</P>

      <P>The fluoridation of the public piped water supplies is an important programme for the protection of dental health and I do not propose to seek to repeal the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960 (No. 4 of 1960).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety and effectiveness of water fluori<Col N="1392" /> dation as a public health measure has been evaluated frequently by the World Health Organisation and other reputable authorities, such as the Health Research Council of the United States, and concerns about adverse health effects have not been substantiated. All of the reputable scientific evidence confirms the safety of fluoride when it is available in public piped water supplies at the optimal levels. These levels are the same as those required by the Act.</P>
    <P>Historically, a few countries decided not to proceed with the introduction of water fluoridation. The reasons for this were due to geographical and administrative local difficulties and in one or two places there were legal difficulties which were overcome by changes in the legislation. Where water fluoridation was not introduced fluoride was made available by other means, for example, fluoridated salt etc., to order to overcome the local difficulties referred to above. In many developed countries people do not drink water from the public supply and this was a factor in providing fluoride by other means.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268, 269 and 278 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of hospitals is a matter for local management in the first instance having regard to the level of service to be provided. The appointment of consultants is a matter for the health boards and voluntary hospitals in association with Comhairle na nOspidéal. The broader question of medical staffing in hospitals is being examined by the medical manpower forum which aims to ensure that high quality and safe hospital services are available to patients at all times; ensure that a fully trained doctor is available to all hospital patients as necessary at all times; ensure that there are sufficient doctors with appropriate training and expertise employed in relevant specialties and disciplines to meet the needs of the patients in the public hospital medical system at any given time; provide for comprehensive teaching, training and research opportunities for public hospital doctors to continue to reach and maintain appropriate standards of professional competence; recognise the important role played by hospitals in the provision of training for primary care and the need to continue and accommodate such training; ensure a professionally satisfying career structure which is capable of attracting and retaining sufficient doctors to meet the ongoing needs of the hospital medical system; develop flexible training, career and employment structures which meet the needs of both male and female doctors; facilitate and support continuing medical education so as to keep abreast of developments and maintain competence; and develop an appropriate employment and superannuation structure designed to support change and flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key recommendations is the creation of a new consultant grade to meet the serious gap in hospital medical staffing. The new consultant will be a fully qualified, fully trained and experienced doctor, with full clinical auton<Col N="1395" /> omy. It is proposed that this new consultant would be rostered so as to meet patient demand at all times. While the main purpose of the medical manpower forum is to improve hospital services for patients, major benefits will accrue to hospital doctors including changed work practices, greater career opportunities and improved teaching and training.</P>
    <P>The medical manpower forum has not submitted a report to date but is preparing an interim report which is nearing completion. This report will take into account the submissions made to the forum by various organisations.</P>

    <P>At my Department's request, the health board chief executive officers have established a group to plan the introduction into the primary childhood immunisation programme of the new conjugate vaccine to protect against group C meningococcal disease and for it to be given to older children and young people in a &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; programme. I understand that this group has had a meeting with the Irish Medical Organisation at which possible approaches to delivery of the vaccine were discussed. The IMO has not indicated <Col N="1396" /> to my Department or to the health boards that it wishes to link the dispute regarding the influenza vaccine with doctors' participation in the delivery of the group C vaccine.</P>
    <P>There remains disagreement between the Health Service Employers' Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation as to the arrangements which should apply to the provision of the influenza vaccine to general medical service patients. Nonetheless I welcome the statement by the IMO that, notwithstanding the dispute regarding administration of the influenza vaccine, it has advised its members to provide the vaccine to the at-risk groups in the GMS free of charge.</P>

The group was also of the opinion that improvements in data collection, surveillance, contact tracing and preventive therapy procedures should take place in order to inform future consideration of the issue.</P>
      <P>A national tuberculosis committee, under the chairmanship of my Department's deputy chief medical officer, was established in 1997 to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the 1996 report and to develop national strategy for the control and management of tuberculosis. The issue of the discontinuance of routine BCG immunisation is among those which the committee will keep under review.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the national blood transfusion service rests with the Blood Transfusion Service Board, BTSB. A report on the implications of centralising donation testing was prepared by the national medical director and the chief executive officer of the BTSB. This report which strongly recommended that the board should centralise donation testing was unanimously adopted by the board in July 1999. The board decided to proceed with the detailed planning for centralised testing and to address the concerns of medical practitioners in the Munster region. I have not received a submission from the board nor have I been in touch with the board in relation to this matter. A copy of the report which I have referred to was made available to my Department.</P>
      <P>I have made a commitment to invest additional capital resources in the BTSB's Munster centre and I understand that a planning brief is being prepared for consideration by the board. As soon as the board decides on the outline planning brief, I expect that a submission will be made to my Department for the necessary approval to progress the detailed planning of this project. My Department will respond to the board's submission as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>The provision of services is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. I understand from the board that the general procedure in its hospitals is that the patient is referred to a consultant by a GP's letter. Referral letters are reviewed by the consultant who classifies them as &ldquo;Urgent&rdquo;, &ldquo;Intermediate&rdquo; or &ldquo;Routine&rdquo;. I understand from the board that urgent cases will be seen at the next consultant's clinic. The board has confirmed that the current waiting time for a routine outpatient appointment is between two and a half and three and half years. The board has advised me that it is currently reviewing the operation of the outpatients department. The primary objective will be to establish ways in which the quality of the service to the public can be improved, while maximising the clinical value of the out-patient service.</P>
      <P>I have indicated recently that funding under the waiting list initiative will be increased again in 2000. The total funding in 1999 was £20 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 290 and 291 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that entitlement to a medical card is based on hardship rather than on any specification that a particular percentage of the population should have a card. The decrease in the percentage of the population with a card is a reflection of a general improvement in the economy in recent years.</P>

I understand from the board that this post is in addition to the existing service and will increase the number of sessions available in the school.</P>

      <P>In October 1998 I approved a capital grant of £700,000 for the construction of a coronary care unit at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny. I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board that planning permission was sought on 19 November 1999. In relation to the CT scan I understand from the board that planning application drawings and fire safety certificate application drawings are nearing completion following which an application for this development will be lodged with the planning authority.</P>
      <P>In relation to the community hospital, a project team has been established, involving representation from my Department, and work is ongoing on the preparation of a brief for this development.</P>

      <P>As explained in my response to the Deputy's question of 11 November 1999, the South-Eastern Health Board does not have a dental surgeon attached to St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, on a full-time basis. However, a dental surgeon provides a session of three hours one day per week in the day ward for children and adults.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board, in line with the experiences of the other boards, has had difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitably qualified dental practitioners. I understand from the board that as a result of this difficulty it is not possible to expand the dental service provided at St. Luke's at present and that the dental services provided there are limited. It was decided by the board that the most equitable solution to this situation was to confine the service to medical card holders.</P>
      <P>Patients with medical cards who are assessed in the board's community care clinics and who are deemed in need of treatment but who can not be treated under local anaesthetic are referred to St Luke's and are admitted in due course to the day ward there. The board assists patients who are without medical cards and who are in need of further treatment by referring them either to the Dublin Dental Hospital or to a suitable private practitioner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 302 and 303 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been actively engaged in co-ordinating and facilitating the work of health agencies who have teams in place to ensure that the health services will be year 2000 ready. Latest reports from hospitals and health boards indicate that all but a small number of computer systems are year 2000 compliant. Remedial work is ongoing as a priority in the case of the systems concerned. These agencies have definite plans in <Col N="1407" /> place to make the systems complaint in advance of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>My Department's year 2000 guidelines required all agencies to develop contingency plans as an added assurance in the event of computer systems failure. This work is currently being finalised in agencies in conjunction with plans to meet the expected increased demand for health services over the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I am confident that my Department's policy, which is to ensure that health service clients and staff should be protected from potential risks to health and safety arising from the millennium changeover and that there should be minimal disruption to normal health services, will be achieved.</P>
    <P>A contingency plan has been developed within my Department and this is in an advanced state of implementation. Given the nature of such plans my Department will maintain an ongoing review of the plan.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides the framework for an integrated investment strat<Col N="1411" /> egy to increase social housing output to meet rising needs. Under the plan it is estimated that the social housing needs of 90,000 households will be met through a range of measures including the provision of 35,500 local authority houses, the expansion of voluntary housing activity, the provision by local authorities of affordable housing, the shared ownership scheme as well as other complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock.</P>
      <P>The provision of 35,500 local authority houses is intended to make a significant contribution to meeting social housing needs within the lifetime of the plan and their delivery is front loaded having regard to the current level of assessed housing needs. I am satisfied that this level of an overall programme for the next seven years is appropriate in the circumstances. The Central Statistics Office's population and labour force projections 2001-2031 were taken into account in determining the likely overall level of housing requirements for the period of the plan.</P>
      <P>In the context of the four year multi-annual local authority housing programme 2000-2003, local authorities were asked to indicate the level of a programme which each authority felt was warranted and capable of being effectively implemented. The responses received from local authorities were taken into consideration by me together with the relative levels of need and progress on their existing programmes when I recently determined and notified programmes of new starts for each local authority.</P>

      <P>Refunds of motor tax can be made in circumstances when: the vehicle has been scrapped-destroyed or sent permanently out of the State; the vehicle has been stolen and has not been recovered by the owner; a vehicle in respect of which a tax disc has been taken out has not been used in a public place at any time since the issue of the disc; the owner of the vehicle has ceased because of illness, injury or other physical disability to use the vehicle; the owner of the vehicle has ceased because of absence from the State for the business or educational purposes to use the vehicle; or the owner of the vehicle has ceased, because of service overseas with the Defence Forces, to use the vehicle.</P>
      <P>In addition, the regulations require, for administrative reasons, that not less than a three month unexpired period remains on the disc from the date of refund. The question of reducing this period to one month will be considered at the next revision of the regulations. The proceeds from motor taxation are lodged into the local government fund.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic (Co-ordination of Roadworks) Regulations, 1992, the Dublin local authorities and the county boroughs of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway have powers to co-ordinate and control road openings by both public and private utilities to minimise the frequency and duration of road openings; to co-ordinate works to minimise traffic congestion and hazard to road users; and to ensure that roads are permanently reinstated as quickly as possible. Failure to comply with directions issued by a local authority is an offence for which the penalty is a fine not exceeding £1,000 and/or a prison term not exceeding 12 months in the case of a summary conviction; in the case of conviction on indictment, the penalty is a fine not exceeding £50,000 and/or a prison term not exceeding five years.</P>
      <P>The Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Seanad, proposes to enhance local authority powers by obliging telecommunications operators to obtain the consent of the local authority before opening a road to lay underground telecommunications infrastructure. Under section 15 of the Bill, a local authority would be empowered to make its consent subject to conditions including reduction in the number of telecommunications related road-openings by ensuring that road openings are co-ordinated, trenches are shared and spare ducts are laid for future use by other operators. Non-compliance with a direction given by a local authority under the Bill would be an offence. In the case of a summary conviction, the penalty would be a fine not exceeding £1,500 and-or a prison term not exceeding 12 months; in the case of a conviction on indictment, the penalty would be a fine not exceeding £10,000 and-or a prison term not exceeding two years.</P>
      <P>The concept of lane rental will be introduced by the National Roads Authority in connection with new urban road works contracts. Similar arrangements for the control of other operations involving occupation of road space may arise for consideration in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318 and 319 together.</P>
      <P>The local government audit service is responsible for 206 audits, including local authorities and other local bodies. The audits in respect of 1997 for Mayo County Council, Wicklow County Council and New Ross Urban District Council have not been completed. The following table contains a full listing of the audit status of local authorities' 1998 annual financial statements.</P>
      <P>Finalisation of the 1997 audit for Wicklow County Council awaits consideration and decision by the local government auditor concerned on a formal objection lodged in relation to expenditure incurred during the year in question. This matter is currently being examined by the local government audit service.</P>
      <P>In undertaking the audit of various bodies, local government auditors are independent in the exercise of their functions and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no function in this regard.</P>

      <P>I understand that almost 600 driving instructors are currently enrolled under the voluntary driving instructor register &ndash; which has received financial support from my Department and the Irish Insurance Federation. In the context of the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 my Department has provided additional financial assistance to the DIR which has enabled it to attain ISO 9002 certification. This quality certification should enhance confidence in, and recognition of, the DIR. The strategy for road safety also addressed the question of regulating private driving schools. It concluded that the DIR scheme should for the moment remain a voluntary one.</P>

      <P>Significant additional resources have been allocated to the driving test service in the past 12 months. The number of driver testers has been increased by over 50 per cent to 101.</P>
      <P>Most of the recent recruits to the driver testing service have been assigned to the Dublin area. Nearly 47 per cent of the total complement of driver testers currently employed by my Department are based in the Dublin region. In addition, two new driving test centres have recently been opened in the Dublin area. With these increased resources, improvements in waiting times are being realised.</P>
      <P>I do not anticipate that extra driver testers will be recruited for the Dublin area in the immediate future. However, the situation will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>Driver testers are recruited through open competition arranged by the Civil Service Commission as an independent body. The last competition conducted by the Civil Service Commission consisted of a psychometric test, a driving test and a competitive interview.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, empower local authorities to provide parking bays for people with disabilities and also provide for the issuing of parking permits, allowing the use of such bays, to a person suffering from a disability which prevents the person from walking or causes undue hardship to the person in walking. Both the parking bays involved and the parking permit include the white wheelchair-user symbol which is a standardised symbol at EU level and is specifically mentioned in the EU Council recommendation on a standardised parking card for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The appropriate form of words to be incorporated in legislation and regulations to refer to people with disabilities is a matter on which I will have regard to any advice from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or from the various voluntary agencies and interests concerned.</P>

      <P>Under the European Communities (Vehicle Testing) Regulations, 1991 to 1999, all buses and coaches over one year old are already required to undergo roadworthiness testing on an annual basis. Testing is carried out at test centres, including certain CIE centres, appointed and supervised by local licensing authorities. The test includes the checking of exhaust emissions.</P>
      <P>Article 30 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1998, requires vehicles to be so constructed as to prevent so far as is reasonably possible the emission of smoke, visible vapour, noxious gases or offensive odours. Article 90 of these regulations prohibits a person using a vehicle in such a manner as to emit fumes which could be prevented by the exercise of reasonable care. Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>

There is no basis, therefore, on which the long service increments may be passed on to the pensions of former town clerks who retired before 1 June 1997 or to the pensions of town clerks who retire after that date without sufficient qualifying service at the maximum of the new scale.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 335 and 343 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to people under age 66 who are recipients of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance; invalidity pension; blind person's pension; disability allowance; unemployability supplement or workmen's compensation with disablement pension for at least 12 months or a social security invalidity pension/benefit or an equivalent payment, for at least 12 months, from a country covered by EC regulations or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, widows/widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, including free travel, retain that entitlement. At the end of October 1999, over 550,000 free travel passes had been issued and the <Col N="1423" /> estimated cost of the free travel scheme in 1999 is approximately £34.5 million.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children operate a mobility allowance scheme to provide financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport. This allowance is available to applicants over age 16 and under age 66 years and may be used to finance taxi journeys. That Department also administers the motorised transport grant scheme to provide financial assistance to disabled persons who may need a car to obtain or retain employment or who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems. Issues in relation to this area are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>A fundamental review of the free schemes of this Department is being carried out to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. This includes an examination of the qualifying conditions for the schemes, the target groups and the scope for alternative policy arrangements. The issues of access to transport for people with disabilities and extending the free schemes to all widow/widowers are also being addressed in the review. The conclusions of the review which is available in draft form are being considered in the context of budget 2000.</P>
    <P>The review of the free schemes is being carried out by an official of my Department on secondment as a visiting research fellow at the Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin. It is expected that the research conducted will be formally published by the policy institute in the &ldquo;Trinity Studies in Public Policy&rdquo; series in January 2000.</P>

    <P>The current staff complement in the information systems division of my Department is 270. This includes software development and maintenance staff, computer operations, networks and other IT support and administrative staff. From 1 <Col N="1424" /> January 1999 to date, 33 staff have left the division for various reasons. Of these, 12 resigned from the Civil Service. The average age of the remaining staff is 36.</P>
    <P>The loss of skilled IT staff is an area of concern for Departments, including my own, which have a high dependence on information technology to do their business. A number of possible measures aimed at retaining skilled staff are under consideration on a Civil Service wide basis. In addition, within my own Department, the question of IT staff recruitment, working environment, communications and training and other measures are being considered and strategy to address these issues is being drawn up in consultation with staff in the IS division and with other relevant bodies and agencies.</P>
    <P>As part of a Civil Service-wide set of once-off, exceptional measures to retain key skilled IT staff, a bonus is to be paid to certain staff working on the year 2000 compliance project.</P>
    <P>The bonus will be paid to staff with the necessary IT skills who worked on remedial work in relation to the project and who are still serving in the Civil Service in April 2000. The bonus will be payable at a rate of £7,500 per annum, subject to a maximum period of 18 months. Staff working on the project for 18 months and longer will receive a maximum bonus of £11,250 before tax. Other staff who worked on the project for shorter durations will receive a<i> pro rata</i> amount based on a smaller number of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period 21 April 1998 to 21 November 1999, my Department received a total of 847 requests under the Freedom of Information Act 1997; 767 were requests for personal information and 80 were requests for information of a non-personal nature.</P>
      <P>There are two members of staff working solely on freedom of information in the FOI support unit. In addition, staff engaged in the administration and management of the Department's business devote time to requests under the FOI legislation as and when required. There are 95 officers, including reserve officers and internal reviewers, who make decisions under the Act under these arrangements. Similarly, clerical staff are diverted from their normal duties for search and retrieval of records as required.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are designed to ensure that requests are processed efficiently and on a cost-effective basis. They are being actively monitored, and as in the case of other areas of the Department's activities, staffing levels are subject to adjustment having regard to overall business requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requests for non-personal information related to the commercial activities of the Department; reports prepared by or for the Department related to ongoing policy development; my expenses as Minister and those of specified staff members; the minutes of the management advisory committee; the numbers of applications for certain schemes run by the <Col N="1426" /> Department; and details of performance awards made to staff.</P>
    <P>Fees are not sought in the case of requests for personal information, which form 90 per cent of the requests received. Fees have been sought in a small number of cases where requests for non-personal information involve large numbers of records, where information has been sought for commercial reasons or where multiple requests have been received from the same person. In these cases, the requests are not processed until the fees are paid.</P>
    <P>Many of the requests for personal information have arisen in the context of appeal hearings or requests for explanation of decisions. The provision of information under this legislation has given rise to increased costs for my Department but estimates of the costs involved have been made only in cases where fees are being sought. Where fees are charged, the costs which are recoverable under the legislation are limited to the time expended in search and retrieval of records and the cost of copying the records. No charge can be made for the time taken in examining the records for exempt material, consultation with third parties, decision-making or processing appeals to internal review or to the information commissioner. The fees received represent a relatively small part of the cost of providing the service but this is in part due in large measure to the nature of the business in which my Department is engaged.</P>

      <P>Currently within my Department there are 150 buildings which are open to the public. A total of 105 of these are accessible to people with disabilities. Early in 2000 this will increase to 108.</P>
      <P>These buildings include local offices, investigators' offices and headquarters buildings which have a public office. Excluded are citizens information offices which, although funded by my Department, are community based.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made in recent years in improving and upgrading the general standard and access facilities of my Department's offices. This process of upgrading will continue.</P>
      <P>In respect of the 42 buildings not regarded as being fully accessible to people with disabilities, upgrading will ensure that these buildings are accessible to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This upgrading is being systematically undertaken, within the constraints of available technical and financial resources, as part of my Department's building and refurbishment programme. <Col N="1427" /> In addition, where refurbishment is neither practical nor appropriate, my Department is taking opportunities to provide accommodation at alternative locations.</P>
    <P>All office upgrades and refurbishment are undertaken in conjunction with the Office of Public Works which ensures that compliance with standards regarding access are adhered to. Where offices are inaccessible to people with disabilities, arrangements can be made to visit such people in their homes.</P>
    <P>My Department also has 70 branch offices which are operated by branch managers who are employed on a contract basis. Under the terms of the contract they are required to provide suitable accommodation. A recent survey of branch offices revealed that over half did not satisfy the criteria in relation to accessibility for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>However, my Department has recently concluded an agreement with the branch managers in relation to their future role and their remuneration. Included in this agreement is the requirement that specific criteria be met in terms of the standard of accommodation provided by the branch manager and in this regard they will be required to make the premises accessible to people with disabilities within a reasonable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 341 and 342 together.</P>
      <P>The one parent family payment is a social assistance payment which is intended to meet the income support needs of lone parents in general. In common with other schemes of this nature supports for those taking part in education and training schemes are provided as a substitute for, or in some cases, as an extra allowance in addition to their basic social welfare payment. It is considered that this is the most suitable and practical way of delivering this support and, accordingly, increases in OFP for this purpose would not be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> The Department is anxious to see lone parents improving their standard of education and to this end they are eligible for the back to education allowance which applies to people participating on second level certificate courses, VTOS, post leaving certificate courses and third level courses. Lone parents participating on these schemes continue to receive their OFP, a cost of education allowance at the start of the academic year and also retain any entitlement they might have to secondary benefits such as rent supplement.</P>
    <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a weekly supplement may be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by health boards. Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources. Applicants are also required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>In the case raised by the Deputy, the person concerned was in receipt of a rent supplement from 26 January 1998 to 9 November 1999 when she commenced a FÁS course. She is not yet attending a course which qualifies for the back to education allowance. Rather, she is participating on a foundation certificate course with FÁS and is receiving a training allowance of £76.30 per week in addition to her one parent family payment of £88.70 per week. While her rent is £85 per week the maximum rent supplement for her family size is £70 per week. Her total income of £165 per week is £79.80 in excess of the relevant SWA rate for her family size so she is not eligible for a rent supplement.</P>
    <P>FÁS training allowances are assessed in full as means for the purpose of determining entitlement to a rent or mortgage supplement and there is no automatic retention of rent supplement. In that regard, the conditions for retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements, including the income limits and the ceilings on the amounts payable, are currently being reviewed in consultation with the social partners under Partnership 2000. Any changes would, of course, have to be decided in a budgetary context.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the way in which people can invest their money to make a return to achieve the 7.5 per cent return calculated by his Department on an investment of £20,000 for means test purposes on non-contributory pensions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the current formula which is used for the assessment of capital for non-contributory pension purposes includes rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent, it should be noted that the actual effective assessment rates are much lower. For example, a couple with capital of £20,000 would only be assessed with means of £600, giving an effective assessment rate of just 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, I have already indicated to the House that my Department is reviewing the current method of assessing capital which was introduced by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>As part of this review, a recent sample survey was carried out to identify the amounts of capital held by old age pensioners. This survey indicates that of the 35,000 pensioners who have capital, approximately 24,600, 70 per cent have less than £5,000, while some 31,000, 88 per cent have less than £10,000. Only about 4 per cent of pensioners surveyed had capital in excess of £20,000.</P>
      <P>In the light of the survey findings, my Department is currently examining options for improving the method of assessing capital. However, in addition to benefiting those already in receipt of old age non-contributory pensions, any reduction of the current assessment rates would also be of benefit to pensioners with substantial amounts of capital and who are not currently entitled to payment.</P>
      <P>I would be anxious, therefore, to ensure that any possible changes to the current rules would benefit those with modest amounts of capital, while the system should continue to ensure that the small proportion of people with large amounts of capital should avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>
      <P>As any relaxation of the current rules would have financial implications, such a change could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>A widow or widower with dependent children and who does not have an entitlement to a widow's or widower's contributory pension should apply for one-parent family payment, rather than widow's or widower's non-contributory pension and will have access to community employment through that route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> In the case of a person without dependent children and in receipt of widow's or widower's non-contributory pension, they will relinquish entitlement to the pension payment for the duration of their participation on a community employment scheme. The community employment allowance will, in effect, be paid in lieu of their pension entitlement.</P>

      <P>My Department has received applications from two groups in Youghal seeking core funding. Youghal and district community development project applied for funding for both staff and running costs of a resource centre. The other group have also applied for funding towards the cost of employing a full-time co-ordinator and for management support for their resource centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both applications were examined by the CDP technical group, which was established to advise me on applications for community development funding and on areas to be prioritised for pro-active development of new projects. The technical group recommended the establishment of a project under the community development programme to serve the town of Youghal and its hinterland. In its recommendation, the technical group recommended that funding should not be allocated to either of the existing applicant groups, but that the new CDP project should be established in such a way that it draws on and involves members of both applicant groups and <Col N="1431" /> of any other relevant groups and interests in the area. I accepted this recommendation as being in the best interests of community development in the area.</P>
    <P>In this regard, both applications received were referred to Cork Community Development Institute which is the regional support agency for the programme in the southern region, and which has responsibility for setting up the new project in Youghal.</P>
    <P>CCDI have commenced the necessary preparatory work in the Youghal area. This involves working with all relevant local voluntary and community groups including the two applicant groups in order to bring the new project to the stage of signing a formal contract with the Department. The precise location of the project's office and the employment of staff are issues to be decided by the management committee of the new project, once it has been brought together by the regional support agency and is up and running.</P>
    <P>The provision of funding to Youghal and district community development project would pre-empt the outcome of the work currently being undertaken by CCDI.</P>

      <P>The objective in the State acquiring lands at Lucan Demesne was to establish a Liffey Valley park which would be co-operatively managed and maintained by the three local authorities concerned &ndash; Fingal, Kildare and South County Dublin &ndash; on the basis of an agreed management plan. A revised draft management plan was agreed by the local authorities and approved by my Department in early December 1998. South County Dublin has already executed the legal transfer documents.</P>
      <P>In response to a request from Kildare County Council agreement has been reached on an amendment to the contract documents transferring ownership of part of the demesne to that local authority. Completion of the legal formalities in this regard is currently in train. While Fingal County Council has had legitimate concerns about entering into a contract for that part of the demesne in Fingal, I understand that these concerns have now been addressed and that the way is clear for Fingal also to complete the legal formalities.</P>
      <P>Once the legal formalities have been attended to, it is then the responsibility of the three local authorities concerned to establish, manage and maintain the Liffey Valley park thereafter, and to agree on an opening date for public access to the park.</P>
      <P>I should stress that the contract documents and management plan are designed to protect the interests of all parties involved and also to provide the flexibility for the development of a co-ordinated management strategy for the Liffey Valley Park for the benefit of the local community and the public at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the comment that my Department is grossly underfunding the prison medical services. A full range of medical services are provided to all prisoners by one or more part-time doctors in each prison. In <Col N="1435" /> addition psychiatric services are provided when required. My Department is in the process of finalising a service with the Eastern Health Board to improve the organisation and level of psychiatric input in prisons in the Dublin area. We would envisage extending this arrangement, where feasible, with other health providers. All prisoners have access to appropriate dental services either provided in house by visiting dentists or by external local arrangements.</P>
      <P>I do accept that there is room for improvement in some areas. The director of the prison medical service, in his annual report for 1998 recommended an independent review of the structure and organisation of prison health care services. I had no hesitation in accepting his recommendation and I recently announced the establishment of a multi disciplinary group to conduct this review.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the review group will include the following: to consider and make recommendations regarding the structure and organisation of primary medical and nursing services within the prison environment in the light of the development of health care services generally and the needs of the prison population; to consider and make recommendations regarding the provision of psychiatric services to prisoners &ndash; taking into account changes in service provision generally and the potential ramification of possible new mental health legislation; to consider the appropriate need and level of in-house provision of specialist medical services and make recommendations accordingly; to consider structures for the legal and professionally appropriate control of pharmaceutical products within the prison system; to consider the present organisation of prison dental services and make any appropriate recommendations; and to consult with all relevant professional and representative bodies in this connection.</P>
      <P>The group will invite submissions from the general public as well as from special interest groups in relation to its review.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the 1998 annual report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals that the training of gardaí should encompass a mental health module in each divisional area due to the fact that the lack of Garda involvement in certain areas of mental health has caused many practical problems in ensuring that some mentally ill persons in the community receive appropriate hospital treatment.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the 1998 report of the inspector of mental hospitals was published recently. The Department of Health and Children will have a co-ordinating function in relation to implementation of the recommendations in the report and I understand that it will be initiating a consultative process with the relevant Departments and agencies in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities refute any suggestion of a lack of appropriate co-operation or involvement with mental health professionals. The Garda Síochána operates a front-line service in dealing with mentally ill members of society who find themselves in difficulty. As a 24 hour service, the Garda Síochána has a depth of experience in dealing with the mentally ill in a sensitive and compassionate manner. In the day to day course <Col N="1438" /> of their work they establish relationships with voluntary and statutory workers and services in the mental health area.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that all student-probationer gardai receive comprehensive training in relation to relevant aspects of mental health, including Garda powers under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, abnormal behaviours, for example, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and suicide.</P>
    <P>The social studies element of the training programme includes seminars facilitated by the Rape Crisis Centre, Women's Aid, the ISPCC, Aisdire and Victim Support. All of these seminars deal with the mental effects of the particular incident on the victim involved. Mental health issues relating to suicide and suicide prevention are being addressed by the Garda as part of a multi-agency approach towards a national suicide prevention policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the co-ordination of mental health responsibilities at divisional level, personnel in divisional in-service training schools provide advice to operational Garda on issues relevant to mental health and escort of patients, as the need arises.</P>
    <P>Community gardaí are required to liaise with all voluntary and statutory agencies and provide an identifiable contact for any potential or actual difficulties with the mentally ill in their own community.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are committed to keeping the present arrangements under ongoing review and, updating procedures as necessary in accordance with best practice.</P>

      <P>The plans, which address all critical business functions of the Department and its agencies were prepared over the summer period and were subjected to review by the internal audit unit of the Department.

      <P>My Department has formulated contingency and staff cover plans for the millennium changeover period, as required by Government, and has provided the interdepartmental monitoring committee for the year 2000 with an independently reviewed report on these plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, CERT and ADM Ltd. are participants on my Department's year 2000 monitoring committee, which was formed late last year to monitor and discuss achievement of year 2000 compliance and related issues. These agencies have formulated their own contingency and staff cover plans. The Irish Sports Council, which was formally established in July of this year, has yet to develop a computerised network within its office. It is, however, taking care to ensure that any IT or office equipment being procured is fully compliant and will be taking all measures available to ensure that its business critical functions <Col N="1441" /> can be maintained in the event of any possible Y2K failure.</P>

      <P>I understand that the document referred to by the Deputy is the one recently prepared for Bord Fáilte by Fitzpatrick Associates as part of a review of the regional tourism authorities. These authorities &ndash; RTAs &ndash; were established by Bord Fáilte, under the Tourist Traffic Acts, for the promotion and development of tourism on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>The objective is to review the role and operations of the RTAs and recommend how they can optimally contribute to the achievement of national tourism objectives and targets set by the Government in line with Bord Fáilte's strategic plan, while taking into account regional priorities and customer focus.</P>
      <P>The chairman of Bord Fáilte has forwarded to me a copy of their consultant's report together with the board's own views, for my consideration. This consideration will also take into account the implications, or the RTAs, of the tourism provisions in the recently published national development plan, and proposals for new all-island institutional structures for international tourism marketing under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>The work commissioned by Bord Fáilte from the consultants forms a review process which is ongoing and now nearing completion. The issue of the wider circulation of their consultant's document would of course be a matter in the first instance for Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 372 and 373 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> My Department has not carried out any specific research which would indicate a higher than average incidence of symptoms of dyslexia among juvenile offenders. All juvenile offenders placed in the custodial facilities operated under my Department undergo detailed assessment of all aspects of their needs, including their educational needs. The educational programmes delivered in these facilities are very broadly based and take account of the wide range of needs and abilities of the children in question. Individualised education and care programmes are developed for each child and any special educational needs are addressed as part of these programmes. The educational progress of all children is monitored by my Department's inspectorate.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy in relation to the identification of children with specific learning disability, including dyslexia, is in line with the recommendations of the special education review committee which reported in 1993. The criteria involved include assessment by a psychologist on a standardised test of intelligence which places general intellectual ability within the average range or above; and performance in basic literacy skills in relation to objective criteria using standardised tests.</P>
    <P>It would generally be expected that not more than 2 per cent of the overall pupil population would be found in this category.</P>
    <P>While it is generally recognised that many children involved in juvenile delinquency and coming to the attention of the courts are found to have very low levels of educational attainment, the particular research to which the Deputy refers has not come to the attention of my Department. However, inquiries will be made into the matter.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the payment of maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme are a matter for the local authorities, which are statutorily entrusted with the administration of the scheme under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968. My Department has been in contact with the local authorities and I understand that all local authorities had paid their first instalment on approved completed applications by 1 November.</P>
      <P>My Department has also been in contact with the vocational education committees who administer the VEC scholarships scheme and I understand all the vocational education committees had paid the first instalment on approved completed applications by mid November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European social fund-aided maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses provides for the payment of maintenance grants in monthly instalments in arrears by the relevant VEC. From enquiries made by my Department I understand that to-date all but one VEC has paid their first instalment on approved completed applications. In the case of the one VEC outstanding, I understand that the VEC in question notified the course co-<Col N="1445" /> ordinators, that due to IT difficulties they would not be in a position to pay until early December.</P>
    <P>The cases where first instalment payments have yet to be made are those where the local authorities-vocational education committees are awaiting further information from applicants or where late applications were accepted.</P>
    <P>In regard to the payment arrangements under the schemes of student support, the Deputy will be aware that officials of my Department are currently participating in a joint working group with officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs which is undertaking a detailed review of the administration of the student support schemes. I have previously indicated that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties. A date for completion of the work has not been identified.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to arrange for an immediate first instalment to be paid prior to commencing the course as the administering bodies have to process completed application forms in order to determine a candidate's eligibility and have to be satisfied that students are enrolled on approved courses before payment can be made.</P>

      <P>I have received the correspondence in question and a reply has now issued. The correspondence related to the admission of one of the correspondent's daughters to third level courses in Ireland, the lack of opportunities, at postgraduate level, for her second daughter and the availability of financial assistance for a third daughter in respect of her attendance at a course in the University of Glamorgan in Wales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> The position in relation to the admission of individual students to university courses, whether at undergraduate or postgraduate level, is that it is a matter for each individual university in accordance with the provisions of the Universities Act, 1997. My Department does not have any function in relation to the day to day operational affairs of such institutions and it would not be open to me, therefore, to intervene on behalf of any individual applicant.</P>
    <P>With regard to the availability of financial assistance for students studying abroad the position is that, as the Deputy may be aware, since 1996-97 the student support schemes have been extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students following approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in another EU member state. The University of Glamorgan, Wales is an approved college for the purpose of the higher education grant scheme. Eligibility for maintenance grants under the student support schemes is subject to a means test and application should be made to the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>Since 1998-99 the UK authorities have introduced an annual tuition fee for students entering further and higher education institutions for the first time. However, all EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fee subject to the same conditions as apply to UK students. This means that students from lower income families will receive full grant assistance towards the cost of their tuition fees.</P>
    <P>Finally, the 1999 Finance Act provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid (up to a maximum of £2,500) in respect of approved full-time third level courses pursued in a university or similar institution of higher education in another EU member state, which is maintained by recurrent grants from public funds in other EU member states. Approved courses are full-time undergraduate courses which are a minimum of two years duration other than courses in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or teacher training, including courses leading to the award of Bachelor of Education. Contact should be made with the local tax office in order to have one's eligibility for tax relief assessed.</P>

The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that with effect from January next, all primary schools with 100 or more pupils will be eligible for a grant of £30 per pupil towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme. My officials will be writing to all qualifying schools over the next couple of months confirming their inclusion, and setting out the details of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for secretarial and caretaking services.</P>

      <P>On 14 January 1998, I met with a deputation representing the parents of pupils at the school, whose objective was to retain Stella Maris as a voluntary secondary school. I indicated that, if the deputation were in a position to secure rental of the school premises and establish the necessary management structures for the continuation of the school, I would review the matter immediately. The deputation has not made any contact with the planning section of my Department since.</P>
      <P>In line with the trustees' decision of October 1997, the school did not enrol first year pupils last September and will close at the end of the 1999/2000 school year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware a school requires a staffing of principal and eight mainstream class teachers before the principal can be designated as an administrative principal.</P>
      <P>The staffing of primary schools is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between this Department and the education partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authorised staffing of Scoil an Athair Tadgh for the 1999-2000 school year is a principal <Col N="1450" /> and seven mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 222 pupils on 30 September 1998.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of the school on 30 September 1999 was 229 pupils which warrants a staffing of principal and eight assistants for the 2000-2001 school year. Subject to verification of the enrolment on 30 September 1999 the appointment of an administrative principal will be sanctioned for the 2000-2001 school year.</P>

      <P>The Universities Act, 1997 requires each university to prepare a statement of its equality policy addressing, <i>inter alia</i>, access of people who have a disability. Furthermore, the Higher Education Authority has, since 1996, provided targeted funding to the university sector for initiatives designed to promote access to, and participation in, higher education for students with disabilities. In 1999 this funding amounted to £539,000. Examples of initiatives funded to date, of particular relevance to deaf and hearing impaired students, include installation of loop systems, assistive technologies, counselling and other student support services, special alarm systems and staff training and awareness development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> In addition, the special fund for students with disabilities has operated since 1994 under the aegis of my Department to provide funding to students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions and, since 1998, post leaving certificate centres. The purpose of the special fund is to provide students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. In 1998 almost £100,000 was allocated to approximately 40 students with hearing impairments. The level of funding allocated to the special fund has increased substantially each year from £80,000 in 1994 to £250,000 in 1998. The arrangements for the 1999 special fund for students with disabilities are currently being finalised and I expect to make an announcement in this regard in the near future.</P>
    <P>Finally the Higher Education Authority is examining a proposal from Trinity College Dublin to establish a centre for deaf studies. The authority is consulting with various interests in the field in relation to the proposal and I understand that it expects to have this consultative process completed early in the new year. I further understand that the question of the availability of sign language interpreters will be considered in this regard.</P>

      <P>The allocation to an individual school in respect of remedial is determined by the enrolment in the school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 394 and 395 together.</P>
      <P>The clinic to which the Deputy refers is one of a number private commercial undertakings providing a tuition service for children of primary and post-primary age.</P>
      <P>Resources which become available to my Department to address special educational needs, including dyslexia, are targeted on the development of in-school support services which can be availed of by all children in the system who have a genuine need for such support.</P>
      <P>It would generally be expected that not more than 2 per cent of the overall pupil population would be found to be in the dyslexic category.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that equality of education is not presently available for children with specific learning disabilities, including dyslexia. The needs of such children are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance where necessary, of the remedial teacher service. Since the commencement of the current school year, the remedial teacher service has been extended to every first and second level school in the country.</P>
      <P>All fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability, including dyslexia, are normally integrated into ordinary classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the condition is of a more serious nature, such children may attend their local primary school where they can be supported by the special resource teacher service. In this connection, I would point out that arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with special educational needs within the primary system, including children with dyslexia, now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their <Col N="1454" /> needs. Indeed, since this decision was taken, an additional 183 resource teachers and 461 child care assistants have been allocated to the primary system to support children with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>For some children, the severity of the condition can be such that placement in a special school or in a special class attached to an ordinary school may be the required response. There are four such schools in operation at present.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides grants to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment to assist children with special needs, including those with dyslexia.</P>
    <P>In the current year, my Department has allocated £14,000 to CHILD, the Limerick based organisation established to provide care and help for individuals with learning difficulties. My Department has also allocated £50,000 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education and Science it is my intention to continue to focus available resources on developing in-school support services for children with special needs. I am satisfied that the range of special support services provided by my Department constitute a very significant response to the needs of students with specific learning disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 406 and 413 together.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I have been faced with requests that funding be made available for the appointment of escorts on special school transport services. From the outset, I have accepted the valid concerns expressed by parents and schools at the dangers to which special needs children can be exposed when travelling unaccompanied on these services.</P>
      <P>In an effort to address this issue, I secured an allocation of £3.4 million to fund the extension of the escort scheme to all 585 special transport routes in the country. This allocation was additional to the £150,000 already spent annually on the pilot escort scheme which has been in place on 34 transport routes for some years.</P>
      <P>I also took the view, which I still hold, that the most appropriate people to operate the escort scheme are the school authorities which are catering for the children in question on a daily basis and know the children's' needs and behaviours. This would be in line with the pilot project.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that I appreciate the extra work involved for schools in participating in this scheme. I also recognise the concerns and reservations which some individual schools have expressed at taking on responsibility for the escort scheme. While I appreciate that these concerns are validly held, I would point out that the pilot escort service which has operated for a number of years has not presented the difficulties which are now being raised by some schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am somewhat disappointed at the inflexible stance which certain schools appear to be adopting in relation to this matter, I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the com<Col N="1460" /> mitment shown by those school which have already gone ahead and appointed their escorts.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are in discussion with representatives of the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education in an effort to overcome reservations which have been expressed by certain schools at taking on responsibility for the escort scheme.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will make every effort to facilitate a resolution of this matter so as to ensure that escorts are appointed on all special transport services as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the position in relation to the adherence by school buses to the maximum number of passengers allowed; if insurance is valid when the bus is overcrowded; the type of insurance cover used in view of the increased possibility of accidents resulting from overcrowding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The loading on all school buses is determined by the relevant sections of the Road Traffic Regulations (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) which are laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Under public service vehicle regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio of three pupils for every two adult seats. Great care is taken to ensure that loadings do not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity of the different bus types in use. Bus Éireann complies with these regulations and all other relevant safety legislation.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann carries its own insurance, and all Bus Éireann vehicles operating under the school transport scheme are covered. In the case of contractors' vehicles, it is a legal requirement, and also a condition of contract, that such vehicles carry current motor insurance at all times when operating under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that all pupils carried under the school transport scheme, whether on Bus Éireann or contractors' vehicles, are covered by insurance whilst travelling.</P>

      <P>Voluntary secondary schools receive financial assistance towards their running costs under the terms of free education scheme. The Department meets the cost of teacher salaries <Col N="1461" /> and allowances and makes an annual <i>per capita </i>grant towards the recurrent costs of these schools. In addition, these schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants available under the scheme including grants for the employment of caretakers and secretaries and curricular support.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, I have increased funding to the voluntary secondary school sector significantly since 1997. This year the standard <i>per capita </i>grant was increased by £7 with a further increase of £8 planned from September next year. The level of secretarial grants has also been increased in the period. Schools generally have benefited from the IT 2000 initiative and the library books grant. Schools have welcomed these improvements.</P>
      <P>I am committed to improving further the funding position of voluntary secondary schools in the context of forthcoming budgets and in light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The purpose of section 24 of the Education (Welfare) Bill is to ensure that before a student can be expelled from a school a process is put in place which in the first instance can resolve whatever difficulties led to the proposed expulsion and in the second instance to ensure that at least a minimum education is provided for children of compulsory school-going age who are expelled from school. From a constitutional perspective the duty to ensure this falls on the State. In practice, the State can employ a range of measures to carry out its responsibility in this matter ranging from assisting a child and his or her parents to find an alternative school or in exceptional cases providing for home tuition. The particular solution adopted will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. The presence of an educational welfare officer as provided <Col N="1462" /> for in the Bill will greatly facilitate a successful outcome.</P>
      <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that I am considering amendments to this section in the context of the Committee Stage of the Bill with a view to providing further safeguards for students threatened with expulsion while at the same time acknowledging the interests of the schools and other students.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that schools require flexibility in relation to the utilisation of teaching resources so as to best meet the requirements of their students and the changing curricular needs in their schools. The use of a proportion of the approved teacher allocation in the employment of temporary and part-time teachers allows for such flexibility.</P>
      <P>Certain staff changes are unavoidable. However, I accept that it is in the best interests of pupils that staff changes are kept to a minimum particularly during the course of an academic year.</P>
      <P>It is a matter in the first instance for the authorities of the school concerned to decide whether a particular post should be filled in a permanent, temporary, eligible part-time or part-time capacity. In arriving at their decision, the school authorities must have regard to the needs of the school, the reason for the vacancy and any limits that apply in relation to the number of permanent staff employed.</P>

      <P>Inquiries have been made with Trinity College Dublin and I understand that the average pass rate for first year engineering for the last ten years is 90% and that the average pass rate for first year of the degree in information and communications technology, which has been running for two years, is 79 per cent. There was a 100 per cent pass rate on the second year of this degree course. I further understand that the college monitors the progress of students and offers additional tuition and support to students experiencing difficulties.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the challenge of maximising success rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for the individual University.</P>
      <P>On the issue of completion rates generally, the Higher Education Authority has commissioned the Educational Research Centre at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra to conduct a study of completion rates in the seven universities. Work is at an advanced stage and a final report which will include details of completion rates by field of study will be available after Christmas.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the facility CMIS pupil administration software package used by post-primary schools for general administration purposes and to generate certain statistical returns required by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding is provided by my Department under the school administration project to assist post-primary schools in acquiring information technology equipment and software for admin<Col N="1464" /> istration purposes. At least £500,000 has been provided under this project every year since 1992. In the school year 1998-99, 700 post-primary schools were provided with grants of up to £1,600 each to assist with the purchase of this new package and, where appropriate, the purchase of the necessary hardware to run it. In addition, most post-primary schools received a grant of £325 each towards associated running costs such as support charges and training.</P>
    <P>Last week I announced a new programme of expenditure over the next three years to support the use of information and communication technologies in schools. I also announced details of the final round of allocations under the existing Schools IT 2000 programme, including approximately £1 million for computerised administration in second-level schools. This funding is due to issue to schools shortly and includes an equipment grant to issue to all second-level schools of £2 per student enrolled subject to a minimum grant of £500 per school, and a grant of £350 for every second level school towards support and other running costs related to computerised school administration.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this expenditure makes a very significant contribution towards the cost to schools of computerised school administration. Costs associated with the purchase of computer equipment for administration may, at the discretion of schools, also be funded from their per capita or other general grants for running costs.</P>

The way in which this provision is made reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for primary and second level schools and is consistent with the manner in which financial allocations are made to each type of school. The levels of provision are reviewed each year in the budgetary context and in light of available resources.</P>

      <P>My Department has also been reporting to Government on a regular basis on the progress towards year 2000 compliance of bodies under its aegis. As part of my Department's monitoring role, the bodies have been informed of the need to develop contingency plans on a number of occasions throughout the last year. I met with the bodies earlier this month and again stressed the need for them to have adequate contingency arrangements in place. I also received assurances from the bodies that year 2000 issues would not affect the smooth running of any of the organisations during or after the Millennium changeover.</P>

      <P>To date, my Department has received approximately 53 applications for grant-aid towards the provision of dust extract systems. However, I should point out to the Deputy that, historically, my Department provided a central dust extract system in woodwork rooms in second-level schools. In recent times, concerns have been raised regarding the effectiveness of these dust extract systems.</P>
      <P>In response to these concerns, a working group was set up within my Department to examine this issue. The working group has concluded that four of the officially sanctioned items of equipment used in woodwork rooms require dust extract systems.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the working group consider that the most appropriate mechanism to redress the problem of dust revolves around updating the particular items of equipment so that each of these machines has its own integral dust extract system.</P>
      <P>In advance of formally recommending this approach, the working group advise that it is necessary to pilot the new equipment. Officials in my Department are currently selecting schools for participation in the pilot scheme.</P>
