      <P>Before proceeding further, I would like to take the opportunity to welcome to Dáil Éireann a parliamentary delegation from the Isle of Man who are here with us this morning in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. On my own behalf, and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann, I extend to you a most sincere welcome to our country. I express the hope that you will find your visit to Ireland interesting, successful and to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. a12, motion re Oral Questions and Priority Questions; No. 1, Údarás na Gaeltachta (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, 1999 [Seanad], Second Stage (resumed); No. 2, Education (Welfare) Bill, 1999 [Seanad], Second Stage. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders or the Order of the Dáil of 29 September, that No. a12 shall be taken before Private Members' Business and shall be decided without debate.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, asked the Tánaiste if she would consider and agree to send the Ansbacher report to the Garda Commissioner. In the Dáil last night, the Tánaiste said she would consider that. The Taoiseach is aware that the newspapers, which have a job to do, are busily staking out and looking for more names. Before there is another frenzy of leaking this weekend, will the Taoiseach tell us that the Tánaiste has agreed to give the report to the Garda Commissioner so that we can ascertain whether, in fact, a leak has occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the House that this matter is not appropriate to the Order of Business. I have allowed the Deputy to make a brief comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a procedural point. We will not be sitting after today and the Tánaiste said she would give it consideration overnight. I want to know if the Government has agreed to give the report to the commissioner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach wish to comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, the Tánaiste did say yesterday that she would consider that matter and she is doing that. She has not made a decision yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that this needs to be done extremely quickly before more names are put into the public arena and more reputations hurt&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot pursue the matter any further at this stage. There will be an opportunity for the Deputy to have the matter pursued later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that perhaps it is in keeping with what the Tánaiste said that if the names of people who are guilty are put into the public arena they will have the advantage of their prosecutions failing and the Government will be complicit in that if it does not ensure that no more leaking occurs? Will the Taoiseach tell us by the end of today's business that this report is going to the Garda Commissioner?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we were discussing the companies Bill the purpose of which is to reform and amend the Companies Act, 1990. I understand from the Whips' meeting last night that the <Col N="603" /> Government has indicated that it now intends to bring forward the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, the Government's Bill, which completed Committee Stage in July and which is now scheduled for Report Stage. Since this Bill would enable us to address the issue of the Ansbacher accounts by way of increasing and extending the number of competent authorities or competent persons, why will the Government not bring that Bill in at Report Stage as a matter of urgency instead of waiting until 18 October because the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, is not available? In view of the mechanism that is open to the Chair now, would he reconsider that parliamentary timetable and bring forward that Bill in respect of which there are only a few outstanding amendments that need to be addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, Order for Report Stage, a number of amendments are being prepared. The Department is not ready to bring those forward. As soon as they are, we will bring the Bill to the House, but that will take a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That Bill was in the House on 21 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, we are trying to be helpful in relation to a matter that has convulsed the entire country. The Government has the remedy in its own hands. The suggestion that three, four, five, or even ten amendments are of such a scale of complexity that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment cannot draft them is simply laughable. The idea that we have to wait until 18 October to deal with this before it goes to the Seanad displays no sense of urgency on the part of the Government. I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider. If necessary we will draft the amendments for the Department if they are stuck &ndash; we have done it before. The reality is that this matter needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us has to do with non-resident companies. I do not think it has to do with what Deputy Quinn is talking about. That legislation will be drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is misinformed. On the Committee Stage of this Bill, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, through the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, submitted a major amendment at the last minute amending section 21 of the 1990 Act, extending from five to 12 the competent authorities.  I have gone through the Committee Stage of the Bill and, although the Minister said here and there that he would return on Report Stage on a number of issues, at no stage did he actually say he would table amendments. I do not understand why the Department has had two and a half <Col N="604" /> months to examine this and why they cannot now expedite their work and bring it back. Legislation has been introduced overnight before. Deputy Rabbitte and I tabled many amendments and I would be happy for the Minister to take them on board. They have been drafted for the Minister by the two Opposition spokespersons.</P>

        <b>:</b> Ó scoir an Dáil leag an Chúirt Uachtarach ar lár cuid thábhachtach den Acht a chruthaigh páirc náisiúnta stairiúil sa Bhlascaod Mór. An bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas leasú a dhéanamh ar Acht 1989 chun gur féidir dul ar aghaidh leis an bpáirc stairiúil seo?</P>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach on a number of occasions during the last session about the Government's intention regarding the Great Blasket island and the difficulties when the High Court struck down part of the 1989 historic park Act. He indicated that the Government would await the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal. Unfortunately, since the Dáil went into recess the Supreme Court has struck down part of the Act making possible the creation of a national park in the Blasket islands. Is it the Government's intention to bring in amending legislation, so that this cultural treasure can be protected and a national historical park can be created on the Great Blasket? Will the Taoiseach bring forward legislation this session?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is promised legislation. The Department is considering the Supreme Court judgment in regard to the National Parks and Historic Properties Bill. I do not have a date for it because the judgment is being considered. However, I will try to get a date for the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the previous issue of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, I raised this matter at the Whips' meeting last night. Let us be frank and honest about this. The Department is supposed not to have amendments ready but the real reason is that the Minister of State is supposed to be in Washington for the next two weeks. I have requested that this matter be dealt with by another Minister next week. The business for next week has not been agreed because it is subject to this Bill being taken next Wednesday.</P>

      <P>In relation to the information given on the National Parks and Historic Properties Bill by the Taoiseach a few moments ago, that Bill is described in the list of forthcoming legislation as one on which work in not proceeding due to other priorities. The Taoiseach may want to correct the record. There is a way of answering Deputy Joe Higgins' question by, for example, incorporating Inishvickillaune in a national park, which may be considered delaying the Government.</P>
      <P>I want to ask about two pieces of legislation on list D, which is a list of legislation for which no heads are in existence at present. One is the promised legislation to allow for parent representation on vocational education committees. The Minister for Education and Science promised that legislation would be prepared without delay. The heads are not in existence so, obviously, he has not been electrified into providing democracy in vocational education.</P>
      <P>Neither the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands nor the Aire Stáit are here. However, that legislation is falling off the end of list D. It says that heads are being prepared for the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Bill. Baineann an reachtaíocht seo le botún a rinneadh sna seachtóidí. This legislation was to amend mistakes made in the 1970s in the allocation&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the <Col N="606" /> Government to produce this legislation rectifying mistakes made in the 1970s? Why are the heads of the legislation not ready, given that the Minister of State has been traipsing around the Gaeltacht giving an impression of energy?</P>

Late 1999 a bhí ar an liosta deiridh agus late 2000 atá ar an liosta seo. Má tá príorachtaí eile ag baint leis an National Parks and Historic Properties Bill, cad iad na príorachtaí sin?

      <P>Two minutes is a confined period in which to make a worthwhile contribution on this most important issue that has focused the attention of most of the nation. I wish simply to focus on one aspect of the facts put before the House last night by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn. On 13 January 1998, the Tánaiste appointed an authorised officer. On 28 January 1998, Deputy Quinn stated in the House &ldquo;I welcome the Tánaiste's investigation and I hope it bears fruit but we have no guarantee that the report of that investigation will be published&rdquo;. Throughout the intervening period we have sought, through Priority Questions in the name of my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, to have the names of those involved put in the public domain. The Tánaiste twice gave assurances in the House that that was her intention also, but, despite the fact that she gained much publicity at the end of 1998 when she received the report for exposing major corruption and a golden circle, we have still had nothing but a series of leaked names. We do not know whether they are on any list and it is incumbent on the Government to put an end to this farce, accede to this motion and allow the names to enter the public domain in a structured and orderly way.</P>
      <P>Last night in her contribution the Tánaiste mumbled that there had been interference throughout in the matter. It is vital that the Government &ndash; and, hopefully, the Tánaiste will do so at the conclusion of the debate &ndash; will indicate who sought to interfere with her and her inspectors in getting at the truth of this matter. She cannot glibly put a comment such as that on the record of the House without putting the full facts in the public domain. There is much to be found out in this matter. I look forward, I hope, to a majority at 12.30 p.m. when the vote is called agreeing the motion and allowing the will of the people to be vindicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. However, I agree with a number of Opposition Members and, indeed, the Tánaiste that there is tremendous public anger at what is being revealed in terms of the Ansbacher accounts, the <Col N="616" /> DIRT inquiry, etc.. Anybody who was involved in politics or who tried to eke out a living in the 1980s is well aware of what the economic climate was like then. I recall attending meetings regularly when the cutbacks in pupil-teacher ratios were announced due to lack of funding. At that time 40,000 to 50,000 young people emigrated annually, interest rates were at an all-time high and people were losing their homes. The people who are under investigation were defrauding the State at the same time and the money involved would have made life a little more bearable for those who lost their homes or the chance to reach their full potential because of cutbacks in the education system.</P>
      <P>The point at which I part company with the Opposition is that the public's anger is focused and it is not simply screaming for a list of names to be published. People who visited my clinic at the weekend and other politicians to whom I have spoken are saying they are angry but they want to get even and see this investigation and the DIRT inquiry result in the jailing of people. Sight was lost of that during this debate last night and I hope that does not happen today. I do not have any wisdom or knowledge in regard to this issue, but I listened carefully to the debate last night to try to understand why publishing 120 names would result in the public getting even. I am not convinced and I still do not understand how that would occur.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of the Fine Gael leader's contribution dealt with retrospective legislation. He said that the Opposition had proved the Government wrong after it said that it could not deal with this issue retrospectively and, therefore, he was right and the Government was not. One can concede that point and that it is wonderful, but I do not know if that would help in terms of this investigation. I totally accept people's anger in regard to selective leaking. This side of the House has suffered much from such activity in regard to other inquiries and issues. People found that they had to defend their positions because their names appeared in Sunday newspapers.</P>
      <P>However, I do not understand how listing 120 other people will vindicate those whose names were printed in <i>The Irish Times</i> during the week unless, of course, they do not appear on the list. If they appear, how does that vindicate them? How does it vindicate the people whom the Tánaiste indicated may not have a criminal case to answer? How does adding to the list of names in the public arena help those have not done any wrong? However, more importantly, the reason I oppose the motion is, as the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have indicated, that it would put in jeopardy the possibility of achieving the public's objective, which is to jail these cheats and confiscate their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand how anybody feels that naming and shaming will affect people who deliberately defrauded the State over a long period and dreamed up this scheme, which I still do not fully understand. What they did amounted to rob<Col N="617" /> bing money from the pockets of compliant taxpayers and then claiming a tax rebate on it. Does anybody believe that such people, who presumably do not even live in Ireland, will be shamed or dreadfully hurt as a result of the publication of their names in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> or <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>? It is ludicrous to suggest that.</P>
    <P>We will be found guilty unless we achieve the public's objective. Deputy Quinn mentioned that during the DIRT inquiry he asked the Revenue Commissioners why there were not any high profile, Lester Piggot-type jailings. Many people have said to me that it is very strange that tax evaders and white collar criminals have not been jailed. We can do that now. However, I believe absolutely and categorically that if the names are published, that will be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and, indeed, other members of Government have been accused of leaking the names. I do not know whether the leader of the Opposition read the Tánaiste's statement. However, the affidavit was sent to the High Court. I do not know that the High Court is renowned for being watertight. Every story printed in the <i>Phoenix</i> seems to emerge from what it describes as &ldquo;The Four Goldmines&rdquo;. It would not be impossible for information to emanate from that source. The affidavit was also sent to the six directors of Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd. and to the company's legal advisers.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Tánaiste asked who could benefit from these leaks and it is obvious who would. I do not like to suggest, as has been suggested, that Deputy Bruton tabled this motion and wanted this list to be put into the public domain so that these people would go scot-free. It would totally suit the people I have just mentioned if something were to go wrong and these people could not be pursued to the doors of Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>We have had numerous instances of tax loopholes. If we do what is required by or requested in this motion today we will not be creating a loophole, rather we will be knitting a quilt with substantial holes for this and future inquiries. The Tánaiste has made it very clear that future inquiries and the powers of inspectors in the future would be put in jeopardy if we were to do what is being requested in this motion.</P>
    <P>I have encountered criticism and anger among my constituents in regard to this matter but I have not encountered any criticism, good, bad or indifferent, of the manner in which the Tánaiste, her staff and the inspectors have dealt with this issue from start to finish. I have heard many complaints about other tribunals and the manner in which they are carrying out their work but I have not heard anybody complain about or criticise the manner in which the inspectorate, the Minister and her Department have gone about their work in the McCracken, Moriarty or Ansbacher investigations. As far as I am concerned, it has been faultless. We must ensure that it continues to be faultless and that we can bring these people to the courts. When criminal proceedings are <Col N="618" /> brought against these people, their names can and should be published at that point.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening, a former Fine Gael Minister for Finance admitted on radio that until now &ndash; not last year or the year before &ndash; under this Taoiseach, this Government and its Ministers, there was not the political will to go after tax evaders. That speaks volumes about what happened in the past for which everyone is perhaps culpable and liable. It also speaks volumes about what this Government intends to do in terms of pursuing tax evaders. For the Opposition to frustrate, or make more difficult, the possibility of securing convictions highlights precisely the comments made by the former Fine Gael Minister for Finance, namely, that the political will to tackle this issue did not exist until now. We now have the political will and ask the Opposition to support the Government in what it is attempting to do. We are witnessing the zeal of the convert but I would ask Opposition Members to keep it in check in order that we can jail those who shamefully defrauded the State of income due to it and made compliant taxpayers and families in the 1980s suffer in a manner they should not have had to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons I, as a Member of this side of the House and as a compliant taxpayer, would like to see those who have been involved in tax evasion, and criminal activity in this case, brought to justice quickly. There are many reasons I would like to see these people publicly named and shamed. I have been a PAYE taxpayer all my working life. Like all other PAYE taxpayers, I have not been in a position, even if I so desired, to take action to avoid paying my full and fair share of tax. Like other taxpayers, I had to meet the tax bill of the 1980s. As a compliant taxpayer, I believe that the tax cheats in this country should be forced to face the full rigours of the law. Some of those involved in this particular scam undoubtedly deserve custodial sentences on the basis of the information we have to date. A sense of justice for all taxpayers and an understandable desire for retribution is, therefore, the first reason I would like to see the names in public. However, vengeance is not always the best reason for taking a particular course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second reason which I would advance for the publication of the names and it relates to the political connections of these high profile business people. All of the evidence to date suggests that the tax cheats in question come from a particular part of the business elite of this State. Moreover, I believe they come from a part of the business elite that one is much more likely to find gracing meetings of the Opposition party than a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis. That may be hurt<Col N="619" /> ful but if the boot were on the other foot, Members of the Opposition would sink it in deep.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may digress on this point, every conceivable Fianna Fáil connection with those who were involved in any part of this scandal is rightly and properly explored in the newspapers and on the airwaves. It is interesting, to take just one example, that the political pedigree of a former bank chairman &ndash; a bank which, more than most businesses in this country, appears in the headlines in connection with every scandal in the State &ndash; is somehow avoided in all political reportage. However, political spite or personal vendettas do not constitute good reasons for publishing the names at this particular time.</P>
      <P>The political temptation to grab any immediate headlines in this case should be avoided. If we were to go the route proposed by the Opposition we would damage the ultimate opportunity to bring these people and others on the list to full justice. Neither political spite nor the righteous and understandable anger of compliant taxpayers is sufficient reason to suggest that we should cast aside the ideal of due process on this or any other occasion. Even tax cheats and fraudulent hypocrites are entitled, in a civilised state, to have their day in court. I hope that day comes sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>In addition to the general principles of due process, there are other important reasons which have, by and large, been ignored in much of the debate to date on this issue and which, in my view, explain why it is important not to succumb to the initial temptation to immediately name and shame those involved in this affair.</P>
      <P>First, there is the fact that the High Court appointed the three inspectors to investigate the report of Ansbacher Limited. I believe that the inspectorate should be allowed to get on with their job and complete their work as quickly as possible without any political or other interference. Second, there is the reality that disclosure of the names in question would, in all probability, be illegal. The leader of the Opposition charged the Tánaiste, who has been exemplary in every regard in this matter, with criminal irresponsibility because some names were leaked. He did not have a shred of evidence before he made a political charge against her; that is the reality of the way the Opposition behaves in all political debates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21(1) of the Companies Act specifically prohibits the disclosure or publication of information or of documents except to a competent authority unless such disclosure or publication is required for legal purposes which are set out in the Act. The Members on the <Col N="620" /> Opposition benches are well aware of that. Moreover, section 21(2) specifically makes it a criminal offence to make a disclosure or to cause material to be put into the public domain. In addition to the fact that it would be wrong in every sense to set aside due process, as the Opposition and Deputy Bruton, in particular, are demanding, it would be a criminal offence to do so under the existing law of this State.</P>
      <P>The actions of Fine Gael and the leadership of that party represent cynicism of the highest order in my view.</P>

      <P>Another aspect of Deputy Bruton's behaviour in this case is difficult to understand. Not so long ago he was an advocate of institutional reform, particularly of Dáil reform. In a very worthwhile document which he published he gave us all good advice as to how we should avoid falling into political traps in political debate yet, time and again, Deputy Bruton fails to follow his own good advice in this regard. This is one of those occasions where he is crassly guilty of ignoring the advice he has offered the rest of us. In addition to ignoring the law, the Opposition is also proposing retrospective change in legislation in this case. The arguments against retrospective legislation in this and virtually every other case have been well rehearsed and I do not wish, therefore, to go over them again. Retrospective legislation, in a case where people may face very serious criminal charges, is a perilous course of action.</P>

      <P>Over the last ten or 15 years, Dáil Éireann has, time and again, allowed events outside this House to determine the manner in which we operate. As a result, the Dáil has failed on many occasions to follow through on major issues. Instead of fulfilling its responsibilities the Dáil has set them aside in order to become embroiled in headline grabbing. This is one of those occasions. I give one example which is germane to this debate and to the excellent work being done currently by the Committee of Public Accounts. I refer to the sale of land to Roadstone at Glending. We debated this issue on four occasions here and in the other House. On each occasion there was a good deal of political hand wringing and a considerable amount of concern was put on the public record. Sadly, that is as far as it went &ndash; politicians postured and played to the gallery but they failed to take effective action. The failure of Dáil Éireann in that case is evidenced by the fact that nine months later and after the production of an excellent report by the Committee of Public Accounts the Dáil has not debated the report.</P>

      <P>It is the duty of this legislature to uphold the Constitution and it is our duty to uphold the rule of law. There are times when that might not be the expedient thing to do but there are never times when it is the wrong thing to do. The Constitution states that we have a duty to protect and vindicate the good name of every citizen. The Article states, &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen&rdquo;. It is the job of the Legislature to protect those people and their good names. Every person is entitled to his good name until he is deprived of it by due process of law. All we are asking is that due process of law be carried out in this event. We cannot deny that due process.</P>
      <P>It has already been stated that the law specifically prevents the publication of the list of names. The Companies Act and the High Court order state that it cannot be published. Indeed, the motion put down by the Opposition acknowledges this. We must ask why this law was enacted &ndash; it was passed only in this decade. It was enacted to ensure that, for example in this case, the authorised officer under the procedure of the 1990 Act, can permit a speedy and comparatively inexpensive examination of the affairs of a company. It is all very well to shout about tribunals but had this matter been sent to a tribunal two years ago it would now be buried so deep in procedure that we would never have got the results achieved to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authorised officer made his report but the powers given to him do not purport to include the investigation of individuals. He did not purport to make any findings in relation to individuals, only in relation to the company. The list of Ansbacher account holders &ndash; the 120 names &ndash; is just a list of names which came to his attention in the course of investigating a company. It is now, therefore, appropriate that those names should be investigated by the inspectors, an investigation which should be allowed to take place unhindered, and it is important that we take no steps <Col N="623" /> which might compromise or endanger any of the steps currently under way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot take a reckless gamble which would collapse the inspectorate or which would prejudice any possible criminal prosecution. Of course people are interested in the names. People want to know who has evaded tax but until we can prove that these people have done wrong and have committed a criminal offence, and due process has allowed them to defend their good names, the list of names should not be published. We cannot sacrifice the prospect of a prosecution to satisfy curiosity and we certainly cannot sacrifice constitutional rights simply because the public are interested.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court has stated that the right to a fair trial is superior to the right of the people to prosecute. I am not willing to take any risks, as other Members of this House and, indeed, leaders of parties did over the weekend. One Member referred to the names on the list as criminals and another said that the principle that a person is innocent until proved guilty does not apply in this case. That principle applies in every case and is at the basis of our judicial system and our democracy. Any pre-trial publicity could jeopardise the case, as we have seen happen in previous cases. Mr. Justice Flood, for example, refused to extradite a person to England on a murder charge because his name and photograph had appeared in the English papers and it was felt that he could not get a fair trial for that reason. The X case, by contrast, was allowed go ahead because, although there had been considerable publicity, the name had not been mentioned. The circumstances in that case, in terms of publicity, are similar to what we face here. It was also said by Mr. Justice Flood that what the public are interested in does not equate with the public interest. We should ensure that we are not taking a gamble with our justice system because I, as a PAYE worker speaking on behalf of many people who are annoyed by this, want to ensure that justice is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have spoken about retrospective legislation. Yes, laws have been changed but they have never been changed in circumstances where they would have a direct effect of affecting someone's good name or the direct intention to do so. They have never been changed in a way which might potentially prejudice criminal trials. Those are the matters we should consider in recommending that legislation be changed. I am determined, as a member of Fianna Fáil and as a Member of this House, to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution. I want to ensure that the Constitution is enforced equally for all persons. If we agree to the amendment before us, we will dash the hopes of many of the Ansbacher account holders who hope to evade justice. If we allow the system to proceed in the very efficient manner in <Col N="624" /> which it has been going, through the authorised officer and by the inspector, we can ensure that justice is done and that not only will our curiosity be satisfied but results will come at the end.</P>
    <P>The procedure which has been adopted is right. It gives due process and it upholds people's good names. I want to see answers. I want to see the Revenue investigating the matter. I want to see taxes, interest and penalties paid. I want to see the Garda investigating this matter and taking criminal prosecutions, if necessary. I want to see the Criminal Assets Bureau moving in with its extensive powers. A multi-agency approach is needed but that is all part of due process. Let us work in a calm, responsible manner, which will not jeopardise prosecution or the system but will ensure that justice is done. As they say, &ldquo;Let justice be done though the heavens may fall&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There are two main issues in this debate. The first is whether to publish the full list of Ansbacher names and the second is the responsibility for the selective leaking of some of those names to date. These issues are interlinked. The names were published by responsible journalists in <i>The Sunday Times</i>,<i> The Irish Times </i>and the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. They did not invent these names but got them from somewhere. They did not have the full list of names, so there was a selective leaking. Names were selected by somebody &ndash; some person or persons presently unknown &ndash; and given to these journalists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>To consider this more closely, some of the names arose from the reference to the affidavit to the CRH board and I will return to this point. They were identifiable. The other distinguishing feature of some of the names is that names were mentioned &ndash; household names &ndash; but it turned out subsequently that they could not have been involved in tax evasion of any kind because they were not resident and, therefore, not liable to any tax in the first place. Why were those names put into the public domain and by whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another distinguishing feature is that there are a certain number of prominent Fine Gael names. It was clear subsequently that they were entirely innocent and had no deposits. In fact, it appears that they had no information that they were on the list. Why were those names selectively leaked? I do not know the answer to that. I can only adduce that they were put into the public <Col N="625" /> domain as a shield or protection for the main list in the hope that the issue would be obscured and clouded and that when the main list is ultimately produced, as inevitably it will be, that they will be able to identify with those who, clearly, are innocent. That may be so, but I am not sure about that. It is clear that there was no due process or prior notification in respect of the names of those which have been selectively leaked.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hanafin talked about the protection of the Constitution and the vindication of people's good names, but there was no such consideration nor was there anybody to vindicate their good names.</P>
      <P>On the question of political responsibility, from a legal point of view, the Tánaiste has a case to answer. She authorised the inclusion of a reference to the board of CRH in the affidavit that went before the court. That took the cork off the bottle&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because this was a clearly identifiable, small group. Why was that identification included in the affidavit? It was entirely unnecessary. It took the cork off the bottle. The Tánaiste said, in her statement, that it was necessary to give a sample of evidence and it was the minimum legally required to support the appointment of the inspectors. I do not accept that. That was a mistake of judgment on her part. Having said that, the report was in her hands for a year and, I have to say, there were no leaks during that time. It is fair to put that on the record as well. I am trying to be fair, honest and reasonable with everybody.</P>
      <P>The other person who has a case to answer is the Taoiseach. It is clear from the Tánaiste's statement that a copy of the report was sent to the Taoiseach in July. What happened that report? With whom did the Taoiseach discuss it? Did anybody in his office take copies of it? Who saw that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it locked in the safe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a case to answer there. The Taoiseach should come to the House and explain exactly what became of that report in his office. The way to deal with this issue is that suggested by Deputy Bruton &ndash; the issue should be referred to the Garda Commissioner. I do not accept the response of the Tánaiste in this regard when she prevaricated to a degree that she might do it, she might take advice and might come to a decision. There is a clear case for referring this issue to the Garda Commissioner who could follow up the questions I have only touched on here. When doing that, she could also ask the Garda Commissioner to deal with what appears to have been an attempt to spike the investigation. She refers, in her statement, to the fact that there <Col N="626" /> were people who made several attempts to close down this matter during the past 18 months. That is an allegation of a criminal offence. That issue and those names should also be referred to the Garda Commissioner and I urge the Tánaiste to do that.</P>
      <P>The next main issue, coupled to that issue, is the question of full disclosure. It is now time to put in place a proper procedure for full disclosure. I was not in favour of selective leaking and I am not in favour of breaking the law. I am in favour of changing the law so that full disclosure can take place under circumstances which allow those who are on the list advance notification so they can vindicate their rights and are not put in the position of those whose names were selectively leaked. That is the way to do it. We have a ludicrous position that the names of those who are clearly innocent are in the public domain, yet those about whom there are major suspicions of guilt are hiding behind this cloak of secrecy. Why is the Government presiding over that approach? It is the wrong approach.</P>
      <P>While I would not favour publishing the report now because that would be in breach of section 21, I propose a simple amendment to section 21, which would facilitate the putting in place of a proper procedure whereby people could be notified, given an opportunity to prepare their defence, if they have one, and then the list could be published.</P>
      <P>There is so much public outrage over this issue that fingers of suspicion will be pointed, perhaps wrongly, at a Government that presides over the shielding and the cover up of this. The voice of Parliament should prevail. The reasoned debate here should be taken into account by the Government. Let us at this stage ensure that a fair and proper procedure is put in place rather than that which has taken place during the past few weeks. I do not think anybody on the Government side would say that what took place during the past week is a fair way to deal with the matter, yet the Government has presided over it and has attempted to justify closing the issue at this stage on the basis that it would be unfair to publish the full list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember reading <i>The Trial</i> by Kafka and what has happened, in many instances, in the past week has been Kafkaesque. People have been put on trial without any notification or knowledge of what they are being accused and that has been done in a manner which the Government has refused to have properly investigated. What we must do now, and quickly, is to put in place proper procedures. There is no case for suggesting, as mentioned by an earlier speaker, that one would be in breach of the Constitution by so doing. Article 15.5 of the Constitution merely states &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission&rdquo;. Clearly, we are not precluded by Article 15.5 from putting in place proper procedures. It is the right and proper thing to do and we should do it straight away so that <Col N="627" /> the full list of Ansbacher names can be put into the public domain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy McGahon.</P>
      <P>During the years the magician, Paul Daniels, provided great entertainment, he could make things disappear before one's eyes but he could not hold a candle to the late Des Traynor who apparently had the ability to make £1 million disappear before one's eyes only for it to reappear later whenever the donor asked for it back. It is amazing that the names of those who availed of the so-called skills of Des Traynor are on a list which has not been made public. The question honest and decent people are asking is why was it necessary to circulate 15 copies of this document, one of the most sensitive documents compiled since the foundation of the State and which contains 120 names? Let us suppose a serious crime is committed &ndash; a murder &ndash; and the Garda Síochána, for whom I have great respect, has its suspicions and prepares a file for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Can one imagine 15 copies being distributed to suspects so that they could cover their tracks? In this instance some of the 15 copies have been distributed to suspects.</P>
      <P>Why was it necessary to circulate four copies of the document to senior members of the Government &ndash; the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance &ndash; and the Attorney General, Mr. McDowell? Are the people concerned not on speaking terms? Why was one copy not placed in the Tánaiste's office for their perusal and safe keeping? Were any conditions attached? Were the people concerned allowed to bring the document home to their wives, girl friends or partners for their perusal? We do not know.</P>
      <P>What ordinary decent people cannot understand is why copies were sent to four directors of Ansbacher Bank. These are crooked people with a crooked bank. They were prepared to accept and find a home for this hot, stolen money. It is unbelievable, outrageous and unacceptable that they should receive copies of this very sensitive document. They are prepared to cover their tracks by any means possible, including leaks and the naming of names to try to muddy the waters.</P>
      <P>It is said regularly on &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; by the Garda Síochána that if people were not prepared to purchase stolen goods there would be fewer robberies. If the bank in question was not prepared to find a home for the money involved, the people concerned &ndash; pillars of society, big businessmen &ndash; would not have been able to participate in this unbelievable scam.</P>

      <P>On Monday the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> published a list of tax offenders who have offended this year. That being so, these fat cats who have money in offshore accounts must be exposed. While everybody is entitled to due process &ndash; I do not believe in lynching parties &ndash; when the investigation takes place the names of the people concerned must be published. They have been portrayed by Deputy Roche and the other lady as patriots with their money in another country but I point the finger at the political system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been known for many years that there is a form of corrupt banking. All Governments, lawyers and accountants turned a blind eye to the offshore facilities that were available &ndash; it was a nudge and a wink philosophy. The Pandora's box is now being opened revealing the awful corruption in Irish life, politics and the banking system. I demand that the names be published in the interests of the small people of Ireland who have to pay their taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned that people may be innocent. What innocent people have money in the Ansbacher accounts? There are no innocent people involved, just greedy people. There is a large element of greed in Irish society. The people concerned are not innocent. There were no innocents abroad. They had their money in offshore accounts because of greed &ndash; the biggest illness in Irish society. Following due process their names must be published. Stalling and bluster will not do Fianna Fail any good. It must stand up for the small people of Ireland, not the fat cats <Col N="629" /> who have their money abroad. They are greedy people, not patriots.</P>
    <P>We all knew what was happening. It is very easy to kick defenceless and grovelling bankers in the teeth. Why did the policital system not draw back the veil on what was happening? The Irish banking system is corrupt and many of those involved should have been removed by Government action for their actions against the people in recent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I support the motion. It is obvious that if the political will is there the names can be published. Previous speakers referred to the outrage and anger felt by ordinary people. This is slightly incorrect. Anger is an external emotion, it is expressed. People will not come to Leinster House and tear the gates down. There is however a deep sense of frustration. People are depressed and this despondency will be reflected in the polls at the next election when the turnout will be very low. The corrosive effects of scandal after scandal on the political system are incalculable.</P>
      <P>As elected representatives, we must address that problem.</P>
      <P>It has also been said that those who are guilty are quaking in their boots. I do not believe that either. There is a certain mild embarrassment but, as they go to the Horseshoe Bar or Patrick Guilbaud's and sip their vintage wines, they do not appear embarrassed. It is part of the whole state of play for these elite circles &ndash; something they did at the time. It seems that everyone in those wealthy circles was at it, and evading tax was not seen as evading one's civic responsibility. That is how I, the Green Party and many Deputies see the situation. Paying tax is part of one's duty as a citizen and a member of society. However, these people do not believe in society but go along with the Thatcherite dictum that there is no such thing as society, there are only individuals. I hope that, through this process, we will punish the Thatcherites. We must punish them and they must be seen to be punished. Deputy Roche said that this demands a custodial sentence. However, more than that, the real punishment demands that their wealth be taken from them. They survive on and have influence through their wealth &ndash; that is how the golden circle operates.</P>
      <P>There is a perception that the golden circle cannot operate without political influence. So much is thrown at our door because political parties receive donations from companies like CRH and AIB. It is time for corporate donations to cease because there must be a separation between big business and the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Roche that CRH must be investigated. However, regrettably, the appointment of Justice Moriarty meant that this was precluded from the investigation. We must investigate how this came about. My colleague, Patricia McKenna MEP, asked the former Attorney General, David Byrne, if he ever had shares in CRH. He replied: &ldquo;I don't have shares in CRH&rdquo;. The <Col N="630" /> Public Accounts Committee report must be debated in the House. We must have a full investigation. I would like to refer to the disgraceful tax amnesty but I do not have sufficient time to go into that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>On my behalf and on behalf of Sinn Féin I wish to put of the record that I support the motion. In doing so I am conscious of the need to do nothing to jeopardise the possibility of prosecutions. In the past few days we have been subjected to a barrage of conflicting legal opinion on this matter. On balance, I feel the course set down in this motion is a viable one. It is also consistent with the stand I took in the House two years ago when some of us on the Opposition benches urged that the Ansbacher issue be included in the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal. Interestingly, Fine Gael, the proposer of this motion, abstained on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The Ansbacher deposit holders should be named. Anyone who held one of these accounts has, at least, very serious questions to answer. By the nature of these accounts we already know that most, if not all of them, were involved in massive tax evasion. The Ansbacher system of diverting money through a maze of offshore accounts was described by High Court Justice McCracken as &ldquo;ingenious&rdquo;. Some of the biggest names in Irish business and politics were involved and the late Des Traynor presided at this elite club for tax evaders. The system was geared, in his own words, &ldquo;to minimising the footprints&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This golden circle defrauded their fellow citizens of massive sums due in taxation and thus deprived children of proper education and the sick of adequate health care. In one two year period during the 1980s when the Ansbacher accounts were operating, 20 per cent of hospital beds were closed because of cutbacks imposed by the party whose election slogan was &ldquo;health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The revelations from the Ansbacher investigation, the tribunals and the DIRT inquiry have uncovered a culture of fraud among the wealthy and privileged in society. Many of the names are in the open and their activities have come as no surprise to most citizens. However, what causes most anger is the fact that these fraudsters have operated with absolute impunity. The current investigations reveal the complete failure of the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Director of Public Prosecutions and, above all, successive Governments to confront those who use their positions of privilege to defraud their fellow citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Banks and other financial institutions actively encouraged wealthy depositors to evade tax. There was intense competition within and between banks to secure such custom, but what was the State's reaction? We can see that the reaction ranged from inefficiency in combating this abuse to deliberately turning a blind eye to indulgence. This culminated in the notorious tax <Col N="631" /> amnesties &ndash; surely among the most shameful measures introduced by any Government in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>If I have one reservation about this motion it is its reference to a new national agreement, by which it means the partnership agreement coming to an end. The Ansbacher revelations and the daily reports from the tribunals and the DIRT inquiry reveal what a misnomer the so-called partnership really is. Where was the sharing which partnership implies when some of the wealthiest in our society, many of them leading employers, were doing everything in their power to evade tax? While PAYE workers were urged to observe pay restraint and to continue to suffer an unjust taxation system which over-burdened them, particularly the lowest paid, those most able to carry the burden were contemptuous of their obligations to society.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion from Deputy Quinn that revenue recovered as a result of the current investigations should be ring-fenced and returned to taxpayers. I strongly believe that this is a flawed suggestion and misses the point. The Ansbacher abuses were not an aberration. They were entirely consistent with our fundamentally unequal economic system which rewards greed and creates need. What is required is fundamental tax reform and the allocation of resources, not to tax cuts or special once-off bonuses, but to the provision of real health and education care and the range of essential services which our citizens need.</P>
    <P>It is time to name and shame those who profited from the misery of so many. It is also time to learn the lessons of the Ansbacher and other financial scandals brought to public attention in the recent past. We will be looking to Government in the forthcoming budget to put these lessons to the test and into practice.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I will be voting for the motion, despite my reservations about the reference to a national wage agreement. This debate has been dominated by the selective leaking to the press of some names allegedly associated with the Ansbacher accounts. That is a pity because it has diverted attention from the real meaning of the revelation concerning Ansbacher. This was not an operation involving a few, errant or rotten individuals. This involved a substantial circle of the capitalist establishment, captains of industry and leaders of commerce whose tentacles spread into all areas of society, including semi-State companies, banks and so on. Described in a Sunday newspaper as &ldquo;the unacceptable face of Irish capitalism&rdquo; it is, in fact, the inevitable face of Irish capitalism &ndash; a system built on greed and exploitation of the many by a few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political establishment carries serious culpability. What was the 1993 tax amnesty except an endorsement of the fact that a powerful, wealthy minority, who had defrauded the tax system, could do so with impunity? When the Leader of <Col N="632" /> the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil backbenchers denounce Ansbacher they should remind themselves that if Ansbacher people declared under the tax amnesty there is nothing that could be done &ndash; they would go scot free. At the time of the amnesty, compliant and hard pressed PAYE taxpayers were being hounded and had, for example, their water cut off if they objected to an unfair double taxation by way of water charges. We have had a deluge of scandals involving business and sections of the political establishment. Somebody should do a chronicle and put them all together &ndash; tax fraud in the banks, bribery in the planning process and building industry, crookery in the beef industry and land deals involving semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>If I had time I would write a chronicle called &ldquo;A day in the life of Ansbacher man&rdquo; which would involve breakfast with Des Traynor where one would discuss the Ansbacher account and getting a loan which could be written off against one's taxes. This might be followed by morning coffee with the bank manager to discuss a few bogus non-resident accounts &ndash; Ansbacher man being prudent not to keep all the golden eggs in one basket, that is if Ansbacher man was not a director of the bank himself and had all the information to hand. Ansbacher man may then be a guest speaker at a prestigious business lunch attended by the Minister for Finance where he would dwell on two themes, namely, the need to drastically cut public spending and the absolute requirement for workers' wages to be held down. The Minister of Finance would probably flatter Ansbacher man with an eye to the generous political contribution he hopes his political party will get on foot of an obsequious letter sent by his general secretary to Ansbacher man and his firm. Ansbacher man would wheel and deal perhaps in the afternoon and may then head to the Bahamas for the weekend where he would join some of his other Irish millionaire friends who do not spend as much time in Ireland because their sense of patriotism is such that they are tax exiles from the country. No doubt their conversation would revolve around the forthcoming national wage agreement and the absolute priority of hammering wages down to the very minimum and increasing productivity. The system is rotten to the core and it is time these people were exposed.</P>
    <P>Cement Roadstone Holdings comes up again and again in this context. Ansbacher was run from its offices, a majority of its directors had associations with it and its chairman was the bagman for a former Taoiseach. The purchase by it of State lands for a song with no public tender must be investigated. Deputy Roche has a brass neck to castigate the Dáil when he himself voted against motions tabled by me and others that it be investigated by the Moriarty tribunal. The Taoiseach, the leader of the Deputy's party, appointed a chairman to that tribunal who had £500,000 in CRH. The system is rotten to the core and it is high time it was exposed. The names <Col N="633" /> should be published and the chips allowed to fall where they will.</P>

      <P>The examination by officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the books and documents of Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd. under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, is certainly the most valuable preliminary investigation undertaken in the scale and character of the wrongdoing which has apparently been uncovered. I want to acknowledge in particular the remarkable work which Mr. Gerard Ryan and his team has put into this investigation and into his other investigations, many of which are nearing completion.</P>
      <P>The circumstances outlined in my Department's affidavit presented to the High Court last Wednesday suggest that Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd. systematically flouted Irish banking, taxation and company law over a period of 20 years. It also appears that some of its clients may also have been a party to a number of these breaches. Having examined Mr. Ryan's report and taken legal advice, the Tánaiste was fully satisfied that the appointment of High Court inspectors was necessary to get to the bottom of what was revealed in the report. I believe there is widespread support for her continuing determination to uncover the practices which appear to have been the norm with this company.</P>
      <P>The inspectors have been required by the High Court to investigate the scale and character of Ansbacher's Irish business, to name those involved in the Ansbacher operation, to identify what Irish laws have been breached and the persons responsible in each case. It was suggested to the High Court last week that companies associated with Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd. may themselves have breached companies or other legislation. The remit of the inspectors is a comprehensive one which permits them to investigate related issues. It is my belief that the High Court has given the inspectors substantial discretion which will allow full information on this very complex affair to be disclosed to the High Court in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been disclosed to date is based principally on a limited amount of documents made available to Mr. Ryan for the purposes of his investigations. He has necessarily had to rely on the books and documents of Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Ltd. and Irish Intercontinental Bank Ltd. to which Mr. Ryan is also appointed to gather information on Ansbacher's business over the last 20 years. No original documentation of Ansbacher books and documents was made available to Mr. Ryan and he received no co-operation from Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd. Under section 19(4) of the 1990 Act, an authorised officer is only permitted to require past or present officers of the companies being examined by him or persons in possession of company documentation to attend for interview. Such interviews as were held <Col N="634" /> were restricted under section 19(4)(a)(ii) to require an explanation of whatever limited documentation was available.</P>
    <P>Despite the astonishing revelations in my Department's affidavit, we are a long way short as things stand of reaching definitive conclusions on Ansbacher's Irish business and on breaches of Irish law by the company and others. The statutory powers conferred on inspectors in the Companies Act, 1990, are very wide and will remove a number of the handicaps suffered by Mr. Ryan in his assignment. For instance, the inspectors may require under section 10 of the 1990 Act the production of all books and documents of, or relating to, the company from its officers and agents, from clients of Ansbacher and from other third parties such as banks who may be in possession of information concerning its affairs. The inspectors may interview each of these parties under oath and the Act requires that all reasonable assistance be given to the inspectors in connection with their investigation. In addition, the inspectors may seek the assistance of the High Court at any time. This may result in the giving of such directions as the court thinks fit, whether to the inspector or otherwise, with a view to ensuring that the inquiry is carried out as quickly and as inexpensively as possible.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the inspectors have all the necessary powers to expand considerably our level of knowledge about Ansbacher's operations and we can be confident, therefore, that the inspectors will be able to complete successfully the assignment which they have been given and which they have pursued with dedication, vigour and tremendous professionalism thus far.</P>
    <P>Once the inspectors' report has been completed, the High Court has wide powers to take appropriate action on foot of its contents. An example is the disqualification of any persons named in the report from acting as directors or auditors of a company or from managing any company for whatever period the court deems fit. However, the focus of public attention in recent days has been on publication of the report, and section 11 of the Companies Act, 1990, gives the court this power. I want to make it clear that the Government fully supports publication of the report and the Tánaiste intends to make the necessary representations to the court in favour of publication on its completion.</P>
    <P>In so far as the authorised officer's report is concerned, information relating to Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd. or any other companies examined under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990 is subject to strict confidentiality restraints and we must all live within the law. The key elements of section 21(1) of the 1990 Act states</P>
    <P>No information . relating to a body which has been obtained under section 19 . shall, without the previous consent in writing of that body, be published or disclosed, except to a competent authority .</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> Section 21(2) clearly provides that:</P>
    <P>A person who publishes or discloses any information, book or document in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>A breach of this section constitutes a criminal offence resulting in fines and/or imprisonment. In addition, the High Court ordered on 22 September last:</P>
    <P>And it is ordered that the restrictions on the disclosure of the exhibits referred to in the said affidavit of Paul Appleby sworn on the 26th day of July 1999 be continued, save for those opened and read in open court on this day.</P>
    <P>Only two of the 36 exhibits were read in open court last Wednesday and neither contained the list of Ansbacher clients which Opposition parties are seeking to have disclosed. In the circumstances, it is clear that it would be illegal for the Government under section 21 of the 1990 Act to publish any names and we would also be acting in contempt of the High Court order made on 22 September 1999 to do so. However, the Tánaiste has availed of the opportunities provided in section 21(3) of the Act to make information on the company available to the newly appointed inspectors to Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd., to the Minister for Finance, to certain persons authorised by him in the Revenue Commissioners and to the Central Bank. I believe the inspectors and the other parties should now be given the space to investigate fully the business activities of Ansbacher (Cayman) Ltd. in Ireland so that appropriate action can be taken against the parties involved in due course.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion and the Labour Party's Companies (Amendment) (No. 4) Bill, 1999, are both seeking to widen the circumstances in which disclosure of section 19 material may take place. In particular, both are seeking publication of the identities of Ansbacher account holders via the device of disclosure to a Dáil committee. We have recognised for some time the limitations of section 21, and during the debate on Committee Stage of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1999, last July, I tabled an amendment to section 21(3) to broaden the list of competent authorities who may be given section 19 information on a confidential basis. This amendment was accepted by the House, and I also undertook to consider a Labour Party amendment which would extend further the list of competent authorities to include &ldquo;either House of the Oireachtas or a Committee appointed by either or both of such Houses&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are still considering the matter, and it will no doubt be dealt with on Report Stage of the No. 2 Bill later in this session. However, the preliminary legal advice made available to the Government suggests that it would not be per<Col N="636" /> missible to use this device to allow the report to be made public in this way for a number of reasons. The report of the authorised officer, in so far as it contains findings of fact or conclusions, was not prepared with a view to publication. The State owes its citizens a duty to uphold their constitutional rights, and if such reports were to be publishable, persons named in the report would have to be given the prior right to see its contents relating to them and the opportunity to challenge them so that they could defend their reputations. A deliberate preliminary policy of name and shame would be wholly inconsistent with due process and might, I am advised, result in immunity from subsequent prosecution.</P>
    <P>The balance which is struck in section 21 preserves commercial confidentiality unless the information is relevant to the conduct by responsible competent authorities of their statutory responsibilities. The ban on needless disclosure is clearly helpful in securing the initial co-operation of a company to the examination of its books and records. Based on our experience, we must continue to be able to offer a real assurance that the confidentiality of a company's commercial affairs will be statutorily protected.</P>
    <P>If we fail to do so section 19 will become unworkable because any initiatives on our part to commence confidential preliminary examinations of company books and documents in appropriate cases will result in non co-operation from the target companies. The examinations will therefore become bogged down in lengthy judicial review proceedings. We have already seen from the Ansbacher case how valuable section 19 can be in exposing apparent illegality on a cost effective basis. Therefore, I would be very wary of taking any initiative which would jeopardise the value of this mechanism in rooting out possible wrongdoing where circumstances suggesting fraud or other unlawful conduct in the conduct of companies appear to have taken place. Neither am I prepared to undermine the work which is still ongoing on the present section 19 assignments.</P>
    <P>Publication of such material at this time will only assist those who may be guilty of fraudulent conduct. I do not want to see anyone &ldquo;beating the rap&rdquo; because of a sudden rush of blood in this one case. As leaders of our society, politicians must act responsibly. As guardians of the legislative process &ndash; and we are all legislators &ndash; we must respect the rule of law and due process. We should not allow ourselves to be equated with those associated with Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited. who appear to have disregarded the law for their own ends. We must accordingly uphold section 21 as it stands which we, as legislators, adopted in the Oireachtas, and we should respect established legal processes and constitutional safeguards.</P>
    <P>Last week's disclosures have rightly caused public outrage and, as the Fine Gael motion recognises, they do not assist in creating the climate for the achievement of a new national agreement. The naming of names of itself will not resolve this problem. It may in fact only com<Col N="637" /> pound it. If such illegal disclosures were to result in those who may be culpable of offences walking away scot free, more serious consequences would follow. The damage to the social fabric of our society and to respect for the rule of law could be far more serious in the longer term.</P>
    <P>Disclosures since the McCracken tribunal report have opened all our eyes to the scope for profit from white collar crime. As more information has become available on corporate malpractice, my Department has met the challenge by undertaking an unprecedented number of company law investigations, by initiating record numbers of prosecutions and by securing convictions for offences which have never previously been prosecuted under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>A simplistic approach to a complex issue is not going to resolve this problem. The only way that will be done is to ensure that the laws of this State are operated to the full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a sister of Mary Bannotti, one of the names leaked as one of the alleged club of 120. I reiterate what Mary Bannotti has said publicly &ndash; she never has banked with Guinness and Mahon, never had any kind of account in Ansbacher Cayman and had never heard of college trusts until she read about them in the newspaper in the last few days.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed by the bleating and crocodile tears of the Government parties about the need for natural justice and due process, saying that we cannot make these names available because we might damage someone's good reputation. What about the names that are already out in the public arena? What about their right to due process and to fair procedures? I can tell at first hand how painful this has been to at least one of the names and the family of my late colleague, Hugh Coveney, has also suffered immeasurably. People's houses are being staked out; the media has a job to do and will continue to try to get these names, to blacken more names and to put names of the guilty into the public arena in an unstructured fashion unless this Government wakes up to its responsibilities. I am sick to the stomach when I hear people such as Deputy Roche talking about due process and natural justice. What about the natural justice for the people whose names have already been leaked? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is predicated on the fact that we want to ensure that the names of the people who have been systematically evading tax are brought into the public arena and successful prosecutions are carried out. I object to the allegation made by the Tánaiste and others that this motion and the Labour Party amendment to the Companies Bill are about curiosity. How dare the Tánaiste accuse elected parliamentarians of using the parliamentary system to bring forward amendments to legislation? We are not asking for the names to be published without a change to section 21 so the names can published once those involved have been informed. Does the Minister understand the pain of someone waking up and the first <Col N="638" /> she knows about £840 of cheques is when she reads it in <i>The Irish Times</i>? The people who have given these names are reputable journalists so someone is giving them sight of this report or parts of it.</P>
    <P>I did a trawl of the Tánaiste's affidavit to the court last night and she has already named at least 40 companies or individuals with some involvement in Ansbacher. The labyrinthine system which was set up is devastating in its complexity and is devastating to all compliant taxpayers, both PAYE and self-employed business people &ndash; and there is a small coterie of self-employed who run businesses and are compliant with their taxes. The Tánaiste has already said, as did the Minister today, that she has not identified the client list but she has identified that eight out of 15 people who are directors of CRH had Ansbacher deposit accounts. It does not take much deduction to work out who the eight were.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste in her affidavit had to give some evidence to the courts and I can understand why she had to do that. It is interesting that not one of the names in <i>The Irish Times </i> was among those mentioned in the affidavit. In other words, whatever the basis for their names being on a list, if they are on it &ndash; and we do not know that &ndash; or on any kind of list, it was not mentioned in the affidavit. I can understand the anger of those people and I do not understand why the Government claims, as the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, said, that the release of those names would be a breach of law. If the Tánaiste and the Government accept it is a breach of law, why have they done nothing to prevent further names appearing in the paper? </P>
    <P>I reiterate what Deputy John Bruton said last night, that they should go to the Garda Commissioner, authorise him as an officer, let him decide whether there have been leaks and, if so, commence a prosecution. The penalties are £1,000 fine or 12 months in jail. If somebody has knowingly given out names, which are either right or wrong, they deserve to be in jail, because it is they who will be complicit in a failed prosecution if the publishing of the names, in the way they have been published, is used by a good lawyer in court to prevent a prosecution. That is why Fine Gael is calling for a structured way of releasing the names. Surely the Ministers can see that the surreptitious leaking of the names, in a non-structured way, is precisely what may be used in court by a good barrister to say, &ldquo;Your Honour, my client had no idea their name was going to appear, they had no forewarning, they had no chance to defend themselves, they were not even asked for anything before their name appeared in the paper.&rdquo;  It is much more likely that the release of the names in a proper way will allow a judge to say, &ldquo;Yes, the name was in the paper but I am satisfied that your client was not in any way damaged by the release of their name.&rdquo;  That would give them a chance to say they were not guilty, or that they had an account or that they knew nothing about it. That is the best way of ensuring a fair prosecution. As sure as night follows day, this weekend and probably the follow<Col N="639" /> ing weekend and the weekend after, more names will be found. People's houses are being staked out &ndash; somebody will say something they should not say.</P>
    <P>I turn to the Tánaiste's robust defence of the decision not to change the law. She said she cannot do it. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, when we spent about seven hours in the committee room discussing the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, on Committee Stage, said his Department had been worried for some time about the extent of the competent authorities, yet the Bill was published only last March and this amendment was not in it. The amendment appeared on the list on 21 July. It is clear the Government only copped on to the need for extending the competent bodies after the report had been submitted to the Minister on 22 June.</P>
    <P>I read what the Minister said last night and I listened to her. It is fair to say the Minister got the report first and her Department had it until the end of July without anybody else being authorised to have it and no leaks occurred. Is it not very interesting that the leaks only began to occur when the list of authorised people was extended? I am very suspicious about that. I believe the Tánaiste when she said she kept her copy of the report close to her chest, as did her officials. We did not even know she had it from 22 June until she informed us in her contribution last night. I did not know she had it that long. It was not until the end of July, when she went to the court to seek the appointment of an inspector, that she gave it to the Taoiseach. From that time onwards the information has been coming out, and more recently in the past few days when the list was widened yet again. I accept the Tánaiste's word that she has not leaked it, but neither she nor the Taoiseach said at any stage who in their Departments, whether it was advisers or others, had sight of it. Was this report left on a desk or was it constantly locked in a safe? I know as a former Minister for Justice that many documents I had went straight into a safe when I knew they should not be seen by anybody, not even my private secretary or the Secretary General. If I was told that documents were for my eyes only they went into my safe and I opened it when I wanted that document. We need to know what happened to these documents.</P>
    <P>Last night I reread the order from the High Court dated 22 September. The Minister has said she cannot change the law, she cannot extend the list of competent authorities to include a Dáil committee, she cannot change the rule about restricting publication of any of the documentation, her hands are tied and she cannot legislate retrospectively. Will the Minister of State explain why the following section is in the court order from the judge who heads this case?</P>
    <P>It is ordered that the applicant is at liberty to furnish to the sole chairman of the tribunal of inquiry payments to Mr. Michael Lowry the exhibits referred to at paragraph 16 of the affidavit of Paul Appleby sworn on the 26th day of July, 1999.</P>
    <P>At the time the Minister went into court and the report was published and given to her on 22 June and all through Mr. Ryan's examination &ndash; I com<Col N="640" /> mend him for the work he has done &ndash; a tribunal of inquiry was not a competent authority. We know the Government accepts that because it has put in an amendment which is not yet law to change the competent authority list to include a tribunal of inquiry. Yet on 22 September, no doubt at the Minister's request to the court, the court has changed the law and added in a tribunal of inquiry as a competent authority. What is different and why is that all right? The courts have every right to do this but why is it all right when the Minister says she cannot change the law to add to a competent authority list? I want an explanation for this because the judge has extended the law retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan when questioning the exhibits of Mr. Dunne &ndash; Chapter 16 is about Mr. Dunne &ndash; did not know, but his lawyers would have told him, that this would not be going to a tribunal of inquiry. Yet the Minister has not said that such an order by the court is negating Mr. Ryan's work. This court order further goes on to say:</P>
    <P>And it is ordered that the restriction on the disclosure [and it is mentioned by the Minister in her amendment] of the exhibits referred to in the said affidavit of Paul Appleby sworn on the 26th day of July be continued, save those opened and read to open court on this day.</P>
    <P>Why did the court need to do that if the law says there was a restriction? If the court took on to itself the competency to reiterate the restriction on the non-disclosure of these documents, the court can equally, with a case properly made by the Minister, go back on that particular order and say, &ldquo;In view of the fact that some names have been leaked out, that some people's reputations are being tarnished, that some people who are guilty, whose names might be out in the open, will be able to use this as a stick to beat a future court case .&rdquo;. Why did the judge feel he had to reiterate the restriction on the order? Why cannot the Minister, if she is not willing to accept our proposal, go back into the court and say, &ldquo;In view of what has transpired since 22 September, I now believe it is right that you lift the restriction of silence under certain circumstances so I can publish the names to allow people's good names to be vindicated&rdquo;. Nobody has referred to this throughout the debate. I read the Minister's speech today and it is interesting that not once did either Minister refer to the fact that they requested the judge to extend the law, as it currently exists, before the enactment of the new companies Bill.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take Deputy John Bruton's advice and send this report to the Garda Commissioner. If not &ndash; he is absolutely certain that whoever has leaked this report has breached the law &ndash; the Minister and the Government may be complicit in a failed prosecution of some of these people whose names may or may not yet be in the public arena. I urge the Government not to leave itself open to that charge and to send this report to the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <P>Agus mé ag caint aréir ar an ábhar seo bhí me buartha mar gheall ar staid na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí tar éis a bheith ag éisteachtaí le mo chomhTheachtaí ó cheantair Ghaeltachta. Ní cheart dom cloí leis an meon sin mar tá an Ghaeilge á cur chun cinn go forleathan ar fud na tíre agus sa Ghaeltacht féin. An tslí is fearr leis an Ghaeilge a chinntiú in aon áit ná díriú ar na daoine óga agus cloistear dom go bhfuil an t-údarás ag tabhairt cúnaimh do bhreis is 80 naíonra Gaeltachta. Bíonn tuismitheoirí sa Ghaeltacht a mbíonn Gaeilge lag ag duine den lanúin agus cabhraíonn na naíonraí leo siúd.</P>
      <P>Ní maith liom a chlos go bhfuil idirdhealú á dhéanamh idir ghaelscoileanna na tíre agus na scoileanna Gaeltachta. Ba chóir go bhfaigheadh gach scoil atá ag teagasc trí Ghaeilge na hacmhainní céanna ón Roinn agus ba mhaith go bhféachfadh an tAire chuige nach mbeadh aon idirdhealú ann in ainneoin go bhfuil ainmneacha difriúla orthu.</P>
      <P>Dírím freisin ar chlubanna óige Gaeltachta a bhfuil sé an-deacair orthu oifigigh agus oibrithe eile deonacha a fháil. Bíonn siad ag brath ar obair dheonach agus ba chóir cúnamh airgid a thabhairt dóibh chun áiseanna cearta a cheannach agus daoine a fháil ó FhÁS más gá. Tá cuid de na clubanna seo in áiteanna iargúlta agus tá sé deacair ar dhaoine cónaí ina leithéid d'áiteanna. Ní haon ionadh go n-imíonn daoine go minic as áiteanna dá leithéid chomh luath agus a bhíonn oideachas orthu. Sin ról dúshlánach don údarás agus don Aire agus d'aon duine atá ag déileáil le daoine óga sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
      <P>Maidir le cúrsaí oideachais do pháistí Gaeltachta, tá Conamara faoi bhuntáiste de bhrí go bhfuil cathair na Gaillimhe sách cóngarach dóibh agus is féidir leo cúrsaí a dhéanamh ansin trí mheán na Gaeilge. Ní hamhlaidh i nGaeltachtaí eile agus tá sé deacair daoine óga a choimeád sna Gaeltachtaí eile muna bhfuil fostaíocht ann dóibh.</P>
      <P>Aithním go bhfuil an t-údarás an-mhisniúil agus go bhfuil athrú dearcthaidh tagtha orthu ó bunaíodh iad. Ní fada ó bhí an fheirmeoireacht agus an fheirmeoireacht éisc mar bhunchloch ag eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta ach i láthair na huaire is é an innealltóireacht leictreonach atá tagtha ina áit. Tá céimeanna á bhaint amach ag daoine óga na Gaeltacht sna tionscail hi-tech agus ba mhaith an t-údarás ag díriú ar mhonarchana den tsórt sin a mhealladh isteach sa Ghaeltacht, monarchana nach mbeadh ag brath ar infrastruchtúr chomh mór sin ach ar scileanna an aosa óig.</P>
      <P>Nuair atáthar ag iarraidh tionsclóirí a mhealladh go dtí áit ar bith sa tír seo, caithfear dul sa tseans uaireanta. Chuaigh an t-údarás sa tseans go minic agus theip orthu anois is arís agus tá moladh ag dul dóibh as dul sa tseans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> Aithním go bhfuil dearcadh idirnáisiúnta ag an údarás agus go bhfuil oifig acu sa Bhruiséil maraon le ceangail láidir leis an Bhreatain Bheag agus Alba. Is féidir le tíortha beaga le teangacha neamhfhorleathana cabhrú lena chéile ar an dóigh seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom dearcadh náisiúnta níos fearr a bheith ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus go mbeadh comhoibriú ann idir na heagrais éagsúla atá ag obair ar son na Gaeilge, eagrais ar nós Gael-Linn, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge agus grúpaí nach iad. Maím toisc go bhfuilim ar bhord Gael-Linn gur eagraíodh Gael-Linn comórtas spóirt do dhaoine óga na Gaeltachta. Tháinig siad le chéile i Ráth Cairn agus b'in slí amháin chun comhoibriú a chur ar bun idir na heagrais. Ní chóir go mbeadh pobail Ghaeltachta scartha amach ó phobail Ghaeltachta eile mar is sa teacht le chéile a fhaightear léargas ar bheocht na Gaeltachta iomláin agus ar an uimhir mhór daoine atá sásta Gaeilge a labhairt.</P>
    <P>An t-aon chur amach atá agam ar na Gaeltachtaí agus ar an údarás ná ó Theilifís na Gaeilge agus ó Raidió na Gaeltachta. Gan fís phleanála agus bheartais dearfa ag an údarás, ní bheadh an rath céanna ar TG4, mar a thugtar air anois. Nó ní sa Ghaeltacht a bheadh formhór na bpost ar ardchaighdeán atá curtha ar fáil ag TG4. Bhíothas ag caint ar chainéal teilifíse Gaeilge a bhunú leis na blianta ach b'iad an t-údarás a rinne an gníomh agus bhí sé de mhisneach acu dul sa tseans leis. Chuir siad bunús ciallmhar faoin díospóireacht maidir le costas, bonneagar agus eile agus gan amhras fuair siad cuidiú ó gach páirtí san Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Aithním go bhfuil an t-údarás ag obair i TG4 le FÁS agus le RTÉ agus molaim an tslí ar cruthaíodh 250 post do dhaoine le hardscileanna sa Ghaeltacht san earnáil seo agus an chosúlacht air go rachaidh sé i méid.</P>
    <P>Aon uair a mbím ag caint ar Raidió na Gaeltacht buailim le daoine i mó Dháilcheantar féin i nDún Laoghaire a bhíonn ag éisteacht leis. Tá líon mór daoine ar fud na tíre a éisteann leis do na sárchláir a bhíonn á gcraoladh acu. Tá siad ag sábháil ní amháin na Gaeilge ach scéalaíocht agus samhlaíocht na Gaeilge freisin. Is acmhainní luachmhara iad seo.</P>
    <P>Is cinnte go bhfuil a luach ag dul i méid agus tá súil agam go mbeidh na stáisiúin seo agus gach aon duine eile in ann cabhrú lena chéile chun go mbeidh todhchaí ann don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is as cúlra Galltachta domsa agus déanaim mo chuid ar son na Gaeilge. Ach bheinn an-éadóchasach do thodhchaí na teanga má théann an Ghaeilge i léig sna Gaeltachtaí. Sin an fáth go bhfuil an t-údarás chomh tábhachtach sin, chun cuidiú leo siúd atá chomh báúil sin leis an teanga.</P>
    <P>An grúpa is fearr chun cabhrú leo ná Roinn an Aire Stáit mar is acu siúd atá an chumhacht is mó. Molaim an obair atá déanta go dtí seo ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son na n-oileán ach tá i bhfad níos mó comhoibrithe ag teastáil idir na ranna éagsúla  &ndash; oideachas, tionscail, Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Nílimid ag caint faoi dhílárú ach faoin <Col N="647" /> saibhreas is mó atá againn sa tír seo, ár dteanga, an Ghaeilge.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Baineann an Bille seo le socruithe maidir le struchtúir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus cúrsaí toghchánaíochta agus tá sé go breá chomh fada agus a théann sé. An rud is tábhachtaí áfach ná conas tabhairt faoi na fadhbanna móra atá ag Gaeltachtaí inniu de bharr an brú millteanach atá orthu maidir le teanga agus gnéithe eile den chultúr.</P>
      <P>Tá gá le smaoineamh nua a dhéanamh i dtaobh na bhfadhbanna seo agus táimid ag brath ar an Roinn agus ar an Aire teacht chun cinn le smaointe nua chun seasamh agus tabhairt faoin dúshlán atá ann. Tá teanga ársa againn sa tír seo a bhfuil corp mór amhránaíochta agus filíochta agus cultúir ag baint lei. Tá áilleacht thar cuimse ag baint lei freisin ach níl sí á labhairt ag formhór mhuintir na tíre faoi láthair. Mar sin tá sí á fágáil chun deiridh de réir mar a théann cúrsaí teicneolaíochta, cumarsáide agus eolaíochta chun cinn  &ndash; mar a théann saol an lae inniu chun cinn. Fágann sin fadhb uafásach don Ghaoluinn maidir le gnáthshaol na tíre. Chímid go bhfuil an domhan uilig ag dul i laghad ar shlite áirithe: tá teangacha móra an domhain ag dul i bhfeidhm ar shlite áirithe ar níos mó daoine agus an Béarla ina measc. Tá brú millteanach ar chainteoirí dúchasacha Gaeilge ón mBearla i láthair na huaire agus go mór mór ar an aos óg Gaeltachta. Má cuimhnímid ar an oiread sin de na meáin chumarsáide atá ag dul isteach sa Ghaeltacht gach lá i mBéarla ar ndóigh, is féidir linn a thuiscint an tionchar rí-mhór atá ag na meáin ar an aos óg ansin ach go háirithe. Ní dóigh liom go mbeidh an Ghaeilge á labhairt mar ghnáth-theanga sa tír seo riamh arís ag tromlach nó ag an daonra iomlán. Tá stair na tíre agus meáchan mór eacnamaíochta an domhain ina aghaidh sin.</P>
      <P>Ach dá mba rud é dá gcaillfí an teanga mar theanga labhartha i measc mhionlach den daonra  &ndash; agus is mionlach atá ann i láthair na huaire  &ndash; is tragóid uafásach a bheadh ann. Ach tá an dainséar ann gur sin mar a tharlóidh amach anseo. Ní ceart go dtarlódh ach tá an dainséar ann. Nuair a chailltear feithid nó planda atá gann ar dhromchla an domhain is tragóid é. Dá gcaillfí uirlis chumarsáide mar an Ghaoluinn, a bhfuil na mílte bliana de stair shaibhir taobh thiar di, tragóid amach is amach a bheadh ann.</P>
      <P>Ní féidir an tír seo a thuiscint gan eolas éigin a chur ar theanga stairiúil na tíre. Tá na mílte logainmneacha bunaithe ar an nGaeilge agus ní feidir ciall a bhaint as a n-ainmneacha gan an Ghaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le bheith dearfa faoi, is dócha go mbeidh mionlach ann i gcónaí sa tír a bheas ag iarraidh eolas a bheith acu ar an nGaoluinn. Agus tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil na gaelscoileanna ag dul ar aghaidh go maith agus go bhfuil an teanga ag daoine óga lasmuigh de na Gaeltachtaí agus iad sásta í a labhairt. Nílim i bhfách leis an Ghaeilge a bhrú síos scórnaigh an aosa óig ach caithfimid <Col N="648" /> gach tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh siúd a dteastaíonn uathu eolas a chur ar an teanga agus do na hionaid sa tír ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo. Beidh tionchar mór ag an údarás nua ar an scéal seo agus beidh obair chrua rompu chun an tacaíocht chuí a thabhairt dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh an teanga a chaomhnú.</P>
    <P>Tá brú mór ar na limistéir Ghaeltachta i láthair na huaire agus dob fhéidir an brú sin a laghdú ar shlite áirithe. Cuireann sé isteach orm go bhfuil scéimeanna tithíochta samhraidh á gcur chun cinn ar fud na Gaeltachta  &ndash; i gCorca Dhuibhne, mar shampla, mar ab as dom féinig  &ndash; ag lucht gnó agus lucht forbartha.</P>
    <P>Tá an-dainséar anseo go dtiocfaidh brú níos troime fós ar mhuintir na Gaeltacha má thugtar cead a gcinn dóibh siúd ar mian leo brabús mór a dhéanamh gan an dochar a bheadh á dhéanamh acu do chultúr na Gaeltachta á chur san áireamh acu. Deirim é sin mar shóisialach agus mar idirnáisiúnaí. Ní ceart go mbeadh an meon againn go bhfuil an Ghaeilge níos fearr ná aon teanga nó aon chultúr eile. Ach tá an oiread sin brú ag teacht ón taobh amuigh go bhfuil sé ceart agus cóir go dtabharfaí gach tacaíocht dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh an teanga a chaomhnú.</P>
    <P>Má chiallaíonn sé sin srian a chur le saghasanna áirithe forbartha sa Ghaeltacht ba chóir go ndéanfaí amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Fadhb mór eile i nGaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne faoi láthair  &ndash; agus teastaíonn uaim é a rá agus an tAire Stáit anseo  &ndash; ná todhchaí an Bhlaoscaoid Mhóir. Nuair a ritheadh Acht tríd an Dáil chun páirc náisiúnta a chruthú ar an mBlascaod Mór, cheapamar go raibh éacht déanta agus go raibh obair iontach Fhondúireacht an Bhlascaoid tugtha chun críche. Bhí daoine tar éis a ndícheall a dhéanamh chun an t-oileán a chaomhnú mar ionad oidhreachta agus cultúrtha agus mar pháirc náisiúnta stairiúil. Ach níor chuireamar san áireamh ag an am an craos airgid ag mionlach bheag a thug faoin Acht seo a scrios. Agus faraor gur éirigh leo sa Chúirt Uachtarach le déanaí. Is é atá i gceist anois go bhfuil leas triúr nó ceathra curtha roimis leas na tíre, na Gaeltachta agus Chorca Dhuibhne ach go háirithe. Tá cead a gcinn tugtha do thriúr nó ceathrar a dteastaíonn uathu brabús mór a dhéanamh as an oileán. Muna ndéanann an Rialtas rud éigin dearfa go luath fágfar an t-oileán faoi lucht speiciléireachta agus scannal amach is amach a bheadh ann.</P>
    <P>Is seod rí-luachmhar atá sa Bhlascaod Mhór ó thaobh áilleacht na háite ar ndóigh ach freisin ó thaobh na litríochta agus an chultúir atá ag baint leis. Tá iontas oibre ag an bhFondúireacht agus acu siúd a thug tacaíocht dó agus is breá an rud dul isteach go dtí Ionad na Fondúireachta agus a fheiscint ansin, pictiúir, stair agus scéalta an oileáin. Mar a dúirt an Criomhthánach, Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann. Dúirt George Thomson, scoláire a raibh an-suim aige sa Bhlascaod gur sampla an-déanach sa stair a bhí ann ar an saol réamhchaipitleach. Níor tharla a leithéid in áit ar bith eile sa domhan gur eascair an méid sin litríochta as áit bheag. Ba mhaith go nglacfadh an <Col N="649" /> tAire Stáit an seans chun a rá cad é go cruinn atá beartaithe ag an Rialtas a dhéanamh faoin scéal seo. Tá súil agam go léifidh an Rialtas cuid de na bunspriocanna a bhí le hAcht 1989 chun páirc stairiúil a dhéanamh ar an mBlascaod Mór mar is sárobair atá i gcuid de na haltanna. &ldquo;Déanfaidh na Coimisinéirí a bheidh i bhfeighil ar an pháirc náisiúnta an pháirc a bhainistiú, a chothú agus a rialú, a chosaint agus a fhorbairt mar pháirc a bhainfidh an pobal úsáid agus tairbhe aisti agus ina gcaomhnófar agus ina léireofar oidhreacht stairiúil, cultúr, traidisiún agus luachanna an oileáin agus a áitritheoirí agus ina ndéanfar flora, fauna agus tírdhreach an oileáin a chosaint. Agus cothóidh siad chomh maith agus cuirfidh siad chun cinn úsáid na páirce ag am bpobal mar ionad cultúir, oideachais, fóillíochta agus caithimh aimsire. Agus cothóidh siad agus cuirfidh siad chun cinn úsáid na Gaoluinne, tuiscint don oidhreacht náisiúnta agus mórtas aisti agus staidéar ar an oileán sin agus ar stair, oidhreacht, cultúr, béaloideas agus luachanna an oileáin agus a áitritheoirí agus féachfaidh siad le sainghnéithe traidisiúnta an oileáin a chaomhnú.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Teastaíonn sé sin ó gach duine sa Ghaeltacht agus ó fhormhór mhuintir na tíre agus tá an dualgas ar an Rialtas rud éigin a dhéanamh go han-tapa faoi seo. Chuir mé ceist ar an Taoiseach ar an maidir ar an ábhar seo agus ní bhfuair mé freagra deimhneach uaidh ar cad atá in aigne an Rialtais. Dúirt sé go raibh an Rialtas chun staidéar a dhéanamh ar an méid a tháinig as an gCúirt Uachtarach agus glacaim leis sin. Ach ba cheart go mbeadh an Rialtas sásta a rá lom díreach ó thaobh prionsabail de, nach bhfuil siad sásta an seod luachmhar seo a ligean le lucht speiciléireachta chun é a scrios, b'fhéidir, nó ar a laghad nach ndéanfar forbairt ar an oileán ó thaobh ionad oidhreachta de, mar ba chuí.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freagra a fháil ón Aire Stáit an bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Rialtas leasú a thabhairt chun cinn chun gur féidir Acht 1989 a leasú ionas gur féidir dul ar aghaidh le páirc náisiúnta a chruthú ar an mBlascaod. Má tá glactha ag an Rialtas leis an bprionsabal sin, titfidh gach rud eile ina áit diaidh ar ndiaidh. Ach ba chóir a rá le muintir Chorca Dhuibhne agus leis an mhuintir eile ar fud na tíre atá buartha faoin scéal seo, agus rogha a thabhairt dóibh siúd atá ag iarraidh airgead a dhéanamh as an oileán, go bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas an t-oileán a chaomhnú mar ionad oidhreachta agus cultúrtha. Tá sé seo mar chuid den méid atá le déanamh ó thaobh cultúr agus teanga na Gaoluinne a chaomhnú agus tacú lei sa tír seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo. Teachta ón iarthar mé agus cé nach bhfuil Gaeltacht i mó Dháilcheantar agam, tá suim ag muintir an Dáilcheantair sin sa Ghaeilge. Tá a lán gaelscoileanna ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is ceart féachaint ar struchtúr na n-údarás agus ar ndóigh beidh dúshláin os a chomhair sna blianta amach romhainn. Tá a lán bainte amach aige ó bunaíodh é fiche bliain ó shin i mí Eanáir 1980 <Col N="650" /> le 13 chomhalta ar an mbord  &ndash; seachtar á dtoghadh go daonlathach ag pobal na Gaeltachta agus seisear á ainmniú ag an Aire. Is struchtúr maith atá ann faoi láthair, struchtúr nach bhfuil ag aon bhord Stáit eile.</P>
    <P>I 1980 bhí níos mó ná 4,000 dhuine fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht ach faoi thús na bliana seo bhí breis is 8,000 fostaithe ann go lánaimseartha i bpoist a fuair cúnamh ón údarás.</P>
    <P>Tá an tionscail closamhairc sa Ghaeltacht ag soláthar cláir den scoth do TG4 cosúil le Ros na Rún a bhfuil an-tóir ag an bpobal air.</P>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an straitéis atá ag an údarás agus dá bharr tá fás ag teacht ar thograí Gaeltachta ar nós an phróiseáil éisc agus an fheirmeoireacht agus forbairt aerseirbhísí. Ba mhaith comhghairdeas a rá leis an Aire Stáit as na forbairtí sin agus as ucht airgead a fháil do bhóithre agus do chéibheanna na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Uaireanta bíonn saghas éad orainn i nGaillimh Thoir ag féachaint ar an bhforbairt mhór seo sa Ghaeltacht nuair nach bhfuil an fhorbairt chéanna á dhéanamh ar bhailte bheaga taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá díomá orm nach bhfuil bord Stáit cosúil leis an údarás ag plé leis na háiteanna iargúlta go léir. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an Western Development Commission in ann an rud céanna a dhéanamh taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. I nDáilcheantar an Chláir, Luimnigh agus Chiarraí tá SFADCO ag déanamh jab iontach sna contaetha sin agus caithfimid an rud céanna a dhéanamh san iarthar.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a rá leis an údarás as ucht an cúnamh atá á thabhairt acu chun an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú go háirithe i gcás clubanna óige agus féilte áitiúla. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil cabhair tugtha acu freisin do na ceardchumainn agus do na tionscail nua turasóireacht chultúrtha.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil níos mó ná 8,000 dhuine fostaithe sa Ghaeltacht, tá bailte beaga ann nach bhfuil ag fás. Tá a fhios againn go léir má fhágann daoine an Ghaeltacht go mbeidh sé níos deacra an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú. Tá tarraingt mhór chuig na cathracha: tá méadú mór tar éis teacht ar dhaonra chathair na Gaillimhe agus déanfar an-dochar don Ghaeilge má imíonn an iomarca daoine isteach ann ón nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Inné luadh an Council for the West agus an bhéim atá ar na bailte móra a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt. Luadh Gaillimh agus Litir Ceanainn mar dhá bhaile mór ar chóir níos mó forbartha a dhéanamh air de réir tuairisc ón ESRI agus ní aontaím leis sin.</P>
    <P>Tréaslaím leis an Aire as ucht an t-údarás a leathnú. Faoi láthair tá 13 chomhalta ar bhord an údaráis agus faoin mBille seo is fiche comhalta a bheas air. Beidh seans ag na Gaeltachtaí beaga duine a thoghadh ar an mbord  &ndash; toghfar 17 den líon sin agus ceapfaidh an tAire an triúr eile. Tá líon na dtoghlach don údarás á mhéadú ó thrí cinn go dtí seacht gcinn, sé sin toghlach ar leith i ngach contae ina bhfuil limistéar Gaeltachta. Mar sin beidh ionadaí ag Gaeltacht na Rinne agus ag Gaeltacht na Mí ar bhord an údaráis feasta. <Col N="651" /> Beidh deis mhaith ag ceantair bheaga Gaeltachta sna mórchontaetha Gaeltachta ionadaí a thoghadh chomh maith. Mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit, bhíodh na Gaeltachtaí beaga ag gearán nach mbíodh ionadaí acu ar an údarás.</P>
    <P>Rinne an tAire Stáit tagairt freisin don ról atá aige agus ag an Roinn agus ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Coiste Meastóireachta a luaigh an tAire Stáit. Déanfaidh an Coiste Meastóireachta scrúdú ar thograí a chuirfear faoi bhráid an Aire faoi láthair agus déanfaidh siad moltaí ina leith. Don chéad uair riamh beidh an coiste sin ar bhonn reachtúil.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh an toghchán a bheith ann roimh an 9ú Nollaig agus mar is eol don Teachta táthar ag gearán go mbeidh toghchán ann i mí na Samhna. Ní bhíonn an t-am oiriúnach riamh do thoghchán ar ndóigh ach bhí orainn na toghcháin a chur ar ceal i mí an Mheithimh toisc na toghcháin eile a bhí ag tarlú ag an am. Bhí cúpla toghchán ann don Dáil i mí na Samhna agus i mí Eanáir agus Feabhra tríd na blianta agus bíonn gach toghchán deacair ar na hiarrthóirí agus ní dóigh liom sa chás seo gur féidir an toghchán a chur ar ceal arís. Guím gach rath ar na hiarrthóirí a bheas san iomaíocht agus tá súil agam go mbunófar údarás maith a dhéanfaidh sárobair do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Níorbh éasca don údarás thar na blianta. Bhí ganntanas airgid orthu go minic ach rinneadh infheistíocht chiallmhar i dtionscail agus clár gníomhaíochta á chur i bhfeidhm acu i ngach ceantar Gaeltachta anois. Is mór an obair atá déanta acu agus ag an Aire.</P>

      <P>Is Bille gairid agus níl aon rud réamhlóideach ann. Baineann sé le córas toghchánaíochta an údaráis agus leis sin amháin.</P>
      <P>Ag smaoineamh ar an méid a bhí geallta maidir le leasú an údaráis bhí mé ag cur cúpla ceist orm féin. Is cuimhin liom nuair a bhí cúram an údaráis orm féin mar Aire go gcuirfeadh an tAire Stáit ceisteanna orm maidir le cumhachtaí agus feidhmeanna an údaráis. Ina dhiaidh sin, tharla go raibh díospóireacht againn ar an gcóras institiúideach a ba chóir agus a ba chuí i leith cúrsaí na hEorpa agus i leith cúrsaí réigiúnda ach go háirithe. Is iontach an rud gur deineadh dearmad glan ar an údarás mar b'é an t-aon údarás amháin a raibh cuma réigiúnach air agus a bhí in oiriúint chun athrú go dtí córas ceart. Níl tada sa Bhille seo maidir le haon leasú fiúntach ar chumhachtaí an údaráis. Ó thaobh alt 9 den Phríomh-Acht, níl na hathruithe le feiscint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé suimiúil gur deineadh dearmad glan ar an údarás nuair a bhí an rí-rá ar siúl mar gheall ar dheimhniú na réigiún don Eoraip. Tháinig cúpla contae isteach chun cur le limistéar an údaráis agus ní raibh bac ar bith ar an Rialtas é sin a dhéanamh. Is féidir a fhoghlaim ón rud a tharla nach raibh tionchar ar bith ag Roinn an Aire Stáit ar thuairimíocht an Roinn Airgeadais. Chuir sé sin as go mór dóibh siúd a bhí ag plé leis an <Col N="652" /> údarás agus aontaím go bhfuil obair mhaith déanta acu.</P>
    <P>Is beag nár cuireadh deireadh leis an údarás sa bhliain 1981-2 nuair a bhí mé féin díreach tar éis teacht isteach sa Teach seo. Bhí rún os comhair an Tí an t-údarás a scor. Éalaíodh as nuair a mhol mé go mbeadh an t-údarás freagrach don coiste de na heagrais Stáit agus leath-Stáit agus glacadh leis sin.</P>
    <P>Leag an tAire Stáit an-bhéim ar na coistí réigiúnacha atá taobh istigh den údarás. Má léann sé an méid atá sa Roinn tuigfidh sé na gearáin a tháinig isteach ón struchtúr sin. Deir an tAire Stáit go bhfuil siad ag obair go sásúil anois ach is cuimhin liom cás amháin nuair a thóg fo-choiste de dhuine amháin cinneadh infheistíochta áirithe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuilim ag díriú ar nithe atá níos conspóidí ná mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit nuair a bhí sé ag caint inné.</P>
      <P>Tá athruithe i gceist ar struchtúr toghchánaíochta an údaráis amach anseo. Bhí roghanna eile ag an Aire Stáit. Ba mhaith liom a bheith féaráilte agus smaoineamh ar na hóráidí atá tugtha aige ar an ábhar seo. Táimid ar aon intinn faoi mhórán rudaí ach is dóigh gur luaigh sé uair amháin gur mhaith an rud comhairle na gcoistí a bheith ann  &ndash; federation  &ndash; mar atá i bparóistí éagsúla sna Gaeltachtaí éagsúla agus go mbeadh an federation freagrach as polasaí a cheapadh agus measúnú a dhéanamh agus go mbeadh executive ann chun an obair a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>B'fhiú a leíriú an t-athrú meoin atá tagtha ar an Aire Stáit ón am ar smaoinigh sé mar sin.</P>
      <P>Bhí sé de rogha aige freisin córas réigiúnach ceart a dhéanamh den údarás le cumhachtaí cuí. Phléigh muid é sin go minic ag cruinnithe poiblí nuair a bhíodh an tAire Stáit ag tabhairt amach faoin tionchar a bhí ag na boird sláinte agus ag na comhairlí contae ar na Gaeltachtaí agus chomh luath agus a gheobhadh sé féin an chumhacht chuige bheadh an tionchar malachtach sin á chur ar ceal. Bhí sé i ndáiríre agus bhí an ceart aige  &ndash; ainmneacha daoine á aistriú go Béarla ag Bord Sláinte an Iarthair agus an chomhairle contae ann agus gan aon ró-shuim aige i gcúrsaí Gaeltachta. Ach tá dearmad déanta ar sin anois. Leanfaidh an chomhairle contae ar aghaidh ag plé le Gaeilgeoirí trí Bhéarla ach déarfaidh an tAire Stáit go bhfuil sé sin faoi chaibidil aige sa Bhille Teanga atá beartaithe aige don bhliain 2010 nó don tarna rialtas i ndiaidh an ceann seo. Sa ghearrthréimhse ní thiocfaidh aon athrú air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh an bainisteoir contae breá sásta leis an mBille seo. Bhí liosta fada ag an Aire Stáit de na nithe a ba chóir don údarás a dhéanamh  &ndash; cumhachtaí éagsúla ag an údarás rudaí a mholadh agus a dhéanamh a bhaineann leis an gcomhairle contae  &ndash; liosta a théann siar go dtí an t-am a raibh an Teachta Ó Maoildhia ag plé leis. Bhíothas ag tabhairt amach faoin mbóthar beag <Col N="653" /> do Ché Ros a' Mhíl agus bhí an milleán ar an gcomhairle chontae. Bhí daoine ag rá nach raibh cumhacht go leor ar an údarás and nach dtógfadh sé ach athrú Rialtais le gach rud a chur ina cheart. Bíonn an tAire Stáit ag caint faoi chéanna. Tá cupla ceist le cur agam faoin chaoi ina bhfuil airgead á chaitheamh faoi láthair ar chéanna sa Ghaeltacht. B'fhéidir go dtiocfaidh mé ar ais má tá am agam chun an rud seo a phlé.</P>

      <P>Ach ní bhaineann an reachtaíocht le haon athrú bunúsach i gcumhachtaí an údaráis. Ní dhéanann sé aon rud réabhlóideach ó thaobh ionadaíocht an údaráis ná aon athrú bunúsach ó thaobh cuspóirí réigiúnda de. B'fhéidir go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó dóchas ag an Aire Stáit &ndash; agus beidh misneach ag teastáil uaidh chomh maith &ndash; nuair atá sé ag caint faoin ionadaíocht a bheas ann. Léigh sé litir ó cheardcumann MSF a bhfuil an chuid is mó de na daoine atá fostaithe san údarás ina mbaill de. Bhí moltaí acusan; aontaím leo. Fuair mé litir ó dhuine amháin ina ndearna sé tagairt to chóras na gcontaetha agus don chaoi ina rinne sé scrios ar a lán de na Gaeltachtaí. Bheadh an ceardchumann sásta athrú a dhéanamh ar bhunstruchtúr an údaráis. Sin rud réabhlóideach. Ní hamhlaidh don Aire Stáit nó don Aire ach an oiread.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin liom plé le seo nuair a bhí mé féin ag tabhairt reachtaíocht os comhair an Tí seo, ó thaobh Radio Telefís Éireann agus luaigh me ionadaíocht na n-oibrithe sa reachtaíocht i leith an Chomhairle Oidhreachta. Níl sé deacair próisis a chur ar bun ionas go dtoghfaí ionadaí ó na hoibrithe atá ag obair san údarás. Níl sin sa Bhille ach an oiread. Luaitear cupla státseirbhíseach agus daoine ón earnáil phríobháideach, daoine a bhfuil taithí acu ar chursaí gnó. Ar ndóigh, beidh deifir mhór ar lucht gnó na laethanta seo chun bheith ainmnithe ar an údarás. Ach tá sé de cheart ag na hoibrithe bheith ar an údarás. Is iad san atá ag plé, ó lá go lá, leis an méid atá le déanamh agus ba chóir go mbeadh a n-ionadaíocht siúd luaite sa Bhille.</P>
      <P>Beidh sé suimiúil féachaint cé hiad an triúr a ainmneoidh an tAire Stáit agus caithfidh mé píosa den arán a fháil. Tá tagairt ann do státseirbhíseach. Tá a fhios ag an domhan go n-oibríonn státseirbhísigh go dúthrachtach an t-am go léir agus go bhfuil suim acu i dtodhchaí na nGaeltachtaí, is cuma cén Rialtas atá ann, ach is fiú don Aire Stáit, agus freagra á thabhairt aige, léiriú dúinn cad a bhéas na státseirbhísigh ag déanamh dó ar an údarás. An mbeidh siad neamhspleách, an mbeidh siad ann mar ghnáthbhaill den údarás, an mbeidh seans acu rúin a mholadh nó cabhrú le rúin, dul i gcoinne nithe nó an mbeidh siad ann, mar a tharlaíonn go minic ar bhoird Stáit, chun fanacht ina dtost go dtí pointe áirithe&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sin an cheist atá á chur agam ar an Aire. Beidh seans ag an Aire Stáit léiriú go cruinn cén cuspóir a bhéas ag státseirbhísigh ar an údarás agus beimid ag fanacht ar sin. Deir an tAire Stáit nach bhfuil sé ag rá ach go mbeidh sé saorstát seirbhísigh á chur ar an mbord. An gcuirfidh an tAire Stáit státseirbhísigh ar an mbord nó nach gcuirfidh? Má tá sé chun sin a dhéanamh, cén fáth go bhfuil agus cén sort oibre a bhéas á dhéanamh acu? Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeidh an t-údarás neamhspleách go dtí an pointe go mbeidh aon duine atá ina bhall den bhord ag glacadh páirt mar ghnáthbhall den bhord agus go mbeidh an ceangal idir an Roinn agus an t-údarás soiléir. Tá mé sásta fanacht go ndéanann an t-Aire Stáit é sin a shoiléiriú duinn.</P>
      <P>Rinne an tAire Stáit tagairt don athrú atá tar éis teacht ar chursaí fostaíochta sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá sin fíor. Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil an t-Aire Stáit agus mé féin ar aon intinn gur ligeadh síos, thar na mblianta, na gnéithe teanga agus shóisialta d'fhorbairt na nGaeltachtaí. Níor tugadh cothrom na Féinne do chúrsaí soisialta. Bhí atmasféar fiontrach ann agus i bhfad níos mo béime á chur ar chuma nua-aimseartha a chur ar rudaí ná ar anailís a dhéanamh ar a bhí ag tarlú i leith teanga de. Caithfidh mé bheith ionraiciúil faoin tionscal closamhairc. Fuair mé féin litreacha ag cur ina choinne ó dhreamanna beaga. Bhí daoine ann a bhí lándáiríre agus amhrasach faoin tionchar a bheadh ag an tionscal sin ar chúrsaí teanga agus ar chúrsaí sóisialta. Ghlac mé lena raibh á rá acu go dtí an pointe sin, go gcaithfear bheith an-chúramach. Bhí daoine eile ann a cheap nár chóir go mbéadh aon rud nua-aimseartha sa Ghaeltacht agus bhíodarsan ina choinne. Bhí daoine i gcoinne Theilifís na Gaeilge, mar shampla, i ngach páirtí sa Dáil. Agus seo an chéad ócáid phoiblí a bhfuil seans agam a rá gur thaitin an teideal Teilifís na Gaeilge i bhfad níos mó liom ná TG4.</P>

      <P>Tá rud amháin suimiúil eile <Col N="655" /> nach bhfuil sa reachtaíocht agus atá le fáil in Acht Chraolacháin, 1993, agus sa reachtaíocht i leith an Chomhairle Oidhreachta. Sa dá Acht sin luaitear an tábhacht a bhaineann le ionadaíocht ban. Ní hamháin nach bhfuil sé luaite sa reachtaíocht ach tá tábhacht ag baint le seo i gcomhthéacs fostaíochta taobh istigh den údarás féin. Is cuimhin liom, uair amháin, gur thaispeáin mé diagram den arm do lucht an údaráis. Bhí a lán ginearáil ann ach, maidir le cursaí cearta fostaíochta, bhí na mná ar fad coinnithe faoi bhun an tsíleaíl ghloine, agus bhí an tsíleál an-íseal ar fad. Ní raibh sin cóir ag an am sin agus níl sé cóir fós. Chabhródh sé go mór leis an fhadhb seo a réiteach dá mba rud é go raibh rud so-fheicthe i reachtaíocht an údaráis a chuaigh i ngleic le cothromaíocht fir is mhná agus níl a leithéid ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Ó thaobh an rud a bhí i gceist agam, ba mhaith liom a bheith dearfa faoin reachtaíocht seo ach tá sé deacair. Bheinn i bhfábhar rud níos réamhlóidí a dhéanamh ach deir an tAire Stáit go bhfuil reachtaíocht eile le tabhairt isteach chun leasú a dhéanamh ar alt 9 den Phríomh-Acht chun na cumhachtaí sin atá ag an gcomhairle contae a thabhairt don údarás, chun feidhmeanna réigiúnda a thabhairt dóibh mar aon le feidhmeanna ó thaobh oideachais agus mar sin de. Beidh áthas orm cabhrú leis chuige sin.</P>
      <P>Chomh maith leis sin tá an Bille suimiúil mar léiríonn sé an dearcadh atá ag an Roinn Airgeadais ar an ábhar seo. Tá an chosúlacht ar an reachtaíocht seo gur thosaigh sé le liosta fada ach gur gearradh siar é. Is léir go bhfuil an tAire Stáit dáiríre faoi chúrsaí Gaeltachta ach nár éirigh leis an rud a bhí uaidh a fháil ón Roinn Airgeadais. Bhíodar i gcónaí níos mó i bhfách leis an IDA ná mar atá siad le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta. Chuir siad bac air agus tá sé an Coiste Meastóireachta á chur ar bun intuigthe agus cead á thabhairt ní amháin don Roinn Airgeadais ach don IDA, atá in iomaíocht leis an údarás, deireadh a chur le haon togra fiúntach a thagann ar an saol.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte mhór roimh an mBille seo agus tá moladh ag dul don Aire Stáit as. Nuair a bunaíodh an t-údarás fiche bliain ó shin, athrú mór a bhí ann ó Ghaeltarra Éireann mar ní raibh ach uimhir an-bheag de mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar a choiste. Don chéad uair leis an údarás bhí seans ag muintir na Gaeltachta roinnt mhaith daoine a cheapadh ar an mbord agus d'ainmnigh an tAire na baill eile. Leis an athrú seo, tá níos mó daoine le ceapadh ag muintir na Gaeltachta ionas go mbeidh guth níos mó acu ar an mbord nua. Gan dabht ní raibh aon chaint ann inné mar gheall ar an mó suíochán a bheidh ann don deisceart. Fuaireamar suíochán amháin i gCorcaigh agus bhíomar ag brath go bhfaighimis dhá cheann ach níor éirigh linn. Tá mé buíoch go bhfuil suíochán amháin againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá athrú mór tagtha ar an nGaeltacht le fiche bliain anuas. Tá sé soiléir ó a bheith ag gabháil timpeall na háite an méid tionscail atá bunaithe ann agus an méid daoine atá tagtha isteach sa <Col N="656" /> Ghaeltacht, ag caitheamh a gcuid airgid sa Ghaeltacht agus ag cónaí ann. An t-aon rud ná go mb'fhéidir go bhfuil an teanga ag fáil bháis beagán de bharr strainséirí a bheith ag teacht isteach. Níl an bhéim chéanna ar an dteanga anois is a bhíodh. Bheinn amhrasach mar gheall ar sin agus ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an t-údarás níos mó béime ar sin. Is cuimhin liom go rabhthas ag iarraidh go mbeadh Gaoluinn acu siúd a bheadh ag bunú tionscal sa Ghaeltacht, nó go bhfoghlaimeoidís Gaoluinn ionas go mbeidís in ann a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaoluinn agus tá sé sin ag tarlú ceart go leor ach níl a dhóthain de ann.</P>
    <P>Tá na Gaeltachtaí athraithe go mór thar na blianta agus samhlaítear dom go mbeidh an t-athrú sin le feiscint níos mó anois nuair a bheidh a mhuintir féin ann ar an mbord mar ní haon tairbhe do dhaoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht a bheith ag rá cad ar cheart agus cad nár cheart a dhéanamh ann. Na daoine is fearr chun é sin a rá ná na daoine atá ina gcónaí sa cheantar.</P>
    <P>Is cinnte go bhfuil an-obair déanta ag an Aire Stáit ar son na Gaeltachtaí le dhá bhliain anuas. Tá breisi airgid á chaitheamh iontu seachas mar a bhí. Tionscail ar fad a bhí i gceist go dtí sin agus tá athrú ann anois agus airgead á chaitheamh ar bhóithre agus eile. Cabhraíonn sé sin go mór leis an Ghaeltacht. Mar is eol d'éinne againn atá ar ag gcomhairle contae tá sé deacair príomhbhóthair nó bóithre maithe a chur isteach sna Gaeltachtaí dá mbeifí ag brath ar an gcomhairle chontae féin amháin. Chím go bhfuil difear mór ann nuair a bhíonn bóithre maithe ag dul isteach sna Gaeltachtaí mar ní áiteanna iargúlta a thuilleadh iad ansin. Tá sé go breá na tionscail a bheith againn ach caithfidh na bóithre a bheith againn freisin. Caithfidh slí a bheith ag monarcha earraí a thógaint isteach agus amach as an áit.</P>
    <P>Sin an portfolio atá ag an Aire Stáit agus molaim é as an obair atá á dhéanamh aige. Chím leis an údarás go bhfuil a dtuairimí féin acu agus níorbh aon díobháil dóibh bualadh le muintir na Gaeltachta ó am go ham go bhfeicfeadh siad cén saghas tuairimí ag an mhuintir sin maidir le nithe áitiúla agus chun tuilleadh tionscail a thabhairt isteach sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille agus na daoine sin a bheas ag seasamh don toghchán ag deireadh na bliana agus beimid ag súil le ré nua nuair a bheidh an bord nua ann. Tá an obair le déanamh acu tábhachtach. Chím go bhfuil daoine ag teacht isteach sa Ghaeltacht ag obair agus iad lánsásta turas fada a chur orthu féin chun an obair sin a dhéanamh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McCormack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish we were discussing the future of Údarás rather than this Bill. The elections were put off recently and I would prefer if they were put off to a later date to allow a full discussion on the future of Údarás which is a talking shop we have had for too long and it is one which has failed, particularly when it comes to industrial policy. It <Col N="657" /> has been a disaster in County Mayo where, according to its annual report &ndash; I do not know how any Government could allow this to continue &ndash; 117 jobs were lost and 114 created in 1998. Is that not a great record? Údarás may be working in Galway, Donegal and Kerry but it is not working in County Mayo. The people want this talking shop brought to an end. I am not an Irish speaker but if the elections go ahead in November I will give serious consideration to throwing my own name into the hat and I will stir things up within the board. What has been happening in recent years is outrageous.</P>
    <P>There have been further job losses recently in north Mayo. It took three or four weeks to call a meeting of the board to discuss Norsk Hydro, the company established many years ago by Myles Staunton with his own money. The executives within Údarás who have not created one job know that no matter what they do Monday to Friday their cheque will be in the post, yet these are the people who will decide whether we should invest. Why did it take so long to call a board meeting which had been called for at public meetings? We are talking about an asset on which over £20 million has been spent, including about £1 million by Údarás. I am open to correction but it is my understanding that Údarás received £500,000 to £600,00 from the Norwegian company. It should have purchased this asset for future development. Could it not see the sense in this? Instead a man from County Cavan who has no intention of creating one job in County Mayo will benefit from the money invested by it, Myles Staunton, and the Norwegians. I do not know what he paid for it, he may have secured it for £200,000 or £300,000 but it would have been worth spending a further £300,000 or £400,000 on top of the £500,000 or £600,000 Údarás had already received to acquire this asset, even if it was never reopened as a going concern. That is why I have lost confidence in the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State replied to me this week about a development in Carrowtigue which I hope goes ahead. A sum of £400,000 has been committed to it. Workers in north Mayo were given the runaround by Údaras when it was announced that an American company was to open in Belmullet. After training had been provided by FÁS the project was lost. I have no problem with this but what I do have a problem with is leading people up the garden path when there are no jobs available. Members of the board &ndash; I like to call it the Údarás club &ndash; like to make major announcements but I did not see many of them rush out to make this wonderful statement &ndash; 117 jobs lost and 114 created in 1998. That is why I have lost faith in the board.</P>
    <P>I have also lost faith in the IDA which should be renamed Dublin Aid. If I was Minister of State I would be calling on the Government to get rid of Údarás and the Leader companies and establish a company similar to Shannon Development in an effort to attract jobs to the west. It should also have responsibility for infrastructure. Is it <Col N="658" /> any wonder that developers will not locate in the county given the lack of a national primary road between Longford and Charlestown, not to mention the condition of Gaeltacht roads? Dublin is chock-a-block with traffic and is now getting a third and fourth run at Structural Funds, particularly for road development.</P>

      <P>We have been listening to the Minister of State for two years; I am only asking for ten minutes. The Minister of State and Gaelgeoirs have an exclusive television station &ndash; TG4, the little club for the boys who can speak the Gaeilge &ndash; and they should now give me my opportunity. Those who cannot speak the Gaeilge do not get an opportunity either when it comes to the political programme, &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; which should be renamed &ldquo;The Week in Dublin Politics&rdquo; which is recorded on a Friday when we are not here.</P>
      <P>There are four or five hours available on TG4 every day. I am asking the Minister of State to see that this time is licensed to interested parties such as local radio. This time should be made available for local communities in Mayo, Galway and Donegal so we can have local television. We are not going to depend any longer on RTE because it does not give coverage to the west as it should. Thank God for local radio. RTE made that mistake once and it has made it with television. If it was any good it would have regional stations so that the west would have its own programmes and there would be a national news. However, RTE was not thinking ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> I welcome TG4 and I have no problem with &ldquo;the Gaeilge&rdquo;. However, there must be fair play. The four or five hours should be made available so that interested parties can apply for licences. There is nothing wrong with that and the Minister of State and the Department should investigate this possibility as it makes sense. This would restore fair play to the system so that there would be an Irish language station for the exclusive club and an English language service where we would get an opportunity to reply.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister of State to intervene as regards the Údarás and the hydro plant. I am calling on the board and the chief executive of the Údarás to immediately begin negotiations with the individual who bought the plant to ensure that the plant returns to the ownership of the Údarás. They have failed in their duty and they will not get away with it. The property should become an asset in the ownership of the Údarás which should give it six or eight months to see if it can persuade someone to come in and keep the jobs. Myles Staunton has put 20 years into this. He brought in the Norwegian company and anyone who ever came. The Údarás did not act democratically over the past few months. The board should be called together and should reverse the decision made earlier this year. It should make a positive decision to enter negotiations with the individual from Cavan who bought the plant to see if it can attract people to return to north Mayo to complete the project. It is almost there and I do not see why the extra effort cannot be made. If it fails then so be it &ndash; one has an asset that is worth millions of pounds. That is preferable to a situation in which someone buys a State asset in north Mayo for half nothing and walks away.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Mayo will have two representatives on the board, Kerry will have two and Galway will have six. The Minister of State will have a strong base for the next election. He will have a couple of councillors supporting him. I am considering running for the Údarás. Many people in my constituency feel that it needs a shake up. I did not agree with Deputy Sargent as regards the letter he sent, but I agree with his statements that we should have a bilingual service in the House. I should be able to listen to what other speakers said.</P>

The Minister of State should consider postponing the elections. The Údarás has failed Mayo, and the people in the Gaeltacht areas in the county will be waiting for the representatives. They cannot see the Celtic tiger and feel that those on the board for the past number of years have not been Celtic tigers but Celtic lambs. These representatives have been walked upon by officials and the board. It is time we had a strong voice and I may decide to run. If I do, there will be changes on the board.</P>

Cén fáth nach bhfuil Cathaoirleach an bhoird á thoghadh freisin?

Ar fhéach an tAire Stáit ar an gceist seo agus cad atá ar intinn aige a dhéanamh faoi? Ní dúirt sé aon rud faoi fós.</P>
      <P>It is a mistake to discriminate against democratically elected members. If members are to be democratically elected then I do not see why the Minister of the day should impose an unelected chairperson onto the board. This is paramount to a vote of no confidence in the elected members. It is giving a democratic status to the board with one hand and taking it away with the other. I do not object to the Minister having the right to appoint three members, in addition to the 17 elected members, but the members should be allowed to select the chairperson from their membership.</P>
      <P>It is sufficient for the Department to appoint the chief executive who, I presume, attends board meetings and is in daily contact with the Department. This liaison should be enough without giving the Minister the right to appoint the chairperson. The boards have been well able to look after their affairs in recent years and there is now the added safeguard that members' mandates expire every four and a half to five and a half years. This means that the people will have the right to decide whether the board has been doing a good job every five years. The system of electing the board should be fully democratic so that the chairperson is also elected. This is the case in local authorities where the boards elect the chairman at the first meeting after the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 4 of the Bill will the Údarás be in a position to apply directly to the EU for funding for the projects within its administrative area? This is not clear from the Bill. Will the Údarás then have responsibility for spending the grants without recourse to central Government? This is a crucial issue as I am sceptical of the interests of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, particularly in the west and in Gael<Col N="661" /> tacht areas, most of which are in the west. For example, £3.6 billion was allocated in grants in the current phase of Structural Funds to the 13 eastern and southern counties. However, only £1.6 billion was allocated for the 13 western, Border and Midland counties. The bias is clearly against the west. What powers will section 4 give the Údarás as regards direct applications for EU funding and direct spending of those funds.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the proposed closure of the saw mill in Cong. The Minister of State is more familiar with this problem than I am but what has the Údarás board done to save the plant which is in a area of low population and employment? I am also anxious to know what additional powers the Bill gives Údarás na Gaeltachta in terms of co-operating in projects with local authorities, namely, the county council in our case and maybe the borough council given that a large part of the population of the Údarás electoral area is within the borough council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court finding of 31 August 1999, rejected by nurses, includes among other elements: (a) increases of 10 per cent for ward <Col N="662" /> sister and other higher grades; (b) significant improvements in annual leave, namely, an extra three days for staff nurses and an extra four days for promotional grades; and (c) a lump sum of £1,250 for all nurses contingent upon acceptance of the recommendation. When the latest Labour Court finding is implemented, the maximum salary of ward sisters will have increased by more than 37 per cent inclusive of general and special increases since before the 1997 settlement. The maximum pay of staff nurses has increased over the same period by almost 26 per cent. Many staff nurses and a significant number of ward sisters also stand to benefit from substantial increases in location and specialist qualification allowances recommended by the court in February 1999.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court's finding represented the culmination of a lengthy negotiating process on nurses pay and conditions that has taken four years to complete. The court itself acknowledged that over the past two years nurses have justifiably improved their position not just financially but in terms of gaining recognition for the enhanced role of the profession.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to reiterate that the Government is committed to paying the full terms of the Labour Court finding and as far as the Government is concerned that offer remains on the table. However, there is no possibility of improving upon the terms of the Labour Court finding. The Government also remains fully committed to implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing which are designed to tackle the underlying problems within the profession and develop nursing and midwifery as a key profession within the health services.</P>
    <P>Once again, I ask all nurses to reflect and consider the full implications before voting for strike action. Not only would such action be in direct breach of the industrial peace clause of Partnership 2000, it would endanger the entire national partnership approach which has served the country so well and above all it would inflict considerable hardship on patients and their families.</P>
    <P>Last week the Taoiseach outlined a credible alternative to confrontation and a way forward that will provide a better outcome for all. That alternative is renewal of our commitment at national level to social partnership and a series of practical steps to a new partnership agreement. That national position must be combined with an approach to public service pay which is imaginative in ensuring that the income of public servants more closely reflects their performance and is not based on so-called traditional relativities. This is the context within which the aims and aspirations of public servants, including nurses, can best be met. However, if nurses vote for industrial action there is no avenue open to me to avert such action. All avenues have in fact been exhausted. In 1997 the Labour Court intervened to avert industrial action but on this occasion nurses have rejected the Labour Court finding.</P>
    <P>Experience with regard to the full implications <Col N="663" /> of a national nurses' strike is not available. The full range of health services is likely to be affected, including acute hospital services, community services such as nursing in the home, geriatric and long-stay hospital care. The extent to which the effects could be minimised will depend on agreement on the nature and extent of emergency cover. The Health Service Employers Agency will meet the alliance of nursing unions today to discuss the broad approach to ensuring that emergency and essential services will be maintained for the duration of the threatened strike. Management in all health agencies is currently drawing up detailed contingency plans for its own organisations. These will continue to be refined on the basis of discussions which will be held with local strike committees.</P>
    <P>My Department is in direct contact with all the affected agencies and is identifying, in association with the HSEA, all the high risk areas within the health service. Eight regional centres are being established to provide an ongoing flow of information on a daily basis to the Department in relation to service disruption and to deal with communications with patients, impending patients and their families. A co-ordinated media information campaign in relation to the impact of the strike on the provision of services is being prepared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a nurses' strike would be a disaster for both our hospital services and our community services? Does he agree that it will exacerbate the waiting lists crisis that he is presiding over? Does he accept that nurses' pay should in reality be related to pay scales of other people working in the medical and treatment areas, and that the relativity arrangements between nurses' pay and the pay of others have long since ceased to be relevant to the real skills of nurses; that they are locked into a relativity system which dates back between 20 and 30 years and that a new system is necessary? Will the Minister indicate whether the Government is willing to take any steps to seek to avoid a strike so that nurses are not put in a position they do not wish to be in? Will he acknowledge that the confrontational style he has adopted on this issue to date is making a difficult situation a great deal worse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not involved in any confrontational style. The Government has met its commitments and has entered into the agreed procedures recognised by everybody in industrial relations as the means by which matters can be resolved. We have honoured those commitments and abided by those procedures. We have gone to independent arbitration and accepted the outcome within 24 hours and said we would honour the Labour Court recommendation. Does the Deputy believe in independent arbitration? The Deputy is giving false hope to people by suggesting there is a means by which issues can be <Col N="664" /> resolved without any reference to the pay determination systems in existence. If the Deputy believes that, he is either naive or totally ignorant of the way the system works. Many trade union representatives have stated that this cannot be regarded as a stand alone issue. In fact the trade union movement has shown admirable restraint given that this claim has emerged under a 5.5 per cent restructuring claim under the PCW which has allowed for the special position of nurses to be recognised and, as the Labour Court said, to be justifiably recognised by reason of the fact that a 24 per cent increase is available should the finding of the court be accepted by nurses.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will have to face some realities. Is he in favour of independent arbitration? That is the simple question. All other issues are subjective matters. The justification of a claim one way or another can only be resolved in the context of independent arbitration. The Labour Court, under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, has that authority. The Government is honouring it and committed to it. It is also committed to implementing the report of the commission on nursing and to implementing all of its obligations under the established industrial relations procedures. What more is the Government to do if it wants to maintain &ndash; as I presume others Members wish to maintain &ndash; the social partnership which has been the cornerstone of some of our economic success? That is the position. Rather than the Deputy facing two ways at the same time I ask him to be straight and honest with people and not suggest a solution can be found under the current pay determination systems when that is clearly not the case. We have traditional relativities and we have an analogue system. For 15 months the Taoiseach has been engaged with the social partners about how we can devise a new system. Given that the Deputy believes we should have a new system, would he not think it more constructive or realistic to ask everybody involved in the public sector to try to devise a new system which will recognise enhanced performance and responsibility? Clearly it cannot be resolved in the context of the current parameters in which we operate in relation to public sector pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that while he has a duty to maintain current industrial relations structures, his primary concern surely must be to protect patients? Does he accept that when there is a rejection by 95 per cent of nurses, no matter how good the system is, it simply is not good enough when we are now facing a nurses' strike for the first time? Notwithstanding what he says, does he accept that a deal will have to be struck? The only question whether the deal will be struck before the nurses go out on strike or after. Does the Minister accept that there is widespread support for the nurses from their medical colleagues and the public? There is an onus on the Minister to reach beyond the standard answer he has given to the House and produce some for<Col N="665" /> mula which allows for the concerns of nurses to be addressed &ndash; we all recognise that for too long nurses were undervalued, and no Government is exonerated on that score. That requires of the Minister an additional effort to ensure that we do not simply have a head to head confrontation. Surely the Minister will accept that his statements so far have been less than helpful in recognising the unprecedented crisis we are facing in our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask in what specific case has anything I have said been unhelpful in relation to the situation. The Government is making the position on this matter abundantly clear, before people take certain decisions, and it is incumbent on us to communicate that position to all concerned, including nurses. It will not be a case of making that position clear after a strike ballot has been taken. It is incumbent on Government, given the seriousness of the situation, to make clear the position. Again, I put it to those asking questions, are the other parties in the House in favour of social partnership? Are they in favour of allowing a situation to develop where public service special claims will emerge as a result of handling this matter in a particular way? If that is their position, they should come out and say so. Let us not have the political dishonesty that on the one hand the Deputy claims to hold a brief for the nurses on this matter and on the other remains silent on the question of whether social partnership should be upheld. Those are the facts of the matter.</P>
      <P>Do those on the Opposition benches believe in independent arbitration? That is the question. The Government has honoured its commitments in relation to procedures, processes and acceptance of the authority of the Labour Court in this matter. The other parties have not done so. Given, as Deputy McManus indicated, the prospect of services being affected across the board in the event of an all out nurses strike, which has never happened before, is it not the case that people have to face up to the implications of that?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the revelations from the Baby A case show that persons involved in the Adams counselling agency behaved with gross and appalling violation of trust of young vulnerable women who were seeking advice and counselling in the context of their pregnancies? Does the Minister agree that there is a need to ensure there can never again be a repetition of the events depicted in the Baby A case which not simply related to the baby who was the subject of the proceedings in the High Court but gave an insight into other difficulties which had arisen with this agency? Will the Minister acknowledge it is bizarre and illogical that there is currently no legal framework in place to prevent a person convicted &ndash; I am not saying this applies to the Adams agency &ndash; of a sexual offence, on leaving Arbour Hill or Mountjoy Prison, from placing an advertisement in the <i>Golden Pages</i> announcing that he is providing counselling to pregnant women or victims of sexual abuse? Will the Minister acknowledge that he has an obligation to the public to put in place now an appropriate regulatory framework?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy's sentiments in regard to the case to which he referred. While there is no legislation governing counselling services provided by professionals under health boards, those people are subject to regulatory regimes and guidelines operated by their respective professional bodies. Health boards are <Col N="667" /> currently devising a model for the uniform provision of counselling services across all health boards. Preliminary inquiries focused on countries within the EU, in terms of the review I have undertaken, indicate that there is no regulatory regime in place in those countries. Information is awaited from Sweden, but it has already been established that it does not have a statutory framework of regulation.</P>
      <P>I intend to see how we can address this issue without driving out those who provide a good quality service and causing a deterioration in the overall position. I take the view that the cases which have come to light in recent times require that this matter be put under immediate review.</P>

      <P>Trainee doctors, along with several other groups, were excluded from the provisions of the original Working Time Directive adopted by the EU in 1993. Following adoption of the 1993 directive the European Commission embarked on a consultative exercise with the sectors concerned and the member states on how a broadly similar level of protection to that provided by the 1993 directive, could be afforded to the excluded groups while taking account of the specific requirements of the industries and services concerned. In the case of hospitals this involved attempting to balance the need for reasonable working hours for doctors while recognising the 24 hour nature of hospital services and the need to guarantee continuity of care for patients. In Ireland's case we needed a framework which would allow us to move from our present position of having a maximum working week of 65 hours for junior doctors to the 48 hours contained in the 1993 directive. My Department has been concerned to achieve this in a manner which would not endanger patients and which would not throw the entire medical workforce career structure into chaos by recruiting large numbers of trainee doctors for whom there would be no reasonable prospect of securing career posts. The future structure of the hospital medical staffing is already being looked at by the Medical Manpower Forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Commission published its proposals for an amending directive to the 1993 directive in November 1998. The Commission's proposals have been the subject of discussion in a social questions working group under the aegis of the Labour and Social Affairs Council. A significant number of the member states felt that the Commission's proposals were impractical and could not be implemented in the timescale proposed. The German Presidency then had to work on compromise proposals which might be acceptable to a majority of the member states. These <Col N="669" /> proposals involved a total transition period of 12 years with a gradual reduction in maximum weekly working hours to 48 hours over the period. The United Kingdom proposed a 13 year transition period to reach the objective. In the interests of securing unanimity at the Council this proposal was accepted.</P>
    <P>We have progressively reduced hospital doctors' working hours over the years. It is the responsibility of local hospital management to roster non-consultant hospital doctors taking into account the nature of the clinical service to be provided. The basic working week of all NCHDs is 39 hours. However, they are liable to be rostered to work up to an average of 65 hours per week. The 65 hour week was implemented in 1989 following a Labour Court recommendation and in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation which represents the interests of NCHDs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>
      </i>A mechanism has been introduced to monitor and control the working hours of NCHDs as part of the revised terms and conditions of the NCHD contract of employment and the complete four stage mechanism, to resolve any breach of the Labour Court recommendation has been in place since 1 January 1997. I am not aware that there has been any use made of this mechanism to date.</P>
    <P>The 65 hour week was introduced in 1989-90 at considerable cost resulting in the recruitment at the time of over 400 additional non-consultant hospital doctors. The number of junior doctors has continued to grow since then. This growth has resulted in a serious imbalance between the number of these trainee posts and the number of consultant posts. I established the Medical Manpower Forum to address this and associated medical manpower issues. The forum is taking full account of the need to reduce working hours in its deliberations. However, we have to be realistic in how we approach this complex problem. What we have sought from these negotiations is a practical framework to implement the 48 hour week. I believe that we now have a set of proposals which will allow us to reduce doctors' hours in an orderly and progressive fashion without affecting patients or jeopardising standards of patient care.</P>
    <P>What was agreed at the Council meeting on 25 May 1999 is now being considered by the European Parliament. The eventual final content of the directive is a matter for negotiation between the Council and the Parliament. I do not believe that we need to await the final outcome of the EU's deliberations on the draft directive to begin to put in place the preparatory process required to implement the primary provisions of the legislation. In that regard it is necessary to establish the facts on the ground. Accordingly, it has been agreed between representatives from my Department, the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation that a study should be undertaken which would look at the hours worked by NCHDs. The study will be over<Col N="670" /> seen by a joint steering group. The steering group will be chaired by Mr. David Hanly, a former chairman of Comhairle na nOspidéal. When the findings of the study and the outcome of the Medical Manpower Forum's deliberations are available, it is intended to reach agreement on how to reduce NCHD working hours in a manner that benefits doctors and patients.</P>

Will he accept there is a great and urgent need to enter into arrangements which substantially reduce the hours NCHDs have to work and that where they work overtime they are properly paid for it?</P>

There may well be some interim proposals, before the study is completed in the middle of 2000, early next year.

      <P>Since 1997, my Department has been working with health agencies to ensure year 2000 compliance in the health service. My Department has undertaken an overall role of co-ordinating, assisting and facilitating the sharing of information and monitoring progress. Each health agency has its own year 2000 project structure in place and the year 2000 remediation programme is now drawing to a close. To date, I have authorised expenditure amounting to approximately £25 million for the repair or replacement of non-compliant systems and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, agencies are completing the technical aspects of their compliance programmes and I am confident that all necessary work will be completed in good time. However, best practices in this field also demand the development and testing of contingency plans as an added guarantee. Accordingly, agencies are in the process of developing and testing comprehensive contin<Col N="672" /> gency plans, which will be put into effect in the event of a problem arising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services. Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health <Col N="673" /> board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification, the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person. Some 2,481 such inspections have taken place to date. Where breaches of the regulations are identified following inspection, health boards can bring the matter to the attention of the District Court under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board brought a prosecution against one provider who was obliged by the court to cease operating her service for a period of 60 days. All health boards report that they are aware that a number of pre-school service providers have closed their service voluntarily either before or after inspection as they are aware that they fall short of the standards required by the regulations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, examined the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a child care infrastructure, including the financing and resourcing implications of its implementation. The report of the group was launched on 3 February 1999. The Government established an interdepartmental committee on child care chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report and the child care proposals in the Action Programme for the Millennium, the Report of the Commission on the Family and the Report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education. The report of the committee has been noted by the Government which has referred the report for consideration to a ministerial group. The Deputy will appreciate that, having regard to my responsibilities, the health, safety and welfare of children must be my primary consideration.</P>

How many nursery places is the Department funding at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information as it is a separate question. The latest information available from the health boards shows that 1,864 places have been reduced arising from the inspection process. The requirement to reduce places is mainly related to the availability of adequate space per child in the premises and/or the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children <Col N="674" /> in the service at all times. When I inquired about that statistic I was told it represents approximately 4 per cent of the total places notified, which stands at 44,686.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for those figures. I am sure he would agree that 1,864 places is a huge number. What proposals does he have to replace those places which have been lost? I am not denying that inspections are important and it is essential we have standards but it is equally essential that the Government provides funding to ensure that a proper pre-school service can be provided and that it is financially viable. It is difficult to know who is responsible. Recently the Minister for Education and Science said he was responsible for pre-school services yet he is putting little money into them. Is it the Minister's intention to accept any responsibility for the provision of pre-school services and to provide funding this year?</P>

      <P>The initial analysis shows that in a small number of hospitals it has not been possible to date to fully implement the Patients' Charter guidelines regarding out-patient appointment times due to logistical and other factors. However, these hospitals have confirmed they are currently reviewing their practices with a view to offering individual appointment times. The survey also indicates that some hospitals offer appointments on a staggered basis with the interval between appointments set in line with the requirements of the individual clinics and experience has shown that this is the most effective way of operating these clinics. Once again, the hospitals have indicated that they are keeping this practice under review to ensure that patient interest is served. In addition, some hospitals are currently carrying out individual patient satisfaction surveys and the specific issue of out-patient appointments is being examined in this context. As I indicated to the Deputy in June 1999, once my Department's analysis on this issue is complete, I will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the provisions of the charter are being met.</P>
      <P>The development of mechanisms for improvements in patient advocacy is an important task for my Department and, in this regard, my objective is to provide a patient focused service within which the priority must be equity of access to high quality of care based on clinical need. The Patients' Charter was an important step in developing awareness of patient's rights and I intend to develop a comprehensive policy which will build on the good standards of practice which the charter provides.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister in a position to indicate to the House the hospitals which are not to date complying with the Patients' Charter and when they will start complying in the context of arranging specific appointments for out-patients? Does he agree it is unfair to keep patients waiting for hours for appointments and to give 30 or 40 patients the same time for an appointment when there is no possibility of most of them who turn up being seen for a long time after they arrive?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this is not satisfactory. Many of us would have received complaints from constituents in that regard. The initial analysis shows that 5 per cent of hospitals surveyed offer no individual appointment times, 32 per cent stagger appointments in line with the requirements of the clinic and 63 per cent offer individual appointments. In the case of those which do not have individual appointment times, the survey indicates that existing practices are now under review. There might be some improvement now that we are pushing this issue. When the analysis is complete, I will communicate with the interested parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is unsatisfactory that 37 per cent or over one-third of our hospitals are not implementing the Patients' Charter many years after it was put in place? Does he agree that this issue should have been monitored on an ongoing basis by his Department to ensure the Patients' Charter was complied with? It should not require prompting by way of parliamentary questions from this side. Will the Minister acknowledge that without parliamentary questions being tabled about this issue, the current unsatisfactory position would have continued?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the position, I would applaud the Opposition for doing something constructive. That is not a problem. In most cases the practice of staggered appointment times is working well but some hospitals indicated that they were reviewing the arrangement to ensure they could meet each patient's needs. The staggered appointment times do not necessarily mean that patients are being put to any great inconvenience if the staggering is, as the Deputy said, realistic and 50 people are not there for the same time, which is a nonsense. The initial analysis is the information I gave to the Deputy earlier. When the analysis is complete, more information and lessons can be learned.</P>

I have brought this to the attention of the management.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board area are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service. A consultant-led service ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>Is the question being taken with another question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies. It is being taken with Question No. 53.</P>
      <P>Due to the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition. Children are assessed, therefore, in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped.</P>
      <P>Following the appointment by the board of a consultant orthodontist in September 1996, a regional orthodontic unit, appropriately staffed and equipped, was established by the board on the campus of St. James's Hospital. A number of dentists with appropriate support staff were assigned to work in orthodontics under the direction, training and supervision of the consultant. Using this combined approach it has been possible to treat a large number of patients under the supervision of the consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1996 the board has made significant <Col N="678" /> inroads in orthodontic waiting lists. The category one waiting list has been reduced from 681 patients to 83 patients and the category two list from 10,676 to 7,736. My Department is currently considering submissions from the board for the development of two further regional orthodontic units, one in north Dublin and another in south east Dublin.</P>
    <P>I understand that some difficulties have been experienced at the regional orthodontic unit this year which have led to a unilateral decision by the consultant to cease the commencement of new treatments. These difficulties are of a sensitive nature and are being addressed by the board with the consultant and her representatives. The board envisages that they will be resolved in the short-term.</P>

The Eastern Health Board had considerable trouble recruiting one orthodontist, which is totally inadequate for the size of the area. I ask the Minister to start taking charge of this area which is in a mess at present. It needs radical reform and funding as a matter of urgency, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>Domiciliary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age. At present the scheme does not cover children under the age of two years since all children in that age group are regarded as requiring constant care and attention. I have examined the issue of extending the scheme to include children under two years of age with severe disabilities. As I have indicated on previous occasions, I am sympathetic to the proposal. I have instructed my officials to examine the possibility of granting such an extension sooner rather than later. As I have also indicated in Adjournment debates and previous replies, there is the question of priority expenditures. It is in this context that officials of my Department are discussing the possibility of funding being sourced in the Estimates for next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister acknowledge that a child or baby under two years of age who is disabled requires a great deal more care and attention than a baby who does not suffer a disability? The parents of babies with major disabilities require this allowance and it is both illogical and inhumane that it is not provided to them. They are frequently coping with very young <Col N="682" /> children who suffer seizures and who require particular assistance in using toilet facilities and other activities, such as eating. There is no logic in his departmental view that all children under two require similar care. In that context, does the Minister acknowledge that he has had this issue under review for a long time? Will he tell the House that provision will be made in the next budget to extend this allowance to make it available to parents of disabled children under two years of age? Does he acknowledge there is a need to extend it?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13, 26, 70, 100, 101, 108 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>The paediatric dermatology service at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, includes the provision of care for children affected by epidermolysis bullosa, or EB. The hospital has identified a need for the further development of its dermatology service, which includes the provision of continued support services for children affected by this condition, with particular emphasis on the role of the EB nurse specialist, and has submitted a proposal to my Department in this regard. The proposal is under consideration by the Department.</P>
      <P>This proposal is linked to a similar proposal from St. James's Hospital for the development of its dermatology service in terms of joint consultant appointments. The continuation of the EB nurse specialist role in particular and the further development of the dermatology service in general at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children will be the subject of discussions with the hospital in the context of its priority funding requirements for next year. However, while the Estimates process is still ongoing, I hope that funding for the specialist nurse should be available next year provided the authorities at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children consider it a development priority in the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any indication <Col N="684" /> yet as to whether the hospital considers it a service development priority? Will he ensure this service is provided as it has proved to be of great and vital importance in dealing with this very difficult illness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we have not been notified of that yet. Discussions have not taken place. They are imminent and, if the hospital confirms it is a priority, it will be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could adopt a slightly different approach to this. When he considers this matter, perhaps he could take into account that the liaison nurse provides a very important role for the parents and families of people with this condition. There is no worse condition for a child to have than this one. It is enormously distressing and destructive, physically and emotionally, not just for the victim but for the family as a whole. We are not talking about much money nor are we talking solely about a hospital programme for dealing with the condition, we are talking about people under stress, sometimes in circumstances which require daily heroism. While the Minister is taking into account the larger issues of the planning of the hospital, could the position of the nurse be guaranteed to the 200 to 300 sufferers of this condition, some of them more severe than others? I cannot imagine a worse condition than I have seen in some people suffering from this illness. Will the Minister take a specific view regarding the liaison nurse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Service developments should be agreed between the Department, hospitals and boards. It is the best way of ensuring we all work on the same track. Otherwise, one could be accused of making arbitrary decisions without reference to practice in hospitals and health boards. The process is a good one. I am sure the people in Crumlin recognise the work the EB nurse specialist does. If that is the case and given that the funding was provided for a few years up to now, I expect the Crumlin hospital will say that this is a priority development for next year. If it is, I will accommodate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the care takes place in the home and it is not always possible for a hospital with its own priorities to acknowledge and understand the circumstances within families. Perhaps the Minister could take that into account. It is not solely a hospital responsibility and the children who suffer from this condition require an enormous amount of care. They are often isolated because of the rarity of their condition. The role of the liaison nurse, while in medical terms may not be seen as the highest priority, in human terms is of absolute necessity to those families struggling to cope with what is a devastating condition.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he is taking to tackle the unacceptable waiting lists for social work services in the Eastern Health Board area; if he will provide the additional resources to ensure that children waiting for referral to a social worker due to neglect or abuse will be seen without delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards are resourced by my Department to discharge their statutory responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, and under other relevant legislation. Since taking office in 1997, the Government has allocated an additional £29.5 million in revenue funding for child care services. The £15 million allocated this year is the largest amount allocated in a single year since the Child Care Act was passed. The Eastern Health Board has received a greater than <i>pro rata </i>share of these additional resources because of the wider range of issues to which it has to respond.</P>
      <P>Resourcing decisions are made against the background of regular contacts between officials of my Department and officials of the health boards. In the case of the Eastern Health Board, the board, in discussions with my officials, has highlighted problems in recruiting and retaining staff as a constraint in providing services, but the availability of resources has not been identified as a serious constraint in this area. It is a matter for each health board to manage its services to ensure their effective and efficient delivery. I will ask the Eastern Health Board to provide information to the Deputy in regard to the detail of his query which relates to operational issues which are the responsibility of the board.</P>

      <P>The Minister recently provided that detail. Looking back at the record, it has not changed much over the past few years. Approximately 450 to 500 children are on the waiting list for referral to a social worker at any one time. Does the Minister find that acceptable? Will the Minister desist from telling us how much money he is spending and comment on the scale of the current problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why the public should not know what money we are spending. It is their money. The information supplied by the health board to us in May of this year indicated that there were 463 children on waiting lists for social work services. That contrasts with 47 cases in the remaining seven health board areas. The Eastern Health Board advised that all cases requiring an immediate response should receive it. Many of the cases on the waiting list have undergone an initial assessment and are awaiting reports from other specialist agencies. In our discussions with the Eastern Health Board on these issues, the board has indicated the difficulty of obtaining and retaining staff. That is something it has to continue to work on all the time. It has not stated <Col N="686" /> that resourcing was the core issue. If they could retain more of their staff or get more staff perhaps this list would not be as it is. The board makes the point that those who require an immediate response get it.</P>

      <P>I spent half an hour dealing with an urgent case &ndash; that is why I was late coming in today &ndash; in respect of which there was no social worker available within the Eastern Health Board. The Minister did not answer the question as to whether it is acceptable to have 500 children awaiting referral to a social work service. Perhaps if he could generate interest in that he might, in turn, be able to take some action to address the problem. The problem is not going away. It is remaining static.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the shortage of social workers, is the Minister aware that at any one time there are approximately 8 per cent of posts vacant in the social work service? Does the Minister accept that this has been an ongoing problem and there is an urgent need to take action in relation to dealing with third level colleges to ensure that there is a substantial increase in the intake of social work students so that, as services develop, social workers will be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, how that can be addressed. Obviously, the fact that there are 463 children on waiting lists in the Eastern Health Board area, as against 47 in the remaining health board areas, shows that there is a more unsatisfactory situation pertaining in the Eastern Health Board area than in other health board areas. I have explained some of the reasons given by the health board providing the service. I am also stating that the recruitment of social workers by the Eastern Health Board is an operational matter for it with which it has to deal.</P>
      <P>In relation to the wider policy area, the Deputy makes an assertion that this is something that can be resolved within the third level institutions in terms of providing more places. That is a matter I will take up with the Minister for Education and Science and revert to the Deputy on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, as Deputy Shortall said, it is unacceptable that there are this number of children awaiting social work service? Would the Minister acknowledge that the ongoing difficulties which the Eastern Health Board has given rise to a genuine concern as to the capacity of that health board to properly implement the new child abuse guidelines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions relates to the present position in that health board where there is clearly a less ideal situation than in the other seven. We have to see how we can address that issue. That is something that I, with my colleague, <Col N="687" /> will seek to do something about. I would also make the point, and the Deputies should not take exception to it, that more resources than ever before are being put into this area. Clearly resources alone are not the issue. There is the issue of recruitment and of retaining staff. That also must be addressed. It is for the Department and the Eastern Health Board to work on those problems to see how we might improve matters because, given the figures, there seems to be a very satisfactory situation in the other seven health board areas. We must learn from other health boards while acknowledging &ndash; and I do in my reply &ndash; that there is a breadth of social problems in Dublin that may not pertain to other health board areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>An unprecedented level of investment is now taking place in acute hospital facilities under the current capital programme. In line with my strategy for the development of acute hospital services on a regionally self-sufficient basis, this process of investment is aimed at developing a strong network of regional and local general hospitals. In 1999, a total of £155 million has been provided for capital investment in the health services, a significant proportion of which has been directed into the acute hospital area.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has also been made on the phased commissioning of new units completed under the capital programme. In 1999, a total of £11.5 million has been provided to meet the revenue costs associated with doing this. This is enabling major new facilities such as those completed under Phase 1 at University College Hospital, Galway and Phase 1 at the Mercy Hospital, Cork to be fully staffed and brought into service this year and has allowed significant progress to be made on the phased completion of commissioning the major developments at Limerick Regional Hospital. The further phased commissioning of units at Limerick Regional Hospital, including three remaining operating theatres, is being addressed in the context of revenue funding in 2000 and beyond. Eight theatres have been commissioned at the Adelaide and Meath Hospitals Incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, in line with the agreed service plan for the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to newly constructed theatres that have not yet been commissioned, operating theatres may be temporarily taken out of use to allow for refurbishment and maintenance works, <Col N="688" /> staff annual leave or in line with the planned scheduling of elective activity in a hospital over a 12 month period.</P>
    <P>In general terms, I am satisfied that the hospital system is delivering a satisfactory level of activity. In the first six months of 1999 overall discharges, in-patient and day cases, are up over 3.6 per cent over the same period in 1998, which itself had a record level of activity. Within this overall increase, day case work has increased by almost 12 per cent. This comes on top of an overall activity increase of 3 per cent in 1998 over 1997 levels. Allied with the reduction of 3,000 or some 8 per cent achieved on in-patient waiting list numbers in the target specialties over the first six months of this year, I am satisfied that effective use of available resources, including theatre capacity, is being made in the delivery of hospital services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that at a time when there are 34,000 patients on hospital waiting lists, this is due to a gross failure to properly use existing resources. Limerick Regional Hospital has two main operating theatres and one day theatre constructed but not in use. University College Hospital Galway has two operating theatres constructed, available since October 1998 and not in use. The new Tallaght hospital has four theatres constructed and not in use. Would the Minister not acknowledge that if those theatres were commissioned and the necessary resources provided for staffing that they would dramatically impact on the hospital waiting lists in respect of which there are far too many people waiting for essential surgery for two, three and four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to capital programmes for hospital projects, there is a need to phase in the commissioning of those units, for health safety reasons, for other reasons, and usually for revenue reasons. Therefore, when a capital project is completed at the tail end of one financial year, it may not be possible to provide the revenue in the following financial year because certain staffing levels have to be agreed, certain issues have to be decided upon and, in the following financial year one usually finds that they come into commission. In relation to commissioning units, the amount of money being spent by this Government is three times what was spent by my predecessor. One of the reasons for that is that we have a much enhanced capital programme and we have more places to open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that there were particular problems in relation to the Tallaght hospital and that a consultancy study pointed out that there could be no question of further public moneys being given to Tallaght in terms of providing more services until we had established a capacity within that hospital to deal with the existing level of service for which it was given money last year. Thankfully, as a result of actions taken by me in appointing three people to go in <Col N="689" /> and assist the board and management in relation to that matter, we have greatly stabilised the situation in Tallaght hospital. I have indicated that, upon that troika confirming to me that we now have established a competence capacity in that hospital, I am prepared to look at proceeding with the phased commissioning of further units at Tallaght as agreed and as set out in a Department of Health letter from my predecessor in 1996 &ndash; I understand the Deputy was supportive of the position at the time. If the Deputy wants to change tack now, I am telling him that he should develop some consistency in his approach. While availability of those theatres would, obviously, be helpful, it is not true to say they would have a dramatic impact on the overall waiting list figure, which is a function of 4 per cent of the total activity per year in our hospital system. That is not correct. It would obviously be of assistance and some work would be done, but to suggest that is the panacea that will solve the problem shows a pretty naive understanding of how hospitals work.</P>

      <P>I can see from the Minister of State's reply why the elderly people who have served this State so well find themselves in this situation in their hour of need, particularly those in institutions. No inspectorate has been appointed since the report was published. This report was left in the Minister of State's Department for 12 months before it was even looked at. Nothing has been done since I raised this in the Dáil a number of months ago. I am very disappointed with the Minister. When does he expect to put an inspectorate in place, so that all public institutions can be inspected on a regular basis? Or is there no regard for the elderly?</P>

      <P>I disagree with the sentiments <Col N="691" /> expressed by the Deputy. In fact, more has been done in the past two years for the elderly than for quite some time before that. Naturally, there was something of a delay. In September 1998 the Department requested the national council to arrange for the publication of this study. Unfortunately, the council was not at full strength at that time. Subsequently, around December, a chairman was appointed and the council was brought up to full strength. Since then, it has considered it on a number of occasions. As the Deputy can see, a working party has been set up which will report to me in due course. If it decides that an inspectorate is necessary, that will be done with due consultation. However, we should wait to see what the working group chaired by Dr. O'Neill has to say on the whole issue.</P>

      <P>According to the report, over 1,200 people have been abused. If they were children or in another country, every Member of this House would ask the Taoiseach and the Ceann Comhairle on the Order of Business every day what was being done about it. According to a recent report, 1,200 elderly people were found to have been mistreated. The Minister and the Government have done nothing about this. He tells us today that&mdash;</P>

    <P>With regard to individual hospitals' catchment areas, each of the major Dublin acute hospitals provides a local service to its immediate hinterland. However, referral is a matter for the general practitioner in the first instance, exercising his/her clinical judgment on the hospital of choice. In addition, many of the hospitals in the Dublin area provide both regional and national specialties, and referrals to these specialties from outside the Dublin area are a significant feature of their activities.</P>

    <P>With regard to population growth areas of the city and the impact of demographic changes on the health services, individual health service providers take these changes into account when formulating development proposals and service plans on a yearly basis.

I would anticipate that the ERHA's public health department will include this in its analysis of need factors such as those identified by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I wish to raise a matter with you, Sir. Yesterday evening, written replies to questions to the Minister for Health and Children were not supplied to Deputies until after 7 p.m.. I wish to draw to your attention, Sir, in order to protect the rights of Deputies, that, as of 2 p.m. today, some of the answers to those questions were incomplete and not in legible form. As of two o'clock today some of the answers to the questions were incomplete and illegible. It is a rule of the House that answers to written questions should be furnished by approximately 4.30 p.m. that day. I have drawn the attention of the House to this difficulty in the past. The Department of Health and Children is the only Department with which this difficulty regularly arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister, not in a spirit of confrontation, to ensure that the replies to the remaining questions on today's Order Paper are furnished to the General Office by 4.30 p.m. and not at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. and that they are in legible form <Col N="694" /> and do not consist of badly photocopied documents.</P>

That was my fault and I, rather than the Department, take responsibility for that.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an údarás ar son an Chomhaontais Ghlas as ucht an obair atá déanta acu le fiche bliain anuas. Tugann sé níos mó cumhachta don údarás agus níos lú cumhachtaí don Aire agus ar an ábhar sin ba chóir go n-eireodh go geal le hobair an údaráis amach anseo. Tuigim mar a thuigeann gach duine sa Teach seo atá ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn go mbíonn an-bhrú ar an údarás an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus bíodh a fhios ag an údarás go bhfuil daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ag guí gach rath orthu agus sásta pé tacaíocht is gá a thabhairt chun na haidhmeanna sin a bhaint amach.</P>
      <P>Cé go bhfuil cónaí ormsa i mBaile Brigín, mar a raibh coláiste samhraidh Gaeilge tráth, ní Gaeltacht é an baile ach gach uair a théim siar ó Ghaillimh feicim oifigí an údaráis mar chineál geata go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus tá mé ag súil go mbeidh na foirgnimh sin mar chuid lárnach den Ghaeltacht seachas mar gheata chuige agus go mbeidh an Ghaeltacht ag dul i méid. Sin an aisling phearsanta agus tá súil agam go bhfuil an cuspóir céanna ag an údarás.</P>
      <P>Luaigh an tAire Stáit roinnt maith rudaí ina óráid agus ba mhaith liom tagairt do na háiteanna iargúlta ar leathanach 3 áit is dúshlán mór é don údarás forbairt a ghiniúint agus a dháileadh sna ceantair bheaga nár ghnóthaigh a gcion féin fós den bhorradh eacnamaíochta a tharla le cúpla bliain anuas. Is cuid tábhachtach é sin de chuspóirí an údaráis agus tá cuid mhaith le déanamh maidir leis fós, mar a léirigh Teachtaí éagsúla ón iarthar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> Is fiú féachaint ar an bhfocal iargúlta i gcomhthéacs an Stáit seo. Focal é nach ritheann le ciall do dhaoine atá an-ghníomhach agus an-éifeachtach ina gceantair féin. Ní bhreathnaíonn siad orthu féin mar cheantar iargúlta  &ndash; b'fhéidir go mbreathnaíonn siad ar cheantair eile mar cheantair iargúlta! Ach is trua go bhfuil an Stát seo chomh lárnaithe is atá sé agus cuireann sé an-bhrú ar Ghaeltachtaí nuair atá saol eacnamaíochta na tíre lonnaithe ar an gcóste thoir nach mór. Pobal Ráth Cairn amháin atá in ann a bheith ag brath ar shaol Gaeilge Bhaile Átha Cliath. Taobh amuigh de sin ba chóir go mbeadh an t-údarás ag labhairt amach faoi dhílárú na tíre agus ag iarraidh brú a chur ar an Rialtas dá réir.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir gurb é seo an abairt ba thábhachtaí in óraid an Aire Stáit maidir le fealsúnacht an údaráis nuair a dúirt sé go gcaithfidh an t-údarás an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt mar áit ina mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga ag an bpobal. Agus dúirt sé ansin, is chuige sin atá an t-údarás ann. Glacaim go hiomlá leis sin.</P>
    <P>Glacaim leis freisin go bhfuil geallúintí chomhchlár an Rialtais fós le comhlíonadh. Tá tagairt ann do chomhchlár Rialtais Fhianna Fáil agus an Pháirtí Daonlathaigh á rá go mbainfear lánúsáid as acmhainní an údaráis chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. Anois is éasca an rud é sin a rá. Ach bheadh cúpla leasuithe le déanamh chun é sin a chur i ngníomh agus ní ball mé don chomhchoiste a bheidh ag plé leis an mBille seo. Ba bhreá liom na leasuithe seo a mholadh don chomhchoiste agus don Aire ach go háirithe.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom leasú a mholadh a dhéanfadh tagairt don slí inar féidir le lucht forbartha nó comhairlí contae nó éinne a bhfuil an t-airgead acu chuige, áiteanna a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht gan chomhairle ó thaobh na Gaeilge nó ó thaobh an chultúir a lorg ón údarás. Is féidir a bheith ag caint ar cheantar Chonamara i gcoitinne, áit a bhfuil cur amach níos fearr ag an Aire Stáit air ná mar atá agamsa. Fós tugaim faoi deara in Éirinn i gcoitinne, go bhfuil a lán foirgneamh agus bóithre á thógáil i láthair na huaire agus is gá rud a thugtar environmental impact statement a fháil ina dtaobh agus tá cúrsaí comhshaoil níos fearr as dá bharr, tá súil againn.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh na Gaeilge de, agus is cuid de chúrsaí comhshaoil na hÉireann í an Ghaeilge ní gá go fóill aon staidéar den tsórt seo a fháil ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Is féidir ocht dteach déag a thógáil sa Spidéal, a bheidh an-chostasach don duine a cheannóidh iad, agus is féidir le daoine a theacht isteach sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Níl á rá agam ach go bhfuil fadhb ann. Tuigeann an tAire Stáit go bhfuil agus ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé de chumhacht ag an <Col N="697" /> údarás a rá le daoine atá ag teacht isteach sa Ghaeltacht go gcaithfidh siad dul chun cainte leo siúd maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus saol cultúrtha na Gaeltachta. Má tá ollmhargadh le teacht isteach in Indreabhán nó in áit ar bith eile sa Ghaeltacht ba cheart go mbeadh sé de dhualgas orthu labhairt leis an údarás agus tuiscint a fháil ar chúrsaí chur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Tá mise ag fanacht leis an lá a bheidh multiplex nó rud mar é á thógáil i gConamara agus gurb é sin an rud is mó a bheidh sa cheantar. Ní dóigh liom go mairfeadh an Ghaeilge i bhfad i ndiaidh do rud mar sin a theacht.</P>
      <P>Maidir le comharthaí bóthair agus mar sin de tá Gaeilge in úsáid sa Ghaeltacht don chuid is mó ach ní go hiomlán.</P>
      <P>Nuair a luaigh an tAire Stáit go mbeadh 20 chomhalta ar an bhord nua bhraith mé ó thaobh an Chomhaontais Ghlais de go bhfuil sé an-deacair cruinniú a reáchtáil le fiche. Ach tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil lucht na Gaeltachta níos eagraithe ná lucht an Bhéarla.</P>
      <P>Ba bhreá a mholadh go mbainfí níos mó úsáide as teleconferencing mar a dhéantar sa Chomhaontas Glas. Bíonn baill againne atá ina gcónaí i gCiarraí agus mar sin de páirteach i gcruinnithe gach seachtain leis an trealamh seo. Ní dóigh gur leasú a bheadh ag teastáil chuige seo ach athrú cleachtaidh.</P>
      <P>Sin óráid luadh go raibh deireadh á chur leis an bhforáil cead an Aire a lorg do thograí. Fáiltím roimh an athraithe sin. Is laghdú é ar chumhacht an Aire ach tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh an t&ndash;</P>
      <P>údarás in ann rudaí a shocrú agus a phlé dóibh féin. Is chuige sin atá na toghcháin.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na toghcháin, níl aon tuairim láidir agamsa faoin am den bhliain is fearr do thoghchán. Ach is cuimhin liom nuair a bhí toghchán againn i 1992 go raibh an-chuid de na daoine a bhí ag vótáíl míshásta go raibh daoine ag bualadh ar an doras sa dorchadas. B'fhéidir gurbh fhiú machnamh a dhéanamh ar sin agus dáta eile a shocrú.</P>
      <P>Chuala mé duine ó Thír Chonaill a bheadh ag seasamh don údarás ag rá le déanaí go mba cheart go mbeadh níos mó cumhachta ag an IDA sa Ghaeltacht agus feicim san óráid go mbíonn an IDA páirteach tríd is tríd in obair an údaráis ar aon chuma. Níl a fhios agam an raibh sé míshástá nach raibh an t-údarás chomh gníomhach is a ba cheart dóibh a bheith ina cheantar féin nó an raibh sé dáiríre sa mhéid a dúirt sé ach bheadh an Ghaeilge thíos leis dá mbeadh an IDA ann in ionad an údaráis.</P>
      <P>Rinne Teachta eile tagairt do na deontais a bhíonn ar fáil do dhaoine a labhraíonn Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus cheap sé go raibh sé míchothrom go mbeadh teaghlaigh áirithe thíos leis. Tá seans ag daoine Gaeilge a fhoghlaim má bhíonn cónaí orthu sa Ghaeltacht agus sin cuid den socrú atá ann agus is spreagadh é an deontas. Ba cheart do dhaoine iarracht a dhéanamh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim má tá siad ag cur futhu sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an údarás mar go mbíonn an-bhrú orthu ó dhaoine a bheadh ag iar<Col N="698" /> raidh monarcha a thógáil ach go mba chuma sa tsioc leo faoin Ghaeilge. Tá súil agam go dtuigfear amach go mbíonn an-éileamh ar Éireannaigh mar oibrithe de bhrí go bhfuil tuiscint acu ar níos mó na teanga amháin. Bíonn níos mó ná teanga amháin á labhairt ag níos mó ná 65% de dhaonra an domhain agus ní rud eisceachtúil é dhá theanga a labhairt. Tá súil agam gurb í an Ghaeilge a bheas in uachtar sa Ghaeltacht agus dá mbeadh seans againn a bheith ag Céim an Choiste bheinn ann. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil córas aistriúcháin ar fáil ar deireadh sa Teach ach do dhaoine sa ghailearaí poiblí tugaim faoi deara nach bhfuil móran acu ann de bharr nach bhfuil aon chóras aistriúcháin ann. Ba mhaith liom go leigheasfaí é sin ar bhealach éigin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Táim an-shásta gur thug an Teach deis dom cúpla rud a rá faoin mBille seo. Os rud é go bhfuil tuiscint níos feárr anois ar na fadhbanna a bhaineann le cúraimí údarás na Gaeltachta bhíos ag súil go mbeadh straitéis nua leagtha síos ag an Aire Stáit don údarás. Chomh fada is a bhain sé le haidhmeanna an Údaráis fostaíocht a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht d'éirigh go maith leis an údarás agus tréaslaím leo as an méid postanna nua a chruthaigh siad imbliana.</P>
      <P>Ach tá an gearán ann nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt go forleathan taobh istigh de na limistéir Ghaeltachta. Nuair a bhí an Bille á thabhairt isteach ag an Aire Stáit chun ballraíocht Bhord an údaráis a mhéadú, bhí daoine ag ceistiú céard faoin IDA a bhfuil suim acu i mbunú tionscal sa tír seo ach gur theip orthu san iarthar.</P>
      <P>I dTuarascáil Bhliaintiúil an IDA chuir an príomh fheidhmeannach Seán Dorgan in iúl that there would be a new focus in IDA Ireland. For the future, the organisation would undertake a more targeted approach towards regional locations. Apart from the jobs dispersal issue, he said there was a need to bring a better mix of industry sectors and higher value industries to some locations, particularly locations that are not seeing the emergence of modern industries. As sin bhí dualgas ar an Aire Stáit ball den IDA a chur ar an mBord ach níor chuir sé. Chuir sé ball ar an Choiste Meastóireachta nua tá bunaithe aige chun iarrataisí nua a scrúdú ach níor chuir sé duine ón IDA ar an mBord. Bheadh sé an-thábhachtach go mbeadh duine ón IDA ag freastal ar chruinnithe an Bhoird.</P>
      <P>Tá stráitéis nua réigiúnda ceaptha acu agus dúirt an tAire Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta, Mary Harney, go raibh sí ag cur brú orthu na ceantair in iarthar na hÉireann a dhíol. Is dóigh liomsa nach ndéanann an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán aon iarracht eolas a fháil ón IDA cad tá ina gcinn acu.</P>
      <P>Muna bhfuil ball den IDA ar bhord an údaráis beidh airgead na tíre seo á chaitheamh ag an údarás chun tionscail a mhealladh ón Eoraip agus ó áiteanna eile thar lear chun na hÉireann agus beidh an IDA ag dul sa treo céanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an-dul chun cinn déanta ag foireann an Údaráis ach tá an-chuid bainisteoirí ann. Cén fáth <Col N="699" /> nár dhein an tAire Stáit aon iarracht chun stráitéis nua a leagadh amach don údarás? Cén fáth nár lua sé aon iarracht in a óráid chun ról tábhachtach nua a thabhairt don údarás?</P>
    <P>Is í an iascaireacht an príomh tionscal sa Ghaeltacht. Bhunaigh Roinn na Mara coiste chun dian staidéar a dhéanamh ar an iascaireacht ach ní raibh éinne ón Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán nó ó Údarás na Gaeltachta ar an choiste sin. Cén fáth nach raibh? Is eagal liom go bhfuil an Roinn seo ag druidim níos faide ó na Ranna Stáit eile.</P>
    <P>An bhfuil éinne i measc na members and alternatives ó Údarás na Gaeltachta nó ó Roinn na Gaeltachta ar an National Strategy Group on the Review of the Common Fisheries Policy: Padraic White, Edwin Alkin, Anthony Mannix, Cecil Beamish, Joey Murrin, John Nolan, Frank Doyle, Richie Flynn, Tom Geoghegan, Peter Heffernan, Pat Keogh, Mark Lochrin, Michael Long, John Lynch, Stephen McCahill.

      <P>Yes, Donal O Driscoll, Bernie Wright agus Michael Keatinge. Gan éinne ón údarás. Cén fáth? Nach bhfuil suim ag an údarás san iascaireacht?</P>
      <P>Tá locht eile agamsa ar líon na ndaoine ar bhord an údaráis. Cén fáth nach bhfuil duine ó Chomhdháil Oileán na hÉireann ann? Nach iad sin na daoine a bhfuil comhnaí orthu sna hoileáin, áiteanna iargúlta.  Bhí an tAire Stáit i láthair ag cruinniú cinnbhliana na Comhdhála i nGaillimh imbliana agus sa Tuairisc Bhliantúil dúirt an cathaoirleach: &ldquo;Beagnach i gcomhnaí tá sé fágtha suas do na hoileánaigh a gcuid fostaíochta féin a chruthú. Is de bharr seo atá an iomarca ag brath ar thionscal na turasóireachta agus is obair shéasúrach den chuid is mó atá ag daoine. Séasúr fíor-ghairid atá ann de bharr cúrsaí aimsire agus dá bhrí sin is beag cos-bhuan sa tionscal seo atá ann. Ní mór do na húdaráis breathnú ar na ceisteanna seo ar bhealach cruthaitheach. Is cinnte go bhfuil féidireachtaí ag baint leis an teicneolaíocht maidir le fostaíocht ar feadh na bliana ar na hoileáin agus ba cheart go mbeadh traenáil chuí curtha ar fáil d'oileánaigh gur spéis leo seo.</P>
      <P>Bhí an cathaoirleach ag déanamh cás anseo chun duine ó Chomhdháil Oileán na hÉireann a bheith ar bhord an údaráis agus níor ghlac an tAire Stáit an deis chun sin a dhéanamh. Iarraim air seans a thabhairt do na hoileánaigh teangbháil a dhéanamh leis na daoine a bhfuil tograí á mbunú acu do na hoileánaigh.</P>

    <P>Ar nuachtán <i>Foinse </i>na deireadh seachtaine 19 Meán Fomhair 1999, bhí gach duine ag déanamh gearáin i dtaobh labhairt na Gaeilge. Ar an chéad leathanach, bhí an tAire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, Míchéal Ó Máirtín, ag déanamh meas ar an scrúdú ard-leibhéal Gaeilge. Níos faide síos bhí droch-scéal eile i dtaobh na Gaeilge. Ach an <Col N="700" /> droch-scéal is mó, dar liomsa, gur theip ar Ollscoil na Gaillimhe scríbhneoir a fháil. Cén fáth nach bhfuil ról ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i gcultúr an réigiúin sin? Rinne an ollscoil iarracht scríbhneoir cónaithe a aimsiú don bhliain acadúil 1999-2000 agus ní bhfuarthas ach dhá iarratas agus ní rabhadar sásta le ceachtar acu. An bhfuil an tAire in ann béim a chur ar an údarás chun an saol cultúrtha a ghlacadh mar aidhm ag Údarás na Gaeltachta?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí ar fad a labhair sa díospóireacht. Labhair 13 sa díospóireacht agus is comhartha é sin den spéis atá ag an Dáil agus ag Teachtaí Dála i gceist na Gaeilge agus i gceist na Gaeltachta. Tá mór-chuid ceisteanna tógtha le dhá lá anuas agus déanfaidh mé iarracht tabhair faoi cuid de na ceisteanna a fhreagairt, go mórmhór ceisteanna a bhaineann le straitéis an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Dírím ar cheist láidreacht nó laigeacht na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí. Ar bhealach amháin, ar ndóigh, tá fadhb ann agus ní haon mhaith dúinn é a shéanadh. Ceann de na fadhbanna atá ann, ar ndóigh, go bhfuil siar-ghluaiseacht daoine isteach is amach as na Gaeltachtaí. Tá daoine ag pósadh isteach gan Gaeilge agus cothaíonn sé seo fadhbanna. Ar imeall na Gaillimhe tá brú an bhaile mhóir. Ach, ag deireadh an lae, is rud amháin a shábhálfaidh an Ghaeltacht, 'sé sin má labhraíonn muintir na Gaeltachta Gaeilge lena gcuid gasúir. Is féidir leis an Stát cúnamh a thabhairt ach is ceist choinsiasach don phoball Gaeltachta iad féin, an labhróidh siad Gaeilge lena gcuid gasúir nó nach labhróidh. Má labhartar, tá sé le feiceáil chuile áit, fiú má imíonn gasúir ón Ghaeilge ar feadh scaití, go bhfilleann siad uirthi má tá sí acu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá ceist tógtha liom go minic ó tháinig mé isteach mar Aire Stáit maidir le teorainn na Gaeltachta. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an oifig staidreamh as ucht mór-chuid oibre a dhéanamh dom agus an t-eolas ar fad a d'iarr mé orthu faighte agam le mí anuas. Tá mapaí curtha ar fáil agus tá an t-eolas ar fad an-úsáideach. Ba mhaith liom léargas beag den mhéid atá faighte as an eolas seo a léiriú. Bhain me as gasúir scoile mar cuireann gasúir scoile an rud as an riocht uilig. Ag fágáil gasúir scoile as, níl ach cúig toghcheantair sa tír, taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ina bhfuil níos mó ná 10 fán gcéad den phoball ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil agus tarlaíonn sé, go bhfuil an cúig toghcheantair sin atá taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil cuid de na toghcheantair céanna istigh sa Ghaeltacht agus mar sin, an cúig eisceacht ina bhfuil níos mó ná 10 fán gcéad den phoball ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil, is ar imeall na Gaeltachta atá siad. Mar sin, is féidir a rá go ginearálta nach bhfuil aon cheantar taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a bhfuil níos mó ná 10 fán gcéad den phoball ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil. Go deimhin féin, <Col N="701" /> is beag ceantar sa tír go bhfuil níos mó ná 5 fán gcéad den phoball ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil. Mar sin, aon cheantar go bhfuil níos mó ná 10 fán gcéad ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil, is eisceacht é, go náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>As an 154 cheantair sa Ghaeltacht, tá 113, no 73 fán gcéad, go bhfuil níos mó ná 10 fán gcéad ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil. Nílim-se ag rá gur ceantair láidreacha 15 fán gcéad ná 20 fán gcéad ach tá mé ag rá go bhfuil siad eisceachtúil i gcomórtas leis an gcuid eile den tír. An t-aon brí atá le baint as sin, go raibh tionchar ag an stádas Gaeltachta le caomhnú na Gaeilge sna ceantair seo agus táimid ag caint ar 73 fán gcéad den Ghaeltacht. Árdaíonn sé seo ceist atá thar a bheith contráilte agus thar a bheith deacair le réiteach. Má bhí tionchar dearfach, go bhfuil sé le sonrú ins na staitisticí, go bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge iontu ná mar atá sna ceantair eile &ndash; mar shampla ceantair i gContae an Chláir go raibh Gaeilge iontu ag tús an Stáit seo &ndash; cén fáth go mbainfí glan amach as an nGaeltacht anois iad agus cén sochar teangeolaíochta a dhéanfadh sé do na ceantair sin. Sin ceist go mba mhaith liom go ndéanfaí i bhfad níos mó díospóireachta air sa Teach seo. B'fhéidir, le cúnamh Dé, go bhféadfadh muid é a phlé lá eile níos faide anonn go mion agus go domhain. Tá sé éasca ag daoine a bheith ag moladh réiteach aon líne ach an bhfuil tú ag dul ag deighilt pobail? Céard atá tú ag dul a dhéanamh? Má táimid ag dul ag breathnú ar an gceist seo caithfimid slat tomhais cruinn a leagan amach. Admhaím go bhfuil ceantair ann agus nach bhfuil difríocht ar bith idir iad, de réir staitisticí, agus an chuid eile den tír agus go gcaithfidh go bhfuil ceist an-mhór ann maidir le fanacht sa Ghaeltacht. I gcuid mhaith de na ceantair seo tá an daonra thar a bheith beag.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile thar a bheith spéisiúil, má bhreathnaíonn tú ar na staitisticí. Níl aon chúis loighiciúil, gur mhair ceantair ar nós an Rinn i bPort Láirge nó ar nós Ráth Cairn mar Ghaeltachtaí. Tá siad an-bheag, tá siad á sáineadh ar chuile thaobh ag pobail láidre Béarla. Ag an am céanna, duine a bith a théann go dtí an Rinn nó go Ráth Cairn, tuigfidh sé go bhfuil an Ghaeilge réasúnta láidir sna ceantair sin agus tá sé le feiceáil arís ar an daonáireamh. Sin rud a thugann misneach dom agus tógáil croí agus a deir liom go féidir pobal Gaeilge a thógáil fiú nuair a cheapfá go raibh gach rud id' aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor ceist tógtha faoi chumhachtaí an údaráis agus straitéis iomlán. B'fhéidir go bhfuil mé sean-fhaiseanta, ach creidim go gcaithfidh, ó thaobh ceapadh polasaí agus an Stát i gcoitinne, go bhfanfadh cuid mhaith de chumadh straitéise i láimh an Aire agus i láimh an Rialtais. Ag deireadh an lae, is iad siúd an t-aon dream amháin atá in ann an rud ar fad a tharraingt le chéile. Bhí caint ann, mar shampla, ar choiste comhairleach a chur ar bun &ndash; cineál dáil Gaeltachta &ndash; agus, go deimhin féin, mhol an t-údarás é sin nuair a lorg mé moltaí maidir le Bille an údaráis. Creidim, ó tharla go bhfuil an Roinn é féin, mar eagraíocht sa Ghaeltacht, that a bheith gafa le cursaí <Col N="702" /> Gaeilge agus go dtagann cuid mhaith de na scéimeanna faoin Roinn seachas faoin údarás, dá mbéadh a leithéid le bunú go mba cheart é a bhunú faoin Aire sa chaoi is go mbéadh an t-údarás agus an Roinn i bpáirtíocht lena chéile seachas ceann amháin ná an ceann eile. Comh maith le sin, mar is eol do na Teachtaí, bhunaigh me coiste comhairleach don óg le gairid le tuairimí na ndaoine óga a fháil faoi céard is ceart a dhéanamh faoi thodhchaí na Gaeltachta agus ba tógáil croí, ag an gcéad cruinnú le gairid, na daoine óga a fheiceáil ann agus éisteacht leo agus an spéis atá acu sa Ghaeltacht, cuid acu a thagann ó cuid de na Gaeltachtaí laga seo agus leis an spéis atá acu sa Ghaeltacht. Tháinig cuid acu ó chuid de na Gaeltachtaí laga seo agus léirigh siad dáiríreacht agus spéis i ndéanamh cinnte go mairfidh an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin tá mo Roinn i mbun comhráití maidir le cúrsaí pleanála teanga, rud nár déanadh dóthain de sa Ghaeltacht agus rud go mbeidh an-bhéim á chur air sna blianta a bheidh fágtha agamsa mar Aire Stáit sa Roinn.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt scéimeanna nua ceaptha ag an Roinn leis an nGaeilge a láidriú mar theanga i measc an phobail sa Ghaeltacht. Níl mé chun iad ar fad a áireamh ach mar shampla bhí campa samhraidh ann do lucht na Gaeltachta. Tá go leor scéimeanna cúntóirí teanga ann. Tá an-chúnamh á thabhairt d'eagraíocht na scoileanna Gaeltachta agus go leor nithe eile. Tá forbairt déanta ar TnaG &ndash; TG4 anois &ndash; agus ar Raidio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tógadh ceist maidir le heagraíochtaí ar nós Comhairlí Chontae agus na boird sláinte. Bhunaigh an Rialtas coiste eadránach faoi mo chathaoirleacht chun plé a dhéanamh leis na ranna stáit ar fad maidir leis na cúrsaí seo agus tá cuid mhaith oibre déanta. Tá go leor eile le déanamh. Bhí cruinnithe ní hamháin le ranna stáit eile ach bhí cruinniú débhealach againn le leithéidí na mbord sláinte chun na ceisteanna seo a phlé.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a dheimhniú leis an Teachta Ó hUiginn go mbeidh Bille Teanga ann. Beidh sé ann chomh luath agus is féidir. Cheana féin ó tháinig mé isteach sa Roinn tá an Bille Foras Thuaidh agus Theas, a raibh baint mór ag mo Roinnse leis, rite tríd an Dáil. Tá Bille an údaráis anseo linn inniu. Tá Bille Tithíochta ann agus ba mhaith liom a dheimhniiú gur cheadaigh an Rialtas cinn an Bhille sin le gairid. Bhí mé faoi dhó ar Raidio na Gaeltachta ag cur síos ar na hathraithe atá molta ar na scéimeanna tithíochta.</P>
    <P>Tá obair ar bun ar an mBille Teanga agus tá mé ag dul go dtí an Bhruiséal amárach chun caint a dhéanamh ar an obair atá ar bun ansin. Creidim féin nach bhfuil aon mhaith le Bille an údaráis agus le go leor den obair eile gan Bille láidir Teanga a bheith ann.</P>

      <P>Sa Bhille Oideachais, ar ndóigh, bhí soláthar faoi leith ann don chéad uair maidir le hoideachas Gaeltachta agus tá dream daoine le teacht le chéile chun breathnú i ndiaidh na ceiste sin. Tá mé féin ag tabhairt cúnaimh nach beag d'eagraíocht na scoileanna Gaeltachta le go mbeidh siad in ann tionchar a imirt ar an ngrúpa sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir le ceist na logainmneacha tá áthas orm go bhfuil brainse na logainmneacha aistrithe go dtí an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán. Tá i gceist tabhairt faoin obair sin freisin.</P>
      <P>Luadh ceisteanna eile. Luadh, mar shampla, pleanáil sa Ghaeltacht. Ba mhaith liom a rá anseo gan faitíos go bhfuil neamh aird iomlán déanta ag Comhairlí Chontae ar cheisteanna Gaeilge mar shlat tomhais pleanála sa Ghaeltacht. Nuair a bhí mise ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe chuir-eamar forálacha istigh i bplean an chontae maidir leis an nGaeilge. Caithfidh mé a rá nach gcreidim go bhfuil siad á bhfeidhmiú ach táid ann. Chuir na Comhairleoirí, go mór mhór na Comhairleoirí Gaeltachta, ann iad.</P>
      <P>Ach frí chéile níor thug na Comhairlí Chontae aon aird ar an cheist seo. Ach is cúis áthais dom sa Bhille Pleanála a foilsíodh le gairid go bhfuil don chéad uair soláthar teanga mar cheann de na rudaí gur féidir a chur san áireamh i gcúrsaí pleanála. Is céim an-mhór chun cinn í seo.</P>
      <P>Nuair a chuirtear na rudaí seo ar fad le chéile feictear thar réimse leathan de bhillí agus thar ranna stáit go bhfuil rudaí ar bun.</P>
      <P>Chaithfinn a rá nach dtagaim leis an dTeachta Ó hUiginn i rud amháin agus dúirt mé é seo leis cheana. Má chuirim dhá rud taobh le taobh agus má bhreathnaím orthu mar thionchar ar an nGaeilge is measa dar liomsa i bhfad na scéimeanna tithíochta seo a bhfuil buan-chomhnaí iontu agus is mó i bhfad an dochar a dheineann siad do staid na teanga sa Ghaeltacht ná aon teach saoire. Tá mo dhearcadh féin agam i dtaobh pleanála maidir le tithe saoire. Éinne a bhreathnaíonn ar thaifeadadh Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe gheobhaidh siad amach nuair a bhí mé ann gur chuir mé deireadh leo amuigh faoin dtuath. Ach ó thaobh na teanga de caithfimid a thuiscint gurb é an bagairt is mó ná scéimeanna tithíochta agus tithe á ndíol scun scan ar dhuine ar bith agus grúpaí móra daoine ag teacht chun comhnaithe buan i gceantair láidir Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Tá mé ag díriú ar an cheist sin agus tá sí pléite agam le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta. Baineann sé go mór le cúrsaí pleanála. Tá cúpla sampla an-spéisiúil de sin ann agus cúpla iarratas an-spéisiúil i gCorca Dhuibhne i láthair na huaire. Is ceist í seo go gcaithfimid breathnú go géar uirthi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le bun-struchtúr na Gaeltachta, tagann sé sin go bunúsach faoin Roinn agus tá obair nach beag déanta ag mo Roinnse le cúpla bliain i dtaobh bóithre agus céibheanna agus táimid i dteangbháil le haonaid stáit eile ar nós Bord Soláthar <Col N="704" /> an Leictreachais, Telecom Éireann etc maidir le bun-seirbhísí.</P>
    <P>Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach de réir mar atá forbairt á dhéanamh ar na rudaí seo go mbeadh an oiread dul chun cinn á dhéanamh ag na Gaeltachtaí agus atá á dhéanamh  sa chuid eile den tír.</P>
    <P>Tá rún agam críochnú más féidir liom ar ceathrú chun a chúig agus mar sin déanfaidh mé iarracht díriú ar chuid de na ceisteanna a ardaíodh. Go ginearálta ardaíodh ceisteanna faoi monarchana éagsúla. Chaithfinnse a rá cé go mbéinn gearánach ó thráth go chéile faoi rudaí áirithe atá déanta ag an údarás. Is dóigh liom go ginearálta áfach má chuireann tú na ceantair Ghaeltachta i gcomparáid le ceantair teorannach leo sa Ghalltacht ó thaobh na tionsclaíochta de go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag déanamh níos feárr de bharr an údaráis a bheith ann.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist an Bhlascaoid, agus d'iarr an Teachta Joe Higgins orm freagairt dó seo go sonrach, ceist í seo go mb'fhéidir nach bhfuil an oiread rud agamsa dí agus a bheadh ag an Teachta Ó hUiginn. Is tábhachtaí domsa na Gaeltachtaí in a bhfuil daoine fós ag labhairt Gaeilge ionntu. Is é an chéad chloch ar mo phaidrín, mar dhuine a bhfuil comhnaí air sa Ghaeltacht agus a úsáideann an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth theanga, ná na Gaeltachtaí atá beo, na hoileáin ar a bhfuil daoine fós ag labhairt Gaeilge ionntu. Cuirim iad sa chéad áit. Dá mbeadh rogha agamsa amárach idir Oileán Thoraigh, Inis Oírr, Inis Meán, Inis Mór agus an Blascaod chuirfinn na hoileáin a bhfuil an teanga beo fós orthu i bhfad chun tosaigh ar an iarsmalann marbh. Is é an job atá le déanamh agamsa mar Aire Stáit agus an cúram atá orm ná déanamh cinnte nach Blascaoidí uilig ó thaobh na teanga de a bheidh sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag leagadh amach mo thosaíochtaí.</P>
    <P>D'fhiafraigh an Teachta Kenny díom an bhféadfainn liosta de na bailte fearann a mbeidh vóta acu i dtoghcháin an údaráis a thabhairt dó. Déanfaidh mé cinnte go mbeidh cóip ar fáil. Is rud úsáideach é sin nuair a bheidh plé á dhéanamh ar theorannacha na Gaeltachta, ar thodhchaí na Gaeltachta agus ar cén caoi is féidir cur chuig an cheist acrannach seo a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Choiste Meastóireachta, creidim féin go bhfuil míthuiscint faoi cad tá i gceist anseo. An chúis go bhfuil an Coiste Meastóireachta ann ná go dtí seo idir £1.6m agus £2.4m bhí cead an Aire ag teastáil. Ba é mo bharúil ar an cheist seo, mar dhuine a bhíodh ag cur iarrataisí isteach go dtí an t-údarás, go mba rud contráilte ar fad é cead an Aire a fháil. Mar gurb é an rud a tharlaíodh ná go dtagfadh an rud go dtí Roinn agus d'fhéadfá a bheith ag fanacht ceithre nó cúig nó sé mhí sula dtiocfadh an rud chomh fada leis an Aire. Cheap tú nuair a bhí an rud ceadaithe ag an mBord go raibh rith an ráis leat, go bhféadfá dul ar aghaidh leis an togra agus fuair tú amach ansin go raibh cead an Aire ag teastáil. Agus théadh an rud go ranna stáit eile freisin, An Roinn Fiontair, Trádála agus Fostaíochta mar shampla. Faoin am go raibh cinneadh déanta ag an Aire &ndash; ach ní hé an tAire ann féin a bhí ag <Col N="705" /> déanamh cinnidh i bhfolús. Bhí cuid mhór moille á chur air. Shíl mise go mb'fhearr i bhfad an leagan amach fadálach sin a ghiorrú. In ionad a bheith ag dul, tar éis chinneadh an údaráis, go dtí na heagraíochtaí seo go mb'fhearr i bhfad coiste a chur ar bun taobh istigh den údarás chun na tograí seo os cionn £1.6m agus déanfaimid cinneadh ar an bpointe agus beidh inchur ag baill an údaráis nuair a bheas an cinneadh á dhéanamh agus mar sin ní féidir a bheith ag cur ina aghaidh ó i bhfad. Ó thaobh éifeachta cinnidh de, beidh sé seo i bhfad níos fearr.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Gaeilge a bheith ag na baill anseo, an fáth a bhfuil sé sin leagtha síos ná le baill tofa an údaráis tá sé suas don phobal, na daoine a ainmneoidh an tAire, ar ndóigh ainmneoidh Aire Gaeltachta daoine le Gaeilge. Maidir le foireann an údaráis, is ceist don údarás é. Bhí faitíos orainn ó tharla go raibh ainmniúcháin le teacht ón taobh amuigh nach gceapfaí Gaeilgeoirí agus is le teacht aniar aduaidh ar sin atá an coinníoll sin ann.</P>
    <P>Ardaíodh ceisteanna mar gheall ar na coistí reígiúnacha agus tá freagraí na gceisteanna siúd le fáil san Acht. Faoin seanAcht d'fhéadfadh sé tarlú nach mbeadh ach beirt ar choiste réigiúnach  &ndash; toghadh beirt ar a laghad i chuile ceantar ach d'fhéadfadh go mba leor duine amháin chun cinneadh a dhéanamh mar ní raibh aon chuóram reachtúil ann. Má bhreathnaítear ar an struchtúr nua, caithfidh ceathrar ar a laghad a bheith ar an gcoiste agus chomh maith leis sin, tá sé leagtha síos sa Bhille go gcaithfidh mórlach acu, sé sin triúr ar a laghad, a bheith i láthair chun aon chinneadh a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Is chuige sin go bhfuil an fhoráil sin san Acht, chun na rudaí neamhshásúla a bhí ag tarlú a stopadh. Mar sin tá cinneadh ciallmhar anseo a chuireann deireadh leis an gcineál rud a luaigh an Teachta Ó hUiginn. Dá dtarlódh sé gur chinn an t-údarás an iomarca cumhachta agus freagrachta a thabhairt do na coistí réigiúnacha seo, is féidir leis an Aire srian a chur leis an méid caiteachais is féidir le coiste réigiúnach a cheadú. Is dóigh gur glanadh suas é seo ar roinnt laigí a bhí ann. Ach níl aon srian ar an údarás maidir le haon choiste eile a cheapadh, comhairlí pobail san áireamh, má thograíonn siad, ach sin ceist eile.</P>
    <P>Tá cumhacht ghinearálta á thabhairt maidir le hordacháin. Glanadh suas is ea cuid de sin maidir le hamhras éigin a bhí ann maidir leis na hordacháin agus cuid eile de, is rud sonrach atá ann. Má tá muide tofa sa Teach seo agus Rialtas tofa leis an tír a stiúradh go mba cheart go mbeadh cumhacht ag an Aire ordacháin ghinearálta a thabhairt le déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil polasaí an údaráis ag teacht le polasaí an Stáit. Ní thagaim leis an smaoineamh go mba cheart go mbeadh na dreamanna go léir atá amuigh ansin in ann neamhaird a thabhairt ar an Rialtas agus ar an Oireachtas. Ní cumhacht é a d'úsáidfí ó lá go lá.</P>
    <P>Chuir mé ceist ar an údarás ar theastaigh aon chumhachtaí breise uathu agus dúirt siad faoin Acht mar atá sé, rud atá ceart, go bhféadfadh an <Col N="706" /> Rialtas beagnach aon chumhacht is maith leo a thabhairt dóibh. B'fhéidir gur rud é nár rinneadh ach níl aon laincis nó srian san Acht  &ndash; is srian gníomhaíochta atá ansin agus mar sin níl aon ghá leis an Acht a athrú le cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ballraíocht an bhoird, ba mhaith liom moladh a thabhairt don Teachta Ó hUiginn anseo. Nuair a cheap seisean Cathaoirleach ar an mbord don uair dheiridh cheap sé duine a bhí neamhspleách ar aon cheantar agus a bhí ann don Ghaeltacht uilig. Tá an chontúirt ann, de bhrí go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht chomh scoite, dá mbeadh na baill ag ceapadh Cathaoirleach go bhféachfaí air mar dhuine a raibh taobhú éigin le ceantar amháin. Mar sin tá ciall le Cathaoirleach a bheith á cheapadh ag an Aire. Tá sé ráite go soiléir sa mBille nach féidir le duine a sheas sa toghchán a bheith ceaptha mar Chathaoirleach agus mar sin ní féidir le duine a theip air sa toghchán teacht go ceann an bhoird.</P>
    <P>Is féidir linn líon na mball a phlé ag Céim an Choiste ach tá míniú an-simplí ar an uimhir. Ní raibh mé ag iarraidh go mbeadh an bord ró-mhór ach go mbeadh ceathrar ar a laghad i chuile réigiún mar ní fhéadfadh bord réigiúnda feidhmiú le níos lú.</P>
    <P>Maidir le scéimeanna EU, faightear airgead díreach uaidh agus faightear airgead EU eile ón Stát  &ndash; tá soláthar sa Bhille seo don dá rud.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an toghchán a chur siar, tá mo thuairim nochtaithe agam faoi go poiblí. Níl i gceist agamsa aon leasú a chur síos ar sin, ach má theastaíonn ó bhaill an fhreasúra leasú a chur síos beidh mé sásta é a phlé amach go hiomlán agus a mhíniú cén fáth go gcreidim nach é leas an údaráis ná leas phobal na Gaeltachta na toghcháin seo a chur siar níos faide.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an leas-Cheann Comhairle as a bheith flaithiúil leis an am agus tá súil agam gur fhreagair mé bunáite na gceisteanna a tógadh. Tá mé fíorbhuíoch le chuile dhuine a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht bhríomhar oscailte seo agus tá mé ag tnúth lena leithéid chéanna ag Céim an Choiste den Bhille.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Hospital Charges.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. This case concerns a 68 year old pensioner and medical cardholder who underwent emergency open&ndash;</P>
      <P>heart surgery in the Blackrock Clinic in mid-1998. The Minister for Health and Children is refusing to reimburse the cost of the operation.</P>
      <P>The man concerned had been suffering from recurring chest pains and went to see his general practitioner in May 1998. The general practitioner referred him to a cardiologist at the Blackrock Clinic. He was examined by the cardiologist on 21 May and it was decided that he should undergo a stress test which was carried out on 22 May. The patient failed the test. The cardiologist informed him that something was wrong and that he should arrange for an angiogram.</P>
      <P>The patient accepted that he had to pay the cardiologist for his professional attendance and for the stress test. These cost £80 and £97, respectively. He further understood that he would have to pay about £1,000 for the angiogram. Because he was by now very concerned about his condition he paid this sum from personal savings and had the angiogram at the Blackrock Clinic on 29 May. About 20 minutes after completion of the angiogram he was informed by the cardiologist that he needed immediate heart surgery and that his condition was so serious that he should be kept in the hospital in intensive care and that it might even be necessary for him to undergo the operation that night.</P>
      <P>The problem now was that the surgery would cost about £10,000 and he did not have the money. He discussed the matter with his wife and they decided that they had no choice but to authorise the hospital to go ahead with the operation. The patient was kept in intensive care at the Blackrock Clinic and successfully underwent the operation on 2 June. He has since made a full recovery.</P>
      <P>In due course he received a bill from the Blackrock Clinic which was eventually reduced to £10,000. The patient borrowed this sum from his family and paid the bill. He applied to the Eastern Health Board and the Minister for Health and Children for financial assistance towards the cost of the surgery but both refused relying on the distinction which was made in the 1991 Health (Amendment) Act between public and private health care. I have pursued the matter over the past year with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and there is a sizeable file of correspondence between us. The Minister's argument is that because this patient opted for &ldquo;treatment in a private hospital he is liable for the costs and that neither the Department nor the health boards are in a position to provide financial assistance towards the costs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In normal circumstances this response would <Col N="708" /> be acceptable. However, in this case it is harsh and uncaring. This man did not voluntarily opt for treatment in a private hospital &ndash; he had no choice. He was lying on a trolley being told that he had an urgent, life threatening heart condition and that he needed immediate surgery. Who in their right mind would leave the hospital to shop and wait around in the public health system for an admission?</P>
    <P>This man needs financial assistance towards his medical costs. The daughter from whom he borrowed the money, and who is living abroad with her own family responsibilities, needs the money back. Had this patient not gone ahead with the operation he might not have survived. Had he survived and eventually been seen through the public hospital system, the State would have had to pay the cost of his care anyway. Indeed, as sometimes happens in urgent cardiac cases, he might have ended up back in the Blackrock Clinic with the State paying the bill.</P>
    <P>The distinction between financing the public and private health systems is not absolute as the Minister well knows. Indeed his recent decision to make £50 million available to the VHI is evidence of considerable State assistance to private medical care. This is an individual case and, while I appreciate that there may be departmental worries about creating a precedent, I believe this case is exceptional and one-off. I invite the Minister to investigate this case and to contact the Blackrock Clinic and the cardiologist directly to establish the facts and the bona fides of the case, and to find some way of providing financial assistance to this very exceptional human need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The hospital involved in this case is a private hospital and receives no funding from the Department of Health and Children. The Minister has no function in the provision of services by that hospital or on the level of charges set by it or its consultants.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services is primarily based on means rather than payment of income tax or PRSI. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Persons in category 1 are medical cardholders and are entitled to a full range of services free of charge. Services provided include: general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including non-consultant services, and out-patient public hospital services, including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland who does not have category 1 cover automatically has category 2 cover. These non-medical cardholders are <Col N="709" /> entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultant services, and out-patient public hospital services including consultant services. The current public hospital statutory in&ndash;</P>
    <P>patient charge is £25 per night, up to a maximum of £250 in any 12 consecutive months. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of £20 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1991, it was possible for a patient to be treated as a private patient of a consultant and as a public patient of a public hospital. The Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, removed the entitlement to combine public and private elements of in-patient care at the same time. The position now is that every patient is entitled to full public hospital services, including public accommodation and public consultant care. Alternatively, one can opt to be a private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Any patient, whether a medical card holder or not, who opts for treatment in a private hospital or as a private patient in a public hospital is normally liable for the costs relating to such treatment.</P>
    <P>A refund of tax in respect of medical expenses incurred by any individual, his or her spouse, or children, may be claimed by making an application to one's local tax office. Relief is payable on un-reimbursed medical expenses over £100 per person or £200 per family. There are certain expenses which are excluded from the relief. These include costs relating to normal pregnancy, sight testing and advice on routine dental treatment.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the circumstances of this case I will ask the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to examine the case on clinical and compassionate grounds as a matter of urgency. That is all I can promise the Deputy but he has made a genuine case and I will look at it again on his behalf.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Adjournment Debate." RHead="- Remedial Works">
    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Remedial Works.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and I am grateful to the Minister for coming into the House to debate the very real danger to the people of certain parts of Cobh from the threat of landslides.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, recently visited Cobh to view the situation. However, another landslide occurred two days ago. Large rocks and boulders narrowly missed destroying a back kitchen just below where a retaining wall collapsed. There are five children in a nearby house and the family is afraid to use the rear of the house as there is a danger that more of the wall will collapse. Shortly before the landslide a little girl was standing on the ground that fell away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware and concerned about this situation but I raised this issue in the House eight <Col N="710" /> months ago. Only now is there any sign that work might occur. The family involved was very lucky this time and I implore the Minister to ensure that all possible efforts will be made to ensure that the necessary work is carried out in all the at risk areas in Cobh as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Fort Villas is of particular concern. A rock fall occurred there a number of years ago and this could happen again at any time. This fall resulted in the access road to a number of houses being closed to traffic &ndash; the road just fell away. Vehicle owners cannot access their houses. What if there is a fire? Emergency services cannot access a number of houses. Some people, including elderly people have to climb more than 70 steps. In addition to the dangers posed by landslides, these people are deprived of access to their homes using vehicular traffic.</P>
    <P>Last February the Minister told me that he was concerned about money and cost. I understand this concern and I know that permission has been given to carry out some work. However, a rock fall in any of the at risk areas could occur at any time. Urgent remedial work is needed in all the at risk areas to safeguard life and property. Neither the Minster nor I wants to have to stand in the House and express sympathy and regret for a tragedy that might occur, God forbid, if remedial works are not carried out.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure that short cuts are not taken and that cost cutting or skimping does not occur to save money? This is a serious issue. I ask the Minister to ensure that the job is done properly, comprehensively and where it is needed so that the people of Cobh can go about their business without the threat of death or injury and that we can sleep easily in our beds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The urban area of Cobh is unique in terms of the geological and structural problems which exist there. The geology of the area is limestone shale which following excavation and weathering has become unstable in certain areas, and this instability has been exacerbated by the manner in which Cobh has developed, especially in the last century.</P>
      <P>As a result of the construction of the naval dockyard and supply port at Haulbowline the population of the town grew from a few hundred at the beginning of the 1800s to 7,000 by 1837. Demand for accommodation meant that hillsides were excavated to create building space and access roads. This activity resulted in very steep slope faces, and rock faces of up to 90 degrees behind houses. The excavated stone was used to construct the houses, roads and retaining walls, and the retaining walls were generally substandard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a fatality caused by a landslide in 1980, the Department has given considerable financial assistance towards remedial works undertaken by Cobh UDC to strengthen areas susceptible to landslides. The assistance takes the form of 100 per cent grants, subject to prior approval of the remedial works by the Department. Since <Col N="711" /> 1980, grants of almost £1.5 million have been paid to the UDC.</P>
    <P>Cobh UDC has identified the following projects requiring remedial works: Harbour View Slope, Connolly Street, East Hill, Fort Villas, High Road west of museum, Harbour View Slope and Harbour View. In January 1999 the Department of Finance, on foot of a submission from the Department, sanctioned an increased overall limit of expenditure of £3.775 million to cover the above projects. In April 1999 approval issued to the local authority to accept the recommended tender for works at Harbour View Slope and Connolly Street, estimated to cost £378,000. With regard to those works next prioritised by the local authority, East Hill and Fort Villas, the position is as follows. In 1999 approval to prepare contract documents in respect of works at Fort Villas issued to the UDC. These have not yet been received in my Department. In the case of East Hill approval to contract documents in respect of works at this area issued in June 1999 and the council was advised to seek tenders for the work. It is understood from the council that the tender process for these works has not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>Following a rockfall at East Hill on Tuesday, 28 September, the local authority sought the Department of the Environment and Local Government's approval to arrange for emergency works to be carried out in order to avoid a risk to public safety. The Department issued approval to the local authority on 29 September 1999 to immediately carry out the works necessary to make the location safe.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to reassure the Deputy that he shares his concern about the situation in Cobh and while works undertaken from public funds must be cost effective and properly prioritised, the Minister is satisfied that his Department has made the resources available to enable the council carry out the remedial works which have been identified and prioritised.</P>

      <P>While the House was in recess difficulties arose in a number of hospitals resulting in theatres and beds being closed, deriving directly from nursing shortages which are particularly acute in the Eastern Health Board area, particularly in Dublin hospitals. In April this year the Mater Hospital had a shortfall of 67 nurses while Beaumont Hospital had a shortfall of 60 nurses. Currently the Mater Hospital has 3,759 patients on its in-patient hospital waiting list, many awaiting treatment for in excess of 12 months and far too many awaiting treatment for in excess of two years. Beaumont Hospital is in the same position. In the context of the Mater Hospital there are 1,359 cardiac patients awaiting in-patient hospital treatment, hundreds of whom are awaiting major heart surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I tabled a Dáil question to be answ<Col N="712" /> ered by the Minister to ascertain whether the level of nursing shortages had further deteriorated and whether there were fewer nurses now available in some hospitals than was the case last April. I would have expected, due to the problems of 34,000 people on waiting lists and the ongoing waiting list crisis and the publicity during the summer months which indicated theatres and beds were closing due to nursing shortages that this issue would have had the personal attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the context of the threatened nursing strike, part of the problem in this area derives from the fact that nurses are over worked and feel they are working under far too great a pressure, particularly in the Dublin and Eastern Health Board areas, because of staff shortages. I would have expected the Minister to know where we stand in the context of nursing shortages and to have in place some form of strategy to tackle the problem. In reply to my Dáil question I was told by the Minister that the most recent survey of nursing vacancies was that carried out last April to which I referred and that he has no up to date information of any nature. In the context of his response to the question he said he would ask the health service employers' agency to carry out a further study of the position as of 30 September.</P>
    <P>This is indicative of the Minister's neglect of our health service. I would have expected that a Minister half involved in his Department, in the context of discovering that theatres were closing in major hospitals with responsibility for national specialities, would have ensured that he had the most up to date information at his fingertips. I would have expected the Minister to be taking initiatives to ensure we made good the nursing shortfall where necessary in particular hospitals. I would have expected him to be liaising with the voluntary hospitals and indeed the health board hospitals and the health boards where these difficulties are being experienced.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister yet again is not taking seriously the problems and difficulties of nurses or the waiting list crisis. Apparently he believes that when theatres and beds close there is no particular need for him to even find out information, let alone intervene. I call on the Minister to take a far more active interest in this area, to actually do his job because I believe he is failing to do his job properly, is exacerbating the nursing crisis and the waiting list crisis and is directly responsible through his neglect of the difficulties in this area for the hospital beds and theatres which have closed and for people awaiting vital in-patient hospital treatment being deprived of the treatment to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to clarify the situation regarding nurse shortages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to point out to the Deputy <Col N="713" /> that my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, inherited the nurse shortage situation. Deputy Shatter's party, and before that the Labour Party, had control of the Department of Health and the manpower requirements for nursing. The numbers coming out of the nursing schools now were not agreed by Minister Cowen&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>If the supply is inadequate the blame need not be laid at Minister Cowen's door. I would point out that Minister Cowen increased the number of nursing training places last year and again this year. In 1998 a new school of general nursing was established in the Midland Health Board area with an annual intake of 20 places. The combined intake of the two schools attached to Tallaght hospital was also increased by 33 places in 1998. This year Minister Cowen made available funding for 100 extra training places in general and psychiatric nursing and these have been offered to applicants who successfully came through the competition.</P>
      <P>I am glad to take this opportunity to refer to the highly successful outcome to this year's competitions for training places on the nursing diploma programme. As the Minister for Health and Children announced yesterday, a total of 1,217 training places have been filled &ndash; 819 in general nursing, 242 in psychiatric nursing and 156 in mental handicap nursing.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the promotional campaigns have raised the profile of both psychiatric nursing and mental handicap nursing. This year we succeeded in filling a record 242 training places in psychiatric nursing compared with only 92 in 1998, and a record 156 places in mental handicap nursing compared with 117 last year. It is true that the Deputy asked for comparative figures on nursing shortages for September 1998 and September 1999 and these are not available in the Department. The most recent survey of nursing vacancies carried out by the Health Service Employers' Agency related to the position at the end of April 1999 and found that of the 566 staff nurse vacancies nationwide, all but 30 were in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen has asked the HSEA to carry out a further study on the position at 30 September 1999. He will also consider whether such statistics should be collected on a monthly basis. He is somewhat concerned, however, that doing so simply places further administrative burdens on health agencies, particularly the nursing and <Col N="714" /> personnel departments, where time might be better spent on efforts to recruit nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a proper information system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that employment of nurses is at an all time high. The whole time equivalent number of nursing staff in the public health service at the end of December 1998 was 27,586, an 11 per cent increase since 1990. Within this upward trend there has been a significant change in that more qualified nurses have been engaged to replace the traditional student nurses whose education has changed from an apprenticeship model to a third level supernumerary basis.</P>
      <P>OECD health data for 1998 also show that Ireland is significantly out of line with other European countries in relation to the very high ratio of nurses per hospital bed employed here. We have 1.26 nurses per hospital bed while France has 0.42.</P>
      <P>The principal difficulties relating to the recruitment and retention of nurses are concentrated in the Dublin area. While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the State, investment in hospitals and development of regional specialities over recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area. Within Dublin, issues such as housing costs, traffic problems and lack of car parking facilities have been cited as disincentives to the recruitment and retention of nurses. However, these issues are not unique to the health service.</P>
      <P>Nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals, and the level of vacancies fluctuates accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers and moving from one employment to another. I understand that a number of newly qualified nurses have started or will start work in some of the major Dublin hospitals this week.</P>
      <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, who take their own initiatives in this regard, a range of initiatives has been taken or is being processed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, to improving it, as requested by the Deputy. These initiatives include the following: arrangements have been agreed with the nursing unions to allow more favourable assimilation arrangements on to pay scales for nurses taking up both permanent and temporary employment and there has been a significant improvement regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialist areas, such as operating theatres and intensive care units is being introduced. Implementation of these increased allowances is subject to a&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister in the House. In fairness to him, he gave me a commitment a number of months ago that he would try to make progress with this school. He did his job and I accept that. I am afraid, however, that the officials in his Department did not do their job.</P>
      <P>In September we were disappointed again that the children of Carrakennedy had to go into a community hall, which we were lucky to have, to be taught. They will be going in there in the winter, cold, miserable and wet, having to cross a very dangerous road. I am disappointed with the officials in the Minister's Department. I hold them responsible. They have not dealt with this. I am only talking about a small extension. In my area I have seen holiday villages, hotels and developments of 30 houses designed, planned, permitted, built and occupied within six months. We are six months down the road and we have not reached the planning stage within the Department. I ask the Minister &ndash; not for me, not for the political system, but for the children that have to attend Carrakennedy school &ndash; to make a telephone call to his officials and tell them to deal with this serious problem.</P>
      <P>We do not want the situation to arise where we are both here again before Christmas after I have contacted the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's office to call for an Adjournment debate to see what is happening. I ask the Minister to do what he did before. The money was sanctioned and we were told that these children would be in the school by Christmas. They will not be there by Christmas 2001 with what is happening now. I ask the Minister to intervene immediately.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the school had to call someone from the health board because there was a problem with mice. It is not nice and it is not right to have young children being taught in facilities like that. It is not a big job &ndash; I am not looking for a new school, just an extension.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the members of this community. The Minister's Department asked them for a contribution. It was such an emergency that the small community held dances and had raised the money in a shot because everyone realised there was a problem in the area. It is one of the few rural areas where people are building houses and moving in. They will not, however, stay there for long if they do not have the same facilities as towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ask his officials, as a matter of priority, to do what must be done. It is not <Col N="716" /> acceptable that it has taken six months to get to this stage. The least the public service could do is push this on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House, on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, the current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Carrakennedy national school, Westport, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The school has a current staffing of a principal, two assistant teachers, a shared remedial teacher and a shared resource teacher who is not based in the school. The permanent accommodation consists of two classrooms with sanitary facilities. An application for the provision of a third classroom was received from the school management in April 1998 to alleviate an over-crowding problem. This problem became even more acute with the appointment of a second assistant teacher in September 1998. At that time the school had an enrolment of 63 pupils. Classes are currently being held in the local community hall and the Department is grant-aiding 95 per cent of the rental costs.</P>
      <P>A number of proposals for improving the accommodation were put by the Department to the board of management in November 1998 and it opted for a one classroom extension and a staff-resource room. In January 1999 the board of management informed the Department that it had decided not to engage a design team which had been offered by us and it requested the Department's architectural staff to design the scheme. A member of the Department's architectural team subsequently visited the school to assess conditions there.</P>
      <P>A sketch scheme has been prepared and this has been accepted by the board of management. Planning permission drawings are currently being finalised and these will be furnished to the board of management shortly for submission to the local planning authority, Mayo County Council. I know Deputy Ring will ensure an expeditious decision is made there. The statements he has made are factual and I empathise with the problems in the school because we cannot have vermin or other difficulties in any school in modern times. That is neither acceptable nor tolerable. The Deputy comes from the second fastest growing town in the country and decisions are made fairly quickly at local authority level. He can be assured of my support, when we get the planning document, in arriving at a positive conclusion. The project will be progressed as quickly as possible through the remaining stages of the architectural planning process.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position. He can be assured of my personal interest and the Department's full support in achieving rapid decisions.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 October 1999.</P>

      <P>the employment of the North-Eastern Health Board. No caesarean hysterectomies have been carried out at the hospital in question, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, since the matter was first brought to the attention of the health board in late October 1998.</P>
      <P>Since receiving the report of the review group, the North-Eastern Health Board has made a range of important improvements at the hospital, with the full participation and co-operation of all relevant consultant and nursing staff. The North-Eastern Health Board has made the following improvements at the hospital: revised protocols and procedures for the maternity unit and delivery suite to ensure best practice are now in place; all of the relevant hospital consultant and nursing staff have and are co-operating fully with the North-Eastern Health Board management in implementing agreed protocols and procedures including audits of these procedures; new arrangements for the management of ante-natal clinics; admission protocols regarding assessment and discharge of women who are in labour are in place; a twice-weekly reporting system is in place which involves consultants and midwifery staff; improvements in the consultative process regarding the management of midwifery and obstetric care and the use of customer care satisfaction surveys.</P>
      <P>In relation to the patients of the former consultant, the board has taken a number of steps in support of patients who may have been affected: a helpline and advisory service continues to be available to patients with any queries; independent medical advice continues to be made available to any patient involved; a comprehensive range of support and counselling services are still available to patients and their families and the North-Eastern Health Board has been working closely with general practitioners of the patients involved to give them information and advice.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board has emphasised that it will continue to assist patients and their families in any way possible, and that consultants and nursing staff are committed to providing the best care for all of their patients. The board has a high quality clinical team in place at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, everyone, regardless of income is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. At present these charges are set at £25 per day, subject to a maximum of £250 in any 12 month period, in respect of in-patient public hospital services. Any patient who is formally admitted as an in-patient, including as a day case, of the hospital is liable for the £25 in-patient charge, unless otherwise exempt. Non-medical card holders are entitled to public out-patient services free of charge.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 61, 71, 103 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to yesterday's reply to similar questions. In that reply, I indicated that officials of my Department have been in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on future funding arrangements for rehabilitative and vocational training for people with a disability.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the next operational programme and its measures are ongoing between relevant Departments and the European Commission. Similarly, negotiations on the national development plan, NDP, have yet to be completed.</P>
      <P>The backdrop to the inter-departmental discussions, related to the disability sector, is the planned change in institutional responsibilities for services for people with a disability set out in the report, Building a Future Together. The relevant recommendation which is being acted upon is that responsibility for vocational training for people with a disability will be mainstreamed at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That Department is also the lead Department for the current human resources development operational programme and is spearheading the discussions on the next operational programme and the national action plan, for employment.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been anxious to ensure that the NDP and the NAP satisfactorily provide the emphasis necessary to maintain, at a minimum, the current level of vocational training for people with a disability and that, where possible, additional supports will be made available for the years 2000 to 2006. This is against a background where reduced funding will be available from EU sources and priorities for expenditure will be solidly linked to the objectives of the NAP.</P>
      <P>Future details of vocational training supports for people with a disability in the next operational programme, when they become clear, should be available from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the valued work carried out by the National Training and Development Institute and <Col N="720" /> by other organisations in the not for profit business association which provide services for people with disabilities. The establishment of new responsibilities and arrangements for vocational training will have regard to the expertise of such organisations.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the need to have high quality diagnostic and symptomatic breast cancer services in this country. When Breast Check, the national breast screening programme was launched recently, I announced that I was commissioning a review of the diagnostic and symptomatic breast cancer services currently available throughout the country. I requested the National Cancer Forum to carry out the review with the following terms of reference: to assess the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the forthcoming national breast screening programme; the increase in the target population; the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening; and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening.</P>
      <P>The group are to make recommendations to me on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs, the need to develop associated services, the resources required to develop these services and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of diagnostic services to ensure equity of access to, and the highest quality in, the provision of diagnostic services for breast disease.</P>
      <P>I understand that this review is now at an advanced stage. The National Cancer Forum expects to receive the report on the review at their December meeting. The forum will analyse the report and forward the necessary recommendations to me on the matter.</P>

      <P>My Department has not commissioned any research to date into this issue. However, a number of health boards have carried out studies as follows.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board established a working party on child prostitution which reported in 1997 The Mid-Western Health Board published a report entitled, Prostitution in the Mid-Western Health Board Region, in 1998. In the case of the North-Eastern Health Board, while the board has not carried out any empirical research, it has developed a programme entitled, Youth Initiative</P>
      <P>Partnership, to respond to the needs of children who are being sexually abused, including those involved in prostitution.</P>
      <P>Child prostitution is primarily a child protection issue and all health boards are conscious of the need to target services at children who are at risk of becoming involved in prostitution.</P>
      <P>A very significant finding from the survey carried out by the working party on child prostitution in the Eastern Health Board was that more than 80 per cent of children identified as having an involvement in child prostitution either had experienced, or were experiencing, homelessness. In this regard, I am putting significant additional resources into addressing the issue of homelessness particularly in the Eastern Health Board region where the problem is most acute. In addition, a national strategy on youth homelessness is being prepared and a forum on youth homelessness has been established in the Eastern Health Board region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Private Health Insurance which arises from commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium represents the first ever Government statement of policy on the sector since voluntary health insurance was instituted over 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>The White Paper seeks to provide a framework for health insurance which will consolidate and facilitate a competitive market based on the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. It recognises that the current market framework needs to be reformed and sets out changes regarding regulation, structures and relationships which are intended to reflect the best interests of consumers and patients, and to promote a market characterised by service, quality and efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important dimension of the White Paper concerns the commitment of the Government to the development of the public health services. <Col N="723" /> The approach taken by the Government in the White Paper in relation to public hospital investment, bed designation and progressing towards more economic costing of private beds in public hospitals reflect a strong commitment to safeguarding the interests of public patients in our mixed public-private healthcare system.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes significant change in relation to market regulation and in the corporate status of the Voluntary Health Insurance board and involves legislation to give effect to these proposals. The Government have already approved the preparation of legislation to amend the Health Insurance Act, 1994, and arrangements have been made to commence drafting of a Bill in this respect. Regulations will be introduced to give effect to the proposals contained in the White Paper in relation to risk equalisation and age at entry community rating. Regulations will also be made to amend minimum benefit provisions to increase the lowest level of cover which an insurer may offer in respect of psychiatric illness by 20 days day-patient care and to simplify the existing regulations. Open enrolment regulations will be amended to provide entitlement to cover for persons of or over 65 years of age. In addition to this, my Department will prepare and submit for Government consideration, as soon as possible, heads of legislation in relation to a change in the corporate status of VHI.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has asked about plans to privatise the VHI. Under the White Paper, the Government propose to provide that the status of the VHI be changed, in the first instance, to that of a public limited company owned by the State. The envisaged legislation will also include enabling provisions for third party investment in VHI and for its full sale, if deemed desirable. The Government have decided to provide an investment in VHI of the order of £50 million to enable it to be considered for authorisation as an insurance company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision and management of the ambulance service in the Dublin area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A programme of investment in the ambulance service has been under way since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service in 1993 with in excess of £23 million having been invested in the ambulance service <Col N="724" /> nationally since 1993. As a result of this investment a range of major improvements in the ambulance service have been taking place. Progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the report include: more than 75 per cent of ambulance personnel have successfully completed cardiac training and the provision of a nationwide cardiac ambulance service is now nearing completion; the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet has improved greatly. Some 68 per cent of emergency ambulance vehicles are now less than five years old as compared to 48 per cent in 1994, and regional command and control centres are operational in four health board areas and a joint fire and ambulance control centre for the Dublin areas has recently been commissioned. Construction and equipping of regional command and control centres is at an advanced stage in the remaining health boards.</P>
    <P>In this context the Eastern Health Board has been pursuing a range of improvements in the ambulance service, including improved training, upgrading of the ambulance service fleet and the development of a command and control centre in partnership with Dublin Fire Brigade. A national standard of training as drawn up by the National Ambulance Advisory Council is being implemented in respect of all providers of pre-hospital care, including those employed by the Dublin Fire Brigade which provides an element of the ambulance service in the Dublin area on behalf of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that this year I secured funding of £1.375 million for the Eastern Health Board towards the continued provision of an efficient ambulance service for the region. It should be noted that this figure represents an increase of £800,000 or 139 per cent over the sum of £575,000 provided by the previous Government in 1997. Within the overall level of resources, it is a matter for the Eastern Health Board to prioritise the deployment of resources between the different aspects of the service such as training, equipment and fleet management.</P>
    <P>I am always anxious to ensure that the ambulance service responds effectively to the need of the public and in this context the Deputy will be interested to know that a value for money report on the emergency service carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General published in November 1997 reveals that the ambulance service in the Eastern Health Board region responded to 97 per cent of all emergency calls within 20 minutes of receipt. This response time was acknowledged as being the fastest response time of the eight health board regions. I will continue to support the development of the ambulance service to ensure that its capacity to meet the needs of the public is further strengthened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in April of this year the North-Western Health Board completed a review of cervical smears analysed on behalf of the board by a private laboratory. The board's review led them to suspect that a number of smears had been incorrectly read. The board contacted the women in question and these women have received satisfactory and appropriate medical follow-up. The chief executive officer commissioned consultants to carry out an independent investigation into the incident and their report is expected next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the expert advisory group which was set up to provide advice on the establishment of a national cervical screening programme is currently finalising quality assurance guidelines for <Col N="726" /> laboratories. This document which includes quality assurance targets for smeartakers, the laboratory and the colposcopy service will be circulated shortly. Preparations are currently under way in the Mid-Western Health Board to commence screening under phase one of the national cervical screening programme. This year the Mid-Western Health Board received £750,000 to cover the running costs of the project.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that screening of the target group, 67,000 women aged 25 to 60 years in the Mid-Western Health Board, will commence in early 2000. Following implementation of phase one and its evaluation, the programme will be extended to women in other health board areas.</P>
    <P>In addition to phase one of the national cervical screening programme, I have provided funding totalling approximately £1 million to a number of laboratories to ensure that they meet the standards required for participation in the national screening programme. I have also asked the expert advisory group to carry out a detailed examination of automated screening and its potential use in the Irish context.</P>

      <P>My Department has not issued guidelines regarding the retention of tissue following post-mortem examination for research or teaching purposes. I am, of course, aware that concern has been expressed about this matter in recent times and I would like to assure the Deputy that I share this concern.</P>
      <P>The professional body governing pathology, Faculty of Pathology, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, has been reviewing current consent arrangements for post-mortem examination and, in particular, the retention of tissue for further diagnoses, teaching and research. The faculty has recommended to its fellows that specific consent for retention of tissue for such purposes be sought for all post-mortem examinations. The faculty considers that it is essential to be explicit in relation to this issue and the nature and extent of the consent to be given will, therefore, form the basis for its ongoing consideration of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the recommendations of the faculty, which promotes and maintains the highest standards of post-mortem examinations practice, will guide all pathologists and their staff on this sensitive issue, thereby ensuring the post-<Col N="727" /> mortem examination continues to enjoy public support and be conducted in a manner in which the public has confidence.</P>

    <P>Since the publication of the report of the National Task Force on Suicide in 1998, there has been a positive and committed response among both the statutory and voluntary sectors towards finding ways of tackling this tragic problem.</P>
    <P>The suicide research group which has been established by the chief executive officers of the health boards is central to the strategy to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide. The group's main responsibilities include reviewing ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, co-ordinating research into suicide and making recommendations to the chief executive officers of health boards to help reverse the growing incidence of suicide. The group recognised the need for research/resource support to assist it in carrying out the tasks covered by the task force report and has now appointed a research co-ordinator to proceed with this important work.</P>
    <P>All health boards have appointed resource officers and have established multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the report. They are engaged in a range of activities including the promotion of positive mental health and the de-stigmatisation of suicide, provision of information in relation to suicide and parasuicide, liaison with the media and provision of training for staff in relation to suicide and parasuicide. Health boards are examining ways in which mental health services can be made more accessible to vulnerable groups, such as young males and the provision of crisis intervention services is being examined by a number of boards. Additional funding of £1.378 million has been provided in 1999 to further develop consultant led child and adolescent services which will assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour among young people and provide necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. Each health board now has dedicated child and adolescent psychiatric services headed by a consultant psychiatrist. It is my intention to further develop this service as resources permit.</P>
    <P>An important development in the education sector, which will promote self-esteem and self-confidence and enable students to develop personal and social skills, is the approval by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment of a social, personal and health education syllabus for primary schools and the junior cycle for post-primary schools. This programme has been developed by the Department of Education and Science in association with the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 40, 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>In February 1999, the Labour Court recommended significant improvements in existing allowances for nurses working in specialised areas and who hold special qualifications. The court also accepted that there are grounds for improvements in the pay of ward sisters and higher grades to reflect the new roles proposed for those grades in the Report of the Commission on Nursing. It recommended that the parties enter into immediate discussions on implementation of that report, with those discussions to be completed by 1 May 1999, at which stage the parties were to report back to the court.</P>
      <P>I announced on 10 February that the Government was prepared to accept those Labour Court recommendations. Discussions between the HSEA and the nursing unions began on 16 February and an intensive programme of talks was agreed. Difficulties arose when the direct discussions got under way on 25 February 1999 and the Labour Court decided to appoint a chairman to preside over the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Intensive discussions between the parties concluded at the end of March. While progress was made on the new roles envisaged for ward sisters and higher grades, there was no agreement on the pay issues. The chairman of the talks reported back to the Labour Court which met the parties again on 29 and 30 April 1999. In view of the complexity of the issues that have been referred back to it, the Labour Court arranged to meet the parties separately. The court met the health service employers on Thursday, 20 May and again in July and met the nursing unions on Tuesday 25 May.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Labour Court finding of 31 August 1999 rejected by nurses includes among other elements: (i) increases of 10 per cent for ward sister and other higher grades, (b) significant improvements in annual leave, an extra three days for staff nurses and an extra four days for promotional grades, (c) a lump sum of £1,250 for all nurses, contingent upon acceptance of the recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the latest Labour Court finding is <Col N="730" /> implemented, the maximum salary of ward sisters will have increased by over 37 per cent inclusive of general and special increases from £20,023 before the 1997 settlement. The maximum pay of staff nurses has increased over the same period by almost 26 per cent. Many staff nurses and a significant number of ward sisters also stand to benefit from substantial increases in location/specialist qualification allowances recommended by the court in February 1999.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court's finding represented the culmination of a lengthy negotiating process on nurses' pay and conditions that has taken four years to complete. The court itself acknowledged that, over the past two years, nurses have justifiably improved their position not just financially but in terms of gaining recognition for the enhanced role of the profession.</P>
    <P>The ongoing cost of the salary increases, enhanced annual leave and allowances rejected by nurses is in the region of £60 million. This, on top of the 1997 nurses' pay settlement which cost £85 million and other improvements in incremental credit and overtime already conceded, would result in an increased pay bill of over £150 million annually. The total additional cost in 1999 would be over £100 million because of the non-recurring cost of lump sums of £1,250 for each nurse and retrospection on allowances.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to reiterate that the Government is committed to paying the full terms of the Labour Court finding and as far as the Government is concerned that offer remains on the table. However, there is no possibility of improving upon the term of the Labour Court finding. The Government remains fully committed to implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing, which are designed to tackle the underlying problem within the profession and develop nursing as a key profession within the health services.</P>
    <P>Once again, I would ask all nurses to think carefully before voting for strike action. Not only is such action in direct breach of the industrial peace clause in Partnership 2000, it also endangers the entire national partnership approach, which has served the country so well. However, if nurses vote for industrial action, there is no avenue open to me to avert such action. All avenues have in fact been exhausted &ndash; in 1997 the Labour Court intervened to avert industrial action but on this occasion, nurses have rejected the Labour Court finding. There is nowhere else to go. The unfortunate fact is that if nurses vote for industrial action, an all-out strike beginning on 19 October is inevitable.</P>
    <P>No experience regarding the full implications of a national nurses' strike is available. The full range of health services is likely to be affected &ndash; including acute hospital services, community services such as nursing in the home, geriatric and long-stay hospital care. The extent to which the effects could be minimised will depend on agreement regarding the nature and extent of emergency cover.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> The Health Service Employers Agency is meeting with the alliance of nursing unions today to discuss the broad approach to ensuring that emergency and essential services will be maintained for the duration of the threatened strike. Management in all health agencies are currently drawing up detailed contingency plans for their own organisations. These will continue to be refined on the basis of discussions which will be held with local strike committees.</P>
    <P>My Department is in direct contact with all the affected agencies and is identifying in association with the HSEA all the high risk areas within the health service. Eight regional centres are being established to provide an ongoing flow of information on a daily basis to the Department in relation to service disruption, and to deal with communications with patients, impending patients and their families. A co-ordinated media information campaign in relation to the impact of the strike on the provision of services is being prepared.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Taoiseach outlined a credible alternative to confrontation and a way forward that will provide a better outcome for us all. That alternative is renewal of our commitment at national level to social partnership and a series of practical steps to a new partnership agreement. That national position must be combined with an approach to public service pay which is imaginative in ensuring that the income of public servants should more closely reflect their performance and not be based on so called traditional relativities. This is the approach to public service pay that the Taoiseach spelt out to the social partners in Dublin Castle in July 1998. Work on developing that approach has proceeded since then. That work must now be brought to a conclusion. This is the context within which the aims and aspirations of public servants, including nurses, can best be met.</P>

The service is a key element in the level one trauma service which is provided at Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>With regard to the future development needs of the service, the Southern Health Board has identified a third plastic surgery post as a priority and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have provided resources which have allowed this post to be filled in a locum capacity.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, and despite the many competing demands which are made on the resources available to my Department, I have consistently identified as one of my priorities the provision of additional residential, respite and day services for persons with an intellectual disability.</P>
      <P>This year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional funding of £1.2 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, for the further development of new services in line with the needs identified in the &ldquo;Assessment of Need&rdquo;. A sum of £10 million capital funding from the national capital programme has also been allocated to support the development of these new services, while £6 million has been provided to meet identified needs in existing services. This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>I am confident that within the context of the National Development Plan, and the Estimates for 2000 which are currently being finalised, I will be able to maintain and hopefully accelerate the pace of development and expansion of services. I intend to have discussions on this basis with the relevant interest groups involved over the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has quite rightly been a particular emphasis on the development of services to meet the needs of those awaiting placement in residential and day services, there is also a need to ensure that clients already in services receive an appropriate standard of care. While I have no plans at present to introduce a charter of rights as such, I am committed to the principles of equity, quality of services and accountability, and the concept of health and social gain which underpin <Col N="733" /> the health strategy as a whole, as well as to the development of services in accordance with the principles underpinning the United Nations Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with a Disability.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which these principles can be actively encouraged and maintained, and which have my full support. Service agreements are being developed between voluntary agencies and the health boards for the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability. These agreements will set out clearly the responsibilities of both parties and the principles which underpin those agreements, including the right to quality services.</P>
    <P>My Department is also working to develop evaluation tools and mechanisms which will enable us to evaluate and monitor various aspects of the services, and in particular the outcome for clients availing of the services. This has already commenced in the area of residential care, through the research study which is currently being undertaken on behalf of my Department, by the Centre for Study of Developmental Disabilities. It is my intention to initiate the commissioning of research into other areas of the services and particularly the area of day services.</P>
    <P>I was delighted earlier this year to launch the leaflet Standards of Care, produced by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, which outlines standards which should apply to the whole range of services provided by voluntary and statutory agencies for persons with an intellectual disability. I am also aware of the initiative taken by the federation of voluntary bodies providing services to people with mental handicap to identify a number of mechanisms which would assist service providers to measure quality standards within their services. My Department and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland were involved in this initiative.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> Under the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, the Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the regulatory control of medicinal products in Ireland. The Medicinal Products (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1998, which give effect to Council Directive 65/65/EEC, require that all medicinal products placed on the market must be the subject of a product authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board. The regulations also contain provisions for a simplified registration procedure for certain homeopathic medicines as required by Council Directive 92/73/EEC relating to homeopathic medicinal products. Before the board will grant an authorisation, it must first be satisfied as to the safety, quality and efficacy of the product concerned. In the case of unlicensed products, neither the safety, quality nor efficacy of such products would have been established.</P>
    <P>Directive 65/65/EEC defines a medicinal product as any substance or combination of substances for treating or preventing disease in humans or animals or which may be administered with a view to making a medical diagnosis or to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions. Neither the directive nor the regulations make any distinction between conventional medicines or so-called natural health products or remedies. At the same time, however, it is accepted that there are a range of products on the market which may, depending on circumstances, be classified as either food supplements or medicinal products. For example, certain products such as vitamin or mineral supplements which may sometimes be regarded as food supplements, are sometimes presented at therapeutic dosage levels supported by specific medicinal claims. Indeed, it is recognised that certain vitamins and minerals can have serious side effects if taken in excessive doses.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board recently published guidelines on the interpretation of the definition of a medicinal product as set out in the council directive. These guidelines revise and update similar guidelines published by my Department in 1988. I am aware concerns expressed both by consumers and by the organisation referred to regarding the possible application of the guidelines. However, I would like to assure the Deputies that it is neither mine nor the board's intention or desire to in any way interfere with the rights of individuals to avail of those medicines which they may wish to use. However, at the same time, it is generally accepted that, in the interest of consumer health and protection, some form of regulation of alternative medicines is desirable and, indeed, this is supported in principle by the health food and alternative medicines industry. In this respect, the European Commission is currently considering what controls, if any, should be applied to health food products and natural medicines, including the possibility of providing simplified procedures for the licensing of alternative or traditional medicines, but has yet <Col N="735" /> to bring forward any definitive proposals in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he is taking to ensure the target set out in the national breastfeeding policy that 30 per cent of mothers should be breastfeeding at four months by the year 2000; the number of recommendations implemented to date; the number outstanding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of factors influence the success or otherwise of implementing the national breastfeeding policy. However, in prioritising the recommendations and how they might be implemented it was recognised that the support of health professionals would be critical to its successful implementation as they are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and are ideally placed to ensure the mother receives information about the benefits of breastfeeding in order that she can make an informed choice. Consequently, the National University of Ireland, Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit of my Department, has produced a training pack for health professional which includes a breastfeeding video and information booklets. This pack was developed in conjunction with An Board Altranais and is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers with breastfeeding. This training pack is now in place and available to the relevant health professional bodies.</P>
      <P>Another key recommendation of the national breastfeeding policy was that Ireland participate in the baby friendly hospital initiative. This global campaign, led by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF encourages hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed. The initiative has recently been established in Ireland and the number of hospitals, maternity and paediatric units involved in the initiative continues to grow.</P>
      <P>My Department through the health promotion unit also continues to be involved in ensuring that the other recommendations of the national breastfeeding policy are implemented. Other initiatives undertaken to achieve this include the production of materials encouraging breastfeeding and supporting voluntary organisations such as La Leche League, Cuidiu (Irish Childbirth Trust) and the Association of Lactation Consultants, to further promote the incidence of breastfeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I recognise that the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland remains low, the health promotion unit is committed to continue its support for the implementation of the recommendations <Col N="736" /> of the national breastfeeding policy. I am confident that the continuing implementation of the recommendations and particularly the growing participation in the baby friendly hospital initiative will result in an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding in this country.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a shortage of social workers in the health service and a number of actions are being taken to address this.</P>
      <P>I have arranged for the continuation of funding to the Higher Education Authority for extra student intake to social work courses in UCD and TCD. The extent of the shortage of social workers and the difficulty with recruitment and retention are being investigated as part of the remit of the expert group on paramedical grades, which includes social workers. The National Social Work Qualifications Board is currently carrying out a national survey of employers, which among other things is seeking to identify the extent and nature of any recruitment problems with social workers in the health service. The board will advise my Department of the results of this study. I will arrange for appropriate action to be taken in conjunction with the educational authorities when these investigations have been completed.</P>

      <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.26 million is being provided by the health boards towards the service in 1999. The number of places currently funded is 7,000 approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards have indicated that it is difficult to give details of additional child care places funded since January 1999 as the pre-school term commences in September each year and because funding from a number of the boards is provided by way of grant aid, lottery <Col N="737" /> funding or direct funding to service providers to enable them to provide a pre-school service rather than for the funding of individual pre-school places.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Partnership 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, examined the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a child care infrastructure including the financing and resourcing implications of its implementation. The report of the group was launched on 3 February 1999. The Government established an interdepartmental committee on child care chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to evaluate, cost and prioritise the proposals in the report and the child care proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the report of the Commission on the Family and the report of the Forum on Early Childhood Education. The report of the committee has been noted by Government who have referred the report for consideration to a ministerial group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of this special provision I do not feel it justifiable, nor did previous Governments on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means as a <Col N="738" /> general rule. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Non-medical holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the drug payments scheme, a person and his or her dependants does not have to pay more than £42 in any calendar month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and appliances.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out on the following tables, in the format collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the waiting list figures at the end of June 1999 show a reduction of 1,072 on the March figures. This means that waiting lists have fallen by almost 3,000, some 8 per cent since the beginning of this year. The reductions in March and June 1999 are the first since December 1996.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies who achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>
      <P>I also allocated £9 million to services to older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services, with the aim of freeing acute hospital beds by ensuring the streamlining of emergency services and providing additional step-down and rehabilitation facilities for older people.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represents the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 46 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes were merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit on 1 July. This scheme represents the best elements of the previous schemes. For example, the drug payment scheme is more user friendly than the drug refund scheme and is designed to improve the cash flow situation for families. Unlike the drug cost subsidisation scheme, there are no qualifying criteria for the new scheme. Payment thresholds for the drug refund scheme and the drug cost subsidisation scheme were £90 per quarter and £32 per month respectively. With regard to the increase in the threshold for the new scheme, I would point out that there had been no increases in the previous thresholds since 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced by the GMS scheme and the new drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. Previously, medicines which were not available to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme &ndash; generally <Col N="743" /> over the counter items such as cough bottles, vitamins etc. were reimbursable under the drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes.</P>
    <P>To facilitate a more equitable system, the list of drugs, medicines and appliances available to GMS patients as specified in the current GMS code book, including all updates, now forms the common list of items for both the GMS and the new drugs payment scheme. Products available on the common list must meet a set of criteria which include requirements on the uses for and licensing of medicines and also that the products should not be advertised or promoted to the public. It is not possible in this forum to go into detail about all drugs but if there is an inquiry about a particular drug I would be happy to forward the Deputy specific information on why it is no longer reimbursable.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the common list provides a comprehensive range of the most modern therapies and I would add that this common list is subject to ongoing review and is updated on a monthly basis.</P>

      <P>A report of the review of the role of the three Dublin children's hospitals in the delivery and organisation of paediatric services was presented to my Department in 1998. This report contained a number of proposals, one of which was the setting up of a joint council comprising members of the three hospitals which would identify specific actions needed to facilitate necessary change and development. Dr. Helen Burke has been appointed to chair the new Council for Children's Hospital Care and the first meeting of the council has recently taken place. My Department has provided the necessary funding to support the council's establishment and will continue to liaise closely with the council in the early stages of its establishment.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons on hospital waiting lists when he was appointed; the number of persons currently on hospital waiting lists; and the reason for these waiting list numbers in view of the resources available.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 30 June, 1997 there were 30,453 persons on waiting lists for in-patient hospital treatments. The corresponding figure on 30 June, 1999 was 33,924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waiting lists have however fallen by almost 3,000 or by 8 per cent, since the beginning of this <Col N="744" /> year, due primarily to the structured, planned and integrated approach which I have taken to address the question of unduly long waiting times and waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The performance of the waiting list initiative in the latter half of 1997 was heavily influenced by the funding allocated by the previous Government. As only £8 million had been allocated for 1997 before I took office, waiting lists increased to over 32,200 by the end of that year. I increased the funding for waiting list procedures to £12 million in 1998 and to £20 million in 1999, an increase of some 150 per cent over the 1997 allocation given by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The reasons for waiting lists are many, including the ever-increasing demand for health care; the tendency for new cases to be added to lists as soon as a significant number of patients have been treated; and a range of underlying causes such as questions of capacity, staffing, equipment, management of hospital facilities, and availability of step-down care.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I have adopted a co-ordinated approach to addressing both waiting lists and waiting times. This has involved establishing the first ever formal review of the waiting list initiative and, since receiving its report, implementing its recommendations systematically; progressively increasing the dedicated funding available directly for waiting list procedures &ndash; from £8 million in 1997 to £20 million in 1999; and allocating funding to related areas to help free up acute hospital beds for elective work. In 1999 I allocated an extra £9 million to services for older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services in areas that will help reduce the pressure on acute hospital facilities.</P>
    <P>As a result of this approach, waiting lists have begun to fall since the beginning of the year. The reduction in June represented the first time that waiting list figures have declined in two successive quarters since the end of December, 1996. There are no simple solutions to the issue of waiting lists; they are a feature of health systems throughout the world. While the gains to date have been modest, I am satisfied that the integrated approach I am taking will pay dividends. I will not be diverted from my approach by sensationalist or simplistic claims about waiting lists; the policy I have set out has received broad support from health agencies and I am determined to pursue it to ensure the best long-term benefit for patients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's records of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Ireland date from 1980. In the period from 1980 to date, 31 persons have contracted the disease. In each case the patient died. One of the cases, which occurred in 1999, involved new variant CJD.</P>
      <P>The CJD advisory group was established in 1996 to advise the Minister for Health and Children on CJD-related matters including surveillance, research strategies and international developments generally in relation to this disease, and to provide advice on particular issues referred to the group from time to time by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The advisory group is comprised of experts in neurology, neuropathology, public health, veterinary medicine and microbiology. My Department is also represented.</P>
      <P>To establish the true incidence of CJD and to determine any changes in the pattern and-or nature of its occurrence, a national surveillance system has been established and is based at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. The objectives of this project are to build a database of information on CJD cases in Ireland and to provide a facility to medical practitioners for the verification of suspected cases of the disease.</P>
      <P>Ireland also participates in the European surveillance programme on CJD.</P>

      <P>New national guidelines entitled &ldquo;Children First &ndash; National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children&rdquo; were published on 21 September 1999. The Government has agreed that these national guidelines will be applied consistently by all health boards, Government Departments and organisations providing services to children.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the guidelines will take some time and will require careful planning and co-ordination. My officials are liaising closely with health board management in this regard. An implementation group at health board level has been established and plans are under way to develop the implementation strategy necessary for the successful integration of the new guidelines into the day to day operations of the boards.</P>
      <P>I have also recently sanctioned an additional post for the social services inspectorate. One of the main functions of this inspector will be to monitor the implementation of Children First at health board level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The successful implementation of the guidelines will require development of a number of services, in particular training of relevant staff, establishment of the child protection notification system and a comprehensive computerised infor<Col N="746" /> mation system in all health boards, continued strengthening of child protection services to ensure a prompt and thorough response to child protection concerns, establishment of a 24-hour duty system in health boards, and expansion of family support services.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to implementing the guidelines including the strengthening of child protection services as outlined. The requirement for funding in year 2000 is being discussed in the context of the 2000 Estimates.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are also at present identifying additional funding requirements for the implementation of the guidelines in relation to the training of teachers and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Beginning in 1993, my Department developed a voluntary code of practice in relation to smoking in the workplace, following consultation and agreement with staff representative bodies. Subsequently, from 6 April 1999, all of my Department's offices became no-smoking areas, including single occupancy rooms and restaurant facilities.</P>
      <P>A voluntary code on smoking in the workplace was developed by the health promotion unit of my Department with the support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation and the Health and Safety Authority. The code is included in a booklet titled Working Together for Cleaner Air and was distributed to over 5,000 companies, including other Government Departments, in late 1994. This code encourages a consensual approach to smoking control policies through a consultation process between staff and management interests.</P>

At that time I announced that I was setting up a heart health task force and an independent advisory forum on cardiovascular health to drive the process forward. These groups have been set up and both have held their first meeting. A major national conference is planned for 5 November where the recommendations of the report will be discussed in detail with all organisations involved in its planned implementation.</P>
      <P>With regard to nicotine replacement therapies, I agree with the recommendation in the report that there is a role for NRT as part of the overall fight against smoking. I have asked the advisory forum to bring forward proposals on how we can prioritise NRT for medical card users as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>Existing consumer legislation sets standards for tanning equipment and requires appropriate warning notices to be displayed on the equipment.</P>
      <P>The advice given by the Department of Health and Children is that sunbeds should be used in moderation and that people should seek the advice of their family doctor before doing so for the first time. In certain circumstances exposure to sunbeds may constitute a hazard. Sunbeds should not be used by children under 18, persons who burn easily or tan poorly, those taking drugs or cosmetics thought to be photoactive, those suffering from skin disorders induced or aggravated by exposure to sunlight, those with a history of skin cancer and those with risk factors for cutaneous melanoma. A consumer information sheet on possible risks from tanning equipment and the appropriate precautions to take is available to the public from the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
      <P>Sunbeds are widely used in beauty salons by beauty therapists who offer cosmetic tanning as part of their services. Guidelines on the use of sunbeds in beauty salons were drawn up by the Society of Applied Cosmetology which represents beauty therapists. These guidelines incorporate advice from the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Cancer Society on appropriate precautions to be taken by sunbed operators to protect the health of clients.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce legislation banning the use of sunbeds. However, I will shortly be publishing a proposal for a national environmental health action plan. This plan will, I believe, offer a possible framework for empowering health boards to introduce local rules in matters such as this.</P>

      <P>Figures available to my Department indicate that on average 47 beds were temporarily closed each month for the first eight months of the year as a result of staffing shortages, including nurse shortages. In addition to those closures which were undertaken as a direct result of staffing shortages, there would be further closures where nursing shortages may be one of a number of contributory factors in a decision to temporarily close beds. Other factors may include annual leave, refurbishment works and decisions in relation to the scheduling of planned elective activity within the annual service plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent survey of nursing vacancies, <Col N="749" /> carried out by the Health Service Employers Agency &ndash; HSEA &ndash; related to the position at the end of April 1999 and found that there were 566staff nurse vacancies. I have asked the HSEA to carry out a further study of the position at 30 September 1999.</P>
    <P>The principal difficulties relating to the recruitment and retention of nurses are concentrated in the Dublin area. While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the country, investment in hospitals and the development of regional specialties over recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area. Within Dublin, issues such as housing costs, traffic problems and lack of car parking facilities have been cited as disincentives to the recruitment and retention of nurses. However, these issues are not unique to nurses or to the health service.</P>
    <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, who take their own initiatives in this regard, a range of initiatives have been taken or are being progressed with a view to stabilising the situation and, where possible, improving it. These initiatives include the following: arrangements have been agreed with the nursing unions to allow more favourable assimilation arrangements on to pay scales for nurses taking up both permanent and temporary appointments. A significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units is being introduced. Implementation of these increased allowances is subject to a satisfactory resolution of the current nurses' pay dispute. Discussions with the nursing unions are continuing in relation to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. Standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions. Health service employers have been asked to examine the possibilities in relation to the introduction of term time working as an option for staff with family commitments. The availability of return to working courses for qualified nurses who have been out of the work force is being reviewed with a view to maximising uptake. The Department of Health and Children is currently engaged in discussions with health agencies in relation to the provision of specialist nursing courses at centres outside Dublin. An anti-bullying policy has been prepared and agreed with the nursing unions and is due to be published shortly. The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the commission on nursing. A &ldquo;Study of the Nursing and Midwifery Resource&rdquo; by the nursing policy division of the Department of Health and Children commenced last year with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs.</P>
    <P>With regard to attracting applicants to study nursing, almost £400,000 was allocated this year to underpin a recruitment campaign, at both local and national level. This was a success as more than 5,500 applications were received this year, <Col N="750" /> an increase of over 40 per cent on the 1998 figure. The annual maintenance grant for nursing students, which is not subject to a means test, has been increased from £2,500 to £3,250 since 1997. The grant now is almost double the maximum grant for which other third level students may qualify. The range of leaving certificate subjects that may be presented by an applicant for admission to the nursing diploma programme has been expanded. The requirement to have a foreign language in the leaving certificate has been removed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the changes outlined above, together with the national and local recruitment campaigns which I funded, have resulted in a highly successful outcome to this year's competitions for training places on the nursing diploma programmes. A total of 1,217 training places have been filled: 819 in general nursing, 242 in psychiatric nursing and 156 in mental handicap nursing. This is the largest number of direct entrants to nurse training for several years and proves that there continues to be considerable interest among young people and others in nursing as a career.</P>
    <P>As mentioned previously, I provided funding of almost £400,000 for the recruitment campaigns and I regard it as money well spent. I am especially pleased that the promotional campaigns have raised the profile of both psychiatric and mental handicap nursing. This year we succeeded in filling a record 242 training places in psychiatric nursing compared with only 92 places last year, and a record 156 places in mental handicap nursing compared with 117 in 1998. I also made available funding for some 100 extra training places in general and psychiatric nursing this year and these have been offered to applicants who successfully came through the competition.</P>

      <P>The provision of renal dialysis at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. A new dialysis unit was opened there in March 1997, catering for 32 patients per week as part of the major capital development at the hospital. In 1998 I approved additional funding of £200,000 to enable the hospital to provide a service to further patients that required dialysis as demand for the service grew. As a result, a total of 42 patients are now attending the unit each week.</P>
      <P>I am aware that further demand for access to this service exists and my Department will continue to work with the South-Eastern Health Board in identifying and addressing the board's overall service development needs. In this regard, expansion of dialysis services will continue to be considered in the context of the board's competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The basic working week of all non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, is 39 hours. However, they are liable to be rostered to work up to an average of 65 hours per week. The 65 hour week was implemented in 1989 following a Labour Court recommendation and in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation which represents the interests of NCHDs. A mechanism has been introduced to monitor and control working hours of NCHDs as part of the revised terms and conditions of the NCHD contract of employment effective from 1 January, 1997. The first stage of the mechanism was introduced on 1 July, 1995 and the complete four stage mechanism, to resolve any breach of the Labour Court recommendation, has been in place since 1 January, 1997. I am not aware that there has been any use made of this mechanism to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that trainee doctors, along with several other groups, were excluded from the provisions of the original working time directive adopted by the EU in 1993. Following adoption of the 1993 directive the European Commission embarked on a consultative exercise with the sectors concerned and the member states on how a broadly similar level of protection to that provided by the 1993 directive, could be afforded to the excluded groups while taking account of the specific requirements of the industries and services concerned. In the case of <Col N="752" /> hospitals this involved attempting to balance the need for reasonable working hours for doctors while recognising the 24 hour nature of hospital services and the need to guarantee continuity of care for patients. In Ireland's case we needed a framework which would allow us to move from our present position of having a maximum working week of 65 hours for junior doctors to the 48 hours contained in the 1993 directive. Following the consultative process, the European Commission published its proposals for an amending directive to the 1993 directive. These proposals involve a total transition period of 13 years with a gradual reduction in the maximum weekly working hours to 48 hours over the period.</P>
    <P>The 65 hour week was introduced in 1989-90 at considerable cost resulting in the recruitment at the time of over 400 additional doctors. The number of junior doctors has continued to grow since then. This growth has resulted in a serious imbalance between the number of these trainee posts and the number of consultant posts. I established the medical manpower forum to address this and associated medical manpower issues. The forum is taking full account of the need to reduce working hours in its deliberations. However, we have to be realistic in how we approach this complex problem. What we have sought from these negotiations is a practical framework to implement the 48 hour week. I believe that we now have a set of proposals which will allow us to reduce doctors' hours in an orderly and progressive fashion without jeopardising standards of patient care or damaging young doctors' reasonable career expectations.</P>
    <P>What was agreed at the Council meeting on 25 May 1999 is being considered by the European Parliament. The eventual final content of the directive is a matter for negotiation between the Council and the Parliament. I do not believe that we need to await the final outcome of the EU's deliberations on the draft directive to begin to put in place the preparatory process required to implement the primary provisions of the legislation. In that regard it is necessary to establish the facts on the ground. Accordingly, it has been agreed between representatives from my Department, the Health Service Employers Agency and the Irish Medical Organisation that a study should be undertaken which would look at the hours worked by NCHDs. The study will be overseen by a joint steering group. The steering group will be chaired by Mr. David Hanly, a former chairman of Comhairle na nOspideal. When the findings of the study and the outcome of the medical manpower forum's deliberations are available, it is intended to reach agreement on how to reduce NCHD working hours in a manner that benefits doctors and patients. In the meantime, I would hope that precipitated action would not be taken by NCHDs that would jeopardise this consensus approach.</P>

      <P>Since 1997, my Department has been working with health agencies to ensure year 2000 compliance in the health service. My Department has undertaken an overall role of co-ordinating, assisting, facilitating the sharing of information and monitoring progress. Each health agency has its own year 2000 project structure in place and the year 2000 remediation programme is now drawing to a close. I have authorised expenditure amounting to approximately £25 million for the repair or replacement of non-compliant systems and equipment.</P>
      <P>Returns from agencies show that the bulk of the technical remedial work is now complete. However, year 2000 compliance is a complex issue in a health care setting. It involves making all reasonable efforts to ensure that systems and equipment will continue to function normally and adequate contingency plans are put in place as an added assurance. It is also necessary to continue to make staff aware of the issues and this awareness training will continue right up to the millennium changeover itself. Another important aspect of year 2000 preparations in the health service involves planning for the possible increased demand for services over the period. Accordingly, major hospitals were not in a position to complete all preparations by July 1999.</P>
      <P>My objectives are to ensure that there is no risk to the health and safety of health service clients and staff and that there is minimal disruption to normal services. I am confident that these objectives will be achieved.</P>

      <P>The number of new AIDS cases reported to my Department from January 1999 to 31 July 1999 was 32. In the six months preceding this, from June 1998 to December 1998, the number of cases of AIDS reported was three. However, it should be noted that the figure for AIDS cases reported to the Department from January 1998 to June 1998 was 38, with a full year total of 41. This shows that there has not been a significant increase in the overall reported incidence of AIDS. Statistics on AIDS and HIV are produced bi-annually by my Department with the statistics on AIDS cases reflecting the number of cases reported in a given period and not when the onset of AIDS occurred.</P>
      <P>The incidence of AIDS has declined in all EU countries. This is due, at least partly, to the impact of highly active anti-retroviral treatments which were introduced in 1996. These treatments slow down the progression of the disease, hence people infected with HIV do not develop AIDS as quickly as before. However, in some cases patients do not respond to the new treatment regimes and therefore we can expect that a number of new cases of AIDS are likely to occur each year.</P>
      <P>Of course, this means that we must not become complacent about this condition and my Department will continue to give priority to HIV and AIDS. For this reason the national AIDS strategy committee is undertaking a review of all aspects of HIV-AIDS, with the aim of publishing an updated strategy in December 1999.</P>

    <P>This year, a total of £3 million &ndash; with a full year cost of £6 million in the year 2000 &ndash; was provided for the health boards for the development of services in their functional area. From this funding, a sum of £300,000 &ndash; with a full year cost of £600,000 &ndash; was provided for the South-Eastern Health Board to allocate, in consultation with its co-ordinating committee, on agreed priority developments for people with physical and sensory disabilities. The South-Eastern Health Board, in consultation with its co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services, is in the process of finalising allocations for development funding.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the recruitment of paramedical staff generally is presenting problems throughout the health board regions. Following a Labour Court recommendation in 1997, an expert group was established to examine and report on various issues relating to paramedical grades, including speech and language therapists. Among the issues to be examined by this group are the problems which arise in relation to the recruitment and the retention of various paramedical grades. It is expected that the expert group will issue its report before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Roaccutane (isotretinoin) is a vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of acne. In Ireland, it is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board for the treatment of severe acne, unresponsive to other treatments, and its availability is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a specialist dermatologist. I am aware that there have been reports in the past of possible adverse reactions to the drug, including reports of possible suicides linked to its usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has in the past, and continues on an ongoing basis, to actively monitor all available data on Roaccutane, including reports of adverse reactions, which it reviews both internally with its own experts and with the other European regulatory agencies. In addition, the board has also recently reviewed the terms of the authorisation for the product with the company. As a result of this, revised wording for inclusion in the prescribing information for the product, outlining the current position regarding its use and warnings related to the possible development of psychiatric reactions was agreed. <Col N="756" /> The warnings refer to possible side effects, including depression, psychotic symptoms and of rare reports of suicide associated with Roaccutane. The revised warnings have been incorporated into the authorisation documents for the product and the company has circularised all physicians and pharmacists outlining the new warnings regarding the use of Roaccutane. In addition revised warnings have also been provided for in the package labelling and patient information leaflets.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the board continues to actively monitor the safety profile of the product and I am assured that it will take any action that may be necessary having regard to the risk-benefit ratios relating to the product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need to develop better health and other support services for older people is regarded as a priority by this Government and is reflected in the significant increase in the allocation for this service. An additional £25 million has been allocated in 1999 which is being used to support older people in their homes, as well as improving hospital based services for older people.</P>
      <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People, which is the statutory advisory body on services for older people, has identified support for older people in the home, as well as support for carers, as fundamental to improving the quality of life for older people. This is also the consensus view of the various organisations which represent the interests of older people. Accordingly, a number of initiatives have been taken which will enable health boards to provide greater support for older people in their homes.</P>
      <P>Additional resources amounting to £4.5 million were provided this year for the home help service. This allocation is being used to extend the coverage of the service by providing more hours, as well as improving rates of payment for home helps.</P>
      <P>A sum of £1 million has been allocated this year to the health boards specifically for the support of carers through the employment of liaison officers and the provision of respite breaks. Additional funding has been allocated for the recruitment of more paramedical and nursing staff to be assigned to home care of older people which, in turn, will also assist carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While support of older people in the home is a very important part of Government policy in relation to the care of older people, there will continue to be a need for residential nursing care, when it is no longer possible for older people to be looked after at home. The budget allocation for older people will enable a number of new community nursing units to be opened this year, <Col N="757" /> as well as the increased use of private nursing home places. A sum of almost £10 million has been provided to meet increased demands on the private nursing home subvention scheme and the contracting of additional beds in private nursing homes. These initiatives, together with the improvement of community support services, will help to alleviate the pressure on acute beds in the major general hospitals by providing more appropriate convalescent, extended care and home support services. The package of measures also includes the further improvement of the specialist psychiatry of older age services, specialist assessment units for older people in general hospitals and improved staffing in extended care and day care facilities for older people, as well as support for voluntary groups which represent the interests of older people.</P>
    <P>The importance of encouraging older people to seek medical intervention at the earliest possible stage has been recognised by the significant increase in the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 and over.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to further develop services for older people along these lines as resources permit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 97 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March of this year, agreement was reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on a one-off arrangement for entry to the GMS scheme by doctors who met certain requirements, particularly as regards experience and qualifications. In essence, the agreement allowed for limited GMS scheme entry for doctors having five years full-<Col N="758" /> time general practice experience. Those doctors would be in a position to retain any of their private patients, who after 1 March 1999, obtained a medical card. Doctors with eight years relevant experience would be able to apply for full GMS scheme contracts. They could take on any person having a medical card. For the sake of completeness, I should point out that a limited contract holder would, after accumulating the required eight years experience, also become eligible for a full contract.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to be specific about the total number of doctors who will ultimately benefit from and take advantage of these arrangements over the relevant timeframe which concludes at 28 February 2007. For example, some doctors who are eligible to apply for GMS scheme entry under the scheme may decide not to do so. However, it is thought that approximately 300 doctors may come within the scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the implementation of the agreement, the terms of the agreement required significant elaboration before they could be implemented. This involved further discussions with the IMO aimed at mutually agreed clarification of terms as well as consultations with the health boards on the practical steps that would be required for the processing of applications.</P>
    <P>This process culminated in late July with the production of a uniform national application package consisting of application forms, notes for applicants and interpretation of key terms. Health boards were only then in a position to formally process applications.</P>
    <P>In terms of the time taken to process individual applications, applicants are required to provide, <i>inter alia, </i>documentary evidence of qualifications and experience which may require to be verified, to nominate referees who have to be contacted and forward written references, to provide details of practice premises which may require inspection. The Deputy will appreciate that this matter must be handled with appropriate rigour in the interests of the patients.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the time expended by all the parties referred to above in teasing out the operational aspects of the agreement was a necessary requirement if the arrangements were not to operate in a haphazard, <i>ad hoc</i> and ultimately unsatisfactory manner. I am satisfied that we now have a satisfactory procedure in place.</P>
    <P>I understand that the first contracts under these arrangements will be issued in the next week or so. My Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that the procedures operate as effectively and efficiently as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. The current uptake of MMR &ndash; measles-mumps-rubella &ndash; vaccine nationally is approximately 77 per cent, while the target uptake is 95 per cent. This is a cause for concern and my Department has drawn the attention of the health boards to the potential for a measles epidemic. The need to achieve further improvements in immunisation uptake for this and other primary childhood vaccinations has also been stressed to the boards.</P>
      <P>The structure of the primary childhood immunisation programme is based on the recommendations of the 1994 report of the review group on primary childhood immunisation, which stated that the general practitioner was ideally placed to administer the immunisation service and should be the principal health professional involved in its delivery. There are no plans to change the structure of the immunisation programme, which already includes a provision whereby health boards may make special arrangements where the uptake of immunisation among particular groups or in geographical areas is unacceptably low.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to address concerns which have been expressed in some quarters in relation to the MMR vaccine. My Department has reviewed the available evidence and is satisfied that this is a very safe and effective vaccine. There is no evidence to support any link between the MMR vaccine and the subsequent development either of chronic inflammatory bowel disease or of autism. Neither is there evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccine. While the situation continues to be monitored, two recently published British studies have further confirmed that the MMR vaccine has not been linked to the development of the conditions mentioned. I would, therefore, urge all parents to ensure that their children receive the MMR vaccine, which may be given from the age of 15 months and which is available free of charge from their family doctor.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment for eligible persons in the Southern Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board. The board is concerned at the very large number of children on the waiting list for both assessment and treatment of orthodontic conditions. Currently patients who were placed on the waiting list in August 1996 are being called and in 1998 over 1,200 patients commenced orthodontic treatment but the annual requirement is for 1,500-1,600 patients per year.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the board appointed a registrar and senior registrar to the orthodontic department. The registrar is involved in the treatment of 250-300 patients per annum while the senior registrar has recently taken up a position as consultant orthodontist in the Cork University Dental School.</P>
      <P>The employment of the registrar has enabled the board to commence orthodontic clinics in Bantry on two days per week and to increase the clinics in Tralee to three days per week.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board has proposals to contract with University Dental Hospital on site at Cork University Hospital for treatment of orthodontic patients from the board's waiting lists and for the Dental Hospital to work more closely with the board's own orthodontic service. This will help to ease waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the review group on orthodontics provides the basis for discussions between my Department and health boards on the further development of orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>It is expected that the third ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation, scheduled to be held in Seattle from 30 November to 3 December 1999, will take the necessary decisions to launch a millennium round of trade negotiations in the WTO in 2000.</P>
      <P>The European Union has been, and is, engaged in the detailed work, within the WTO, preparing for these negotiations. Ireland has participated fully in the preparation of EU positions.</P>
      <P>The EU is firmly convinced that a comprehensive trade round, involving a broad range of issues is the best way to address the challenges resulting from rapid and far-reaching economic changes, to manage properly and effectively the globalisation process, to promote equitable growth and development and to respond in a balanced manner to the interests of all WTO members, in particular the developing countries.</P>
      <P>Eight rounds of trade liberalisation and strengthening of multilateral trade rules have made a major contribution to global prosperity, development and rising living standards. Since 1951, global trade has grown seventeenfold, world production has more than quadrupled, and world <i>per capita</i> income has doubled. The multilateral system has helped a large number of developing countries to successfully integrate into the international economy and developing countries' share of world export trade has increased by nearly 50 per cent over the past three years.</P>
      <P>The WTO, since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, has brought about major improvements in market access and more predictable rules that have benefited the membership as a whole, in particular smaller countries. Over the period 1995-97, the volume of global trade increased by almost 8 per cent annually, far outpacing the growth in GNP. WTO and OECD studies on the impact of the Uruguay Round have confirmed the positive impact on the world economy as its results are taking effect.</P>
      <P>In addition to a decision to launch a new round of trade negotiations, I would hope that the Seattle ministerial meeting will take decisions that will strengthen the WTO as an institution. These could include improvements to the dispute settlement understanding, the creation of an institutional basis to better address development concerns, the improvement of co-operation between the WTO and other major international institutions and improved procedures to create greater transparency and public awareness of the WTO.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I advised the Deputy in writing on 20 May 1999, agreement was reached between the Drogheda Port Company and the Mornington Fishermen's Association representing mussel fishermen, and confirmed and supported by the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, to provide compensation for loss of earnings arising from the dredging works; a post-dredge mussel bed reseeding programme; and compensation for loss in livelihood should the reseeding fail.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that the extraction of mussels would stop for a period of four years to allow the rejuvenation of the mussel beds after reseeding. Mussel fishing may commence before the end of the four year period if expert opinion indicates that the mussel beds are replenished. The level of compensation payable by the Drogheda Port Company to the mussel fishermen for loss of earnings during this period is based on annual mussel catch of 500 tons at £140 per ton, which is £70,000 per annum. The first £70,000 has already been made available for draw down by the fishermen.</P>
      <P>The agreement provided for the appointment of an independent arbitrator who assisted in the calculation and disbursement of compensation moneys. The arbitrator was also available to meet any mussel fishermen who wished to make a case.</P>
      <P>Prior to the completion of the mussel bed restoration and in satisfaction of clause 13 of the foreshore licence, the port company is required to lodge and maintain a bond to the value of £420,000 which will be executed in favour of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. The bond will be sufficient to capitalise payments to mussel fishermen for losses in livelihood as a result of the dredging should the mussel beds not be returned to current levels of productivity.</P>
      <P>With regard to the physical aspect of the mussel beds reseeding, a shellfish expert has been engaged by the port company to implement the reseeding programme after dredging takes place. These arrangements will be overseen and monitored by the Mornington Fishermen's Association, the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board and the Drogheda Port Company.</P>
      <P>If any mussel fisherman is aware of some evidence that leads him to believe that the mussel beds will not rejuvenate to their former productivity, I am assured by the chief executive of Drogheda Port Company, that he would be pleased to arrange a meeting with the company's shellfish expert to advise on his concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reply of 20 May to the Deputy's previous representations covered the points raised by the <Col N="765" /> Deputy in his further representations of July. I regret, however, that a second reply did not issue.</P>
    <P>I can also advise the Deputy that earlier this month the Drogheda Port Company provided both the Boyne net fishermen and the Mornington Fishermen's Association with details of the controls that will be placed on the dredging contractor to avoid unreasonable disruption to salmon netting operations and undue interference with fishing-landing stations.</P>
    <P>I am advised that Drogheda Port Company has given a commitment to ensure that there will be no material reduction in the banks for hauling of nets and it is willing to give assistance with net depth adjustment if requested.</P>
    <P>If the individual concerned has difficulty with any of the details of the agreement referred to he should contact either the Mornington Fishermen's Association or the Drogheda Port Company.</P>

      <P>When airlines use sub contractors to provide groundhandling services, it is the airlines' responsibility in the first instance to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the standards, procedures, equipment and training of the service <Col N="766" /> provider. In Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority is the regulatory body responsible for the safety and technical aspects of civil aviation and it monitors the activities of airlines in this regard.</P>
      <P>Where the provision of groundhandling services does not impinge on aircraft safety, such as catering supplies or aircraft cabin cleaning services, it is the responsibility of the existing agencies such as the regional health board's environmental health service for food safety, the Health and Safety Authority for safe work practices and the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the legal standards in the same manner as for any other industrial activity or service in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan, <Col N="767" /> 1996-1998, which was approved by Government in March 1996 provides for a special study of the reserve defence force, which consists of the first line reserve made up of former members of the Permanent Defence Force, An Fóras Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November 1997, I announced the setting up of a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process the chief of staff established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. Part of the function of the joint civilian-military steering group was to oversee and guide the military board in its task. The steering group recently completed its examination and submitted a draft report which I am currently in the process of examining.</P>
      <P>The question of members of the reserve defence force serving overseas was included in the terms of reference of the special study of the reserve and pending more detailed examination of the steering group's report, it would be premature for members of the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association to visit overseas missions.</P>

      <P>The position is that when the disadvantaged areas appeals panel was commencing its examination of areas for reclassification in 1992 it was decided, following agreement with farming organisations, that the panel would base its recommendations on data gathered in survey conducted in 1989.</P>
      <P>This data had been used in the previous, fourth, review to select areas for reclassification, based on an income criterion of &ldquo;less than 40 per cent of national average income&rdquo;, with at least 40 per cent of the working population being engaged in agriculture.</P>
      <P>It was agreed that if the income limit was raised to 60 per cent and the working population limit was disregarded, then the data would allow selection of a significant number of additional areas. A further condition was that the land must be rated at four or lower on a quality scale of zero to nine and also that selected areas must adjoin existing more severely handicapped areas.</P>
      <P>Using these criteria, the appeals panel selected an additional 30 per cent of Monaghan for reclassification as more severely handicapped, and this was approved by the EU Commission in November 1995, bringing the total more severely handicapped area of Monaghan to 73 per cent of total land.</P>
      <P>Following representations from farmers, farming organisations and public representatives regarding areas not included, it was decided to carry out a complete recheck of the less severely handicapped areas in Monaghan, including those reclassified in 1995. This recheck highlighted a number of areas which the appeals panel had inadvertently omitted from its original recommendation. A supplementary proposal to the EU Commission was prepared and submitted in April 1997 to include these additional areas.</P>
      <P>Due to pressure of other work, the Commission did not examine this proposal until November 1998, and it was finally approved by the STAR Committee in February 1999, bringing the total more severely handicapped area in Monaghan to 85 per cent of total land.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, based on the data available, all areas of County Monaghan which could be shown to satisfy the criteria for more severely handicapped status have now been reclassified.</P>

      <P>The difficulties experienced by pig farmers in general over the past year or so stemmed largely from EU and worldwide weakness in the sector.</P>
      <P>A number of steps have already been taken to address this. Export refunds were substantially increased. An EU funded private storage scheme, which removed large volumes of pigmeat from the market, was also introduced as was a food aid package for Russia, which included 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat. All these measures have combined to strengthen the EU pigmeat market.</P>
      <P>An indication of this is that Irish pigmeat prices have shown considerable recovery since the start of the year and the market should continue to strengthen. Forecasts are that pig slaughterings will decrease in the final quarter of 1999 and prices paid to pig producers, including those in the Border region, should improve further as supplies begin to tighten.</P>

It further advised that general practitioners intending to prescribe controlled drugs to a drug misuser should ascertain that the patient in question was not already in receipt of controlled drugs through another general practitioner or treatment centre. This is particularly important in relation to the prescribing of benzodiazepines to a patient who is on methadone maintenance, as that person may become destabilised as a result of such treatment.</P>
      <P>The letter gives details on best clinical practice in relation to treatment of opiate misusers in particular and gives details of the persons who can be contacted in health board central services or in my Department if a general practitioner has a problem in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> The majority of general practitioners prescribe in a responsible fashion. I am aware, however, that concern has been expressed about over-prescribing of certain controlled drugs by a small number of general practitioners. Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984 I have the authority to curtail or prohibit the prescribing or supply of controlled drugs by medical practitioners or pharmacists, where the need for such curtailment or prohibition is indicated.</P>
    <P>Following the issue of this letter my Department will be closely monitoring the prescribing of controlled drugs, including benzodiazepines, to ensure that the provisions of the misuse of drugs Acts and regulations made thereunder are observed.</P>

      <P>Heroin addiction is a chronic relapsing condition.</P>
      <P>A variety of treatments, including methadone maintenance, are available to drug misusers.</P>
      <P>However, methadone maintenance is the most evaluated and validated form of treatment in the management of heroin addiction at an international level. Methadone treatment is provided by general practitioners in their surgeries and in addiction centres, satellite clinics or through a mobile clinic. The total number of clients registered on the central treatment list who are currently on methadone is 4,001. This comprises of a total of 2,863 clients for which the Eastern Health Board has provided treatment places at 51 treatment locations. A total of 1,138 clients are being treated by general practitioners.</P>
      <P>The Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations which came into place on l July 1998 allow for tighter control on the prescribing and dispensing of methadone. Since that date additional general practitioners and pharmacists were attracted to participate and to provide treatment for drug misusers locally in their own area. A total number of 42 general practitioners and 190 pharmacists participate in the scheme. All details of patients for whom methadone is being prescribed must now be entered on a central treatment list which is managed and monitored by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>General practitioner co-ordinators are active in recruiting and training general practitioners in the community. The Irish College of General Practitioners provides training for general practitioners and, in addition, the Eastern Health Board has an input into a course in Trinity College for pharmacy training.</P>
      <P>Since the implementation of the methadone protocol, the availability of methadone has been strictly controlled. The protocol has also identified drug misusers who were previously unknown to the services and has strictly limited the number of drug misusers who may receive treatment from any one individual general practitioner. I am satisfied that the introduction of the methadone protocol has significantly improved controls over the availability of methadone and has been effective in extending the number of treatment options available for drug misusers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of providing methadone through general practitioners and pharmacists &ndash; including fees &ndash;  in 1999 to date is £2.016 million. It is difficult to be precise about the cost of providing methadone maintenance through addiction centres and satellite clinics, since the overall cost of running such clinics and centres would include other services such as counselling, HIV testing, urinalysis, etc. I will, however, ask the Eastern <Col N="773" /> Health Board to supply such information as is available to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national task force on suicide in its report, which was published in 1998, put forward a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the national suicide prevention-reduction strategy commenced shortly after publication of the task force report with a partnership approach adopted between statutory and non-statutory services.</P>
      <P>Central to the strategy has been the establishment of a suicide research group by the health boards to conduct research and advise health boards on measures to prevent and reduce suicide and attempted suicide. The group was established in 1998 and has met on several occasions. To date, the group's research-review has covered a range of data, including current Central Statistics Office figures relating to the incidence of suicide; recent research material available on suicide; the new Garda report forms, Form 104, submitted to the Central Statistics Office in cases of suicide and, the work of the newly established suicide committees and co-ordinators-resource persons appointed in each health board area.</P>
      <P>At an early stage in its deliberations, the group recognised the need for research-resource support to assist in carrying out the tasks recommended in the report of the national task force on suicide. Funds have been provided for this purpose and it is hoped that the post of research resource officer will be filled in the near future. It is envisaged that the post holder will be involved in the collation of all existing research material, both national and international and making it available to the committee. The appointee will also examine the effectiveness of intervention programmes and will liaise with local co-ordinators in each of the health boards.</P>
      <P>All health boards have appointed resource officers and have established multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the report. They are engaged in a range of activities, including the promotion of positive mental health and the destigmatisation of suicide, provision of information in relation to suicide and  parasuicide, liaison with the media and provision of training for staff in relation to suicide and parasuicide. The process of consultation with statutory and voluntary groups regarding the issue of suicide has also commenced in many health board areas.</P>
      <P>Priority has been given to the further development of mental health services for groups at risk of suicide, in particular the young and older age sectors of our population. Health boards are examining ways in which mental health services can be made more accessible to such groups and the provision of crisis intervention services is being examined by a number of boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that greater accessibility to relevant health services be available to such groups at times of stress. I am committed to further developing consultant led child and adolescent and old age psychiatry services during 1999 which will assist in the early identification of suicidal <Col N="775" /> behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. Resources totalling approximately £2.5 million have been made available this year to enable improvements to be carried out in these services. It is my intention to further develop these and other mental health services as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that such actions will continue to be developed to assist in the prevention of this tragic problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In previous years the recruitment and selection process for places on both the general and psychiatric nursing registration-diploma programmes was administered by the Nursing Applications Centre. An Bord Altranais has assumed responsibility for the overall management of the Nursing Applications Centre from this year onwards and has renamed it the Nursing Careers Centre in order to give it a broader focus in relation to nursing as a career generally. This transfer of responsibility is in accordance with the strengthened role of An Bord Altranais in the area of pre-registration nursing education and training recommended by the commission on nursing.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparations for this year's competitions, An Bord Altranais, with my approval, amended its own rules to revise the minimum educational requirements for entry to nursing training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the requirements have been brought into line with those of the third level institutions. The effect of this rule change is to expand the range of leaving certificate subjects that may be presented by an applicant for admission to the nursing diploma programmes. In particular, it removes the requirement for a foreign language in the case of the non-NUI third level institutions involved in the operation of the programmes. A decision was subsequently taken by the NUI to drop the requirement for a foreign <Col N="776" /> language for entry to the programmes. These changes introduce greater flexibility in the entry criteria for nursing training, without reducing standards, and will increase the pool of school leavers and others who will be eligible for places on the nursing diploma programmes.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the changes outlined above, together with the national and local recruitment campaigns which I funded, have resulted in a highly successful outcome to this year's competitions for training places on the nursing diploma programmes. A total of 1,217 training places have been filled: 819 in general nursing, 242 in psychiatric nursing and 156 in mental handicap nursing. This is the largest number of direct entrants to nurse training for several years and proves that there continues to be considerable interest among young people and others in nursing as a career.</P>
    <P>As mentioned previously, I provided funding of almost £400,000 for the recruitment campaigns and I regard it as money well spent. I am especially pleased that the promotional campaigns have raised the profile of both psychiatric and mental handicap nursing. This year we succeeded in filling a record 242 training places in psychiatric nursing compared with only 92 places last year, and a record 156 places in mental handicap nursing compared with 117 in 1998. I also made available funding for some 100 extra training places in general and psychiatric nursing this year and these have been offered to applicants who successfully came through the competition.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers who take their own initiatives in this regard. I am aware, however, that the availability of return to working courses for qualified nurses who have been out of the workforce for a number of years is being reviewed with a view to maximising uptake. In addition, improvements have been made to the incremental credit arrangements for both permanent and temporary nurses. These have the effect that nurses can now have all previous genuine nursing experience recognised on appointment whether temporary or permanent.</P>

      <P>Adult cardiac bypass surgery in the public health sector is currently carried out at three centres, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital and since September 1998, St. James's Hospital, Dublin. Paediatric cardiac surgery is carried out at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on a quarterly basis. At the end of June 1999, the most recent period for  which information is available, there was a total of 763 adults awaiting cardiac surgery over 12 months and 259 waiting for three to 12 months. There was a total of 66 children awaiting cardiac surgery over six months, and 18 waiting for three to six months.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in 1998, I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The impact of the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative was to reduce the overall numbers waiting, adults and children at the end of December 1998 by 142. This represents a reduction of over 10 per cent on the figure for December 1997.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health and Children, my priority is to address the existing cardiac surgery waiting lists and the ultimate objective is to achieve an average six month waiting period for those on the lists. I am confident that the development of additional adult public cardiac surgery facilities at St. James's Hospital, Dublin and University College Hospital, Galway will help reduce the waiting lists which exist at present. Target activity levels are in the region of 450 procedures annually at St. James's Hospital and 300 procedures at UCHG. This additional activity will increase existing adult public cardiac surgery capacity by over 50 per cent. I am also developing additional children's cardiac surgery capacity at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin in association with the national cardiac unit, Mater Hospital to provide for up to an additional 100 cardiac procedures for children. This additional activity will increase existing paediatric cardiac surgery capacity by up to 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>The number of adults awaiting cataract operations at the end of June 1999 was 3,156. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the waiting list figures at the end of June 1999 show a reduction of 1,072 on the March figures. This means that waiting lists have fallen by almost 3,000, some 8 per cent since the beginning of this year. The reductions in March and June 1999 are the first since December 1996.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, I have taken an integrated approach to the problem of waiting lists. As the Deputy will be aware, I commissioned a review of the waiting list initiative. I am now implementing a series of measures aimed at tackling the root causes of waiting lists. I allocated £20 million this year to agencies specifically to undertake waiting list work, with £3 million of this funding being allocated to the agencies which achieved the greatest improvements in their waiting lists in the first quarter of the year. This was in line with the recommendations of the review group report.</P>
      <P>I also allocated £9 million to services for older people and £2 million to accident and emergency services, with the aim of freeing acute hospital beds by ensuring the streamlining of emergency services and providing additional step-down and rehabilitation facilities for older people.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the measures I have taken in tackling waiting lists represent the best way of addressing the underlying causes of waiting lists and long waiting times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that costs incurred by businesses arising from their membership of the waste recovery scheme operated by Repak Limited constitute or equate to a tax on the business community.</P>
      <P>Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste requires EU member states to achieve specified recovery and recycling targets for packaging waste. Ireland is required to achieve recovery rates of 25 per cent or more for packaging waste by 30 June 2001 and 50 per cent or more by 31 December 2005.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the principle of producer responsibility, many EU member states, including Ireland, have approached the implementation of this directive on the basis that those businesses which have a major commercial involvement with the placing of packaging on the market, i.e., importers, manufacturers, packer-fillers, distributors and retailers, should have primary responsibility for devising, operating and financing systems for the return and recovery of packaging wastes which subsequently arise.</P>
      <P>Repak Limited was established in 1997 by Irish industry as a voluntary compliance scheme to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste, so as to achieve the national targets specified above.</P>
      <P>Under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, which were introduced to support this initiative and combat the problem of &ldquo;free riders&rdquo;, all producers of packaging waste are required to take certain steps to recover this waste. Particular obligations are imposed on &ldquo;major producers&rdquo; i.e. businesses which annually have a turnover in excess of £1 million and place more than 25 tonnes of packaging waste on the Irish market. Producers have the option either of complying with their producer responsibility obligations under the regulations, or getting exemption from those requirements by becoming a member of Repak Limited's waste recovery scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fees from these member businesses finance Repak Limited's activities. Currently, these fees range from £2,000 to £85,000 per annum, depending on the turnover of the business concerned. Revenue generated has to date been applied mainly to support the collection and recovery of packaging waste from the domestic <Col N="781" /> waste stream but, increasingly, will also be directed to support the recovery of in-house packaging waste generated by member businesses.</P>
    <P>Costs incurred by businesses in meeting their producer responsibility obligations for the recovery of &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; packaging waste are quite distinct from any costs arising from the collection and disposal of wastes generated on their premises. In this regard, it is worth noting that waste collection charges levied by local authorities on commercial interests, and landfill gate fees for privately collected wastes, are generally below the true economic cost of managing the wastes concerned.</P>

      <P>A brief for a major extension of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme to serve Westport, Newport, Mulranny, Murrisk, Lecanvey and Louisburgh, at an estimated cost of almost £21 million, was received in my Department in April 1998. Mayo County Council was subsequently requested to review the proposal in the light of approvals of water supply augmentation schemes for Newport and Mulranny under the serviced land initiative. Following this review, the council now intends to advance the proposal on a phased basis and has submitted a brief for phase 1, involving an extension from Srah to Westport at an estimated cost of £7 million. The brief is under examination in my Department.</P>
      <P>As the proposal is not included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme it comes within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998 which asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next national development plan 2000-06.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Three of the recommendations made by the task force are of particular relevance to my Department. The first of these is that &ldquo;planning authorities, in so far as is possible, shall endeavour to avoid possible overcrowding of accommodation in the planning, designing and location of residential accommodation&rdquo;. The recently published social housing design guidelines set out comprehensive advice for the design of high quality social housing, including guidance on accommodation for different household categories. The recently published planning guidelines on residential density promote increased densities in appropriate locations in the interest of sustainable development. The guidelines emphasise that the overriding concern should be the quality of the proposed residential environment and higher densities should only be permitted where all the criteria which contribute to this environment are satisfied. Planning authorities are advised to consider the preparation of design guides illustrating good examples of residential layouts at increased densities, appropriate to local circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second of the task force's recommendations which falls within my area of responsibility is that &ldquo;planning authorities, in so far as is possible shall endeavour to allocate housing with an objective of having a varied age structure in the local community&rdquo;. The guidelines on residential density specify that all schemes incorporating higher densities, on sites in excess of 1.0 ha, approximately 2.47 acres, should be required to have a variety of dwelling types. A mix of dwelling types in schemes will facilitate a mix of occupants, each of whom has different housing needs. The recently published Planning and Development Bill, 1999, is also relevant. It requires planning authorities to prepare housing strategies to take account of housing needs of the population and future population of the area and to have regard to the need for a mix of house types to reasonably match the requirements of different household categories and to the need to counteract social segregation. All of these measures should lead to more integrated communities. It is also a specific objective of social housing policy to mitigate the extent and effects of social segregation in housing. The expansion of social housing provision that is under way and will be con<Col N="784" /> tinued under the national development plan will continue this policy and concentrate on the provision of smaller, well designed schemes, often on infill sites, that are conducive to the development of integrated communities.</P>
    <P>The third of the recommendations provides that &ldquo;life saving apparatus be available in appropriate places where there is easy access to water&rdquo;. I have asked the National Safety Council, which has responsibility for,<i> inter alia</i>, the promotion of water safety generally, to write to all local authorities and harbour boards drawing attention to this recommendation.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, she has in place to ensure that compensation payments are immediately paid out to farmers who destocked their sheep by 30 per cent in commonage areas; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that this destocking was deemed necessary by her Department for the completion of commonage framework plans for non-REP scheme farmers; if her attention has further been drawn to the fact that promises were made that payment would be made in September 1999; when payment will be released; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>The interim national commonage framework plan, which was introduced in 1998, set a 30 per cent reduction of sheep quotas on commonages in six western counties. This reduction continues to apply for the time being, as the preparation of commonage framework plans to determine appropriate stocking levels for individual commonages is still in progress.</P>
      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has prepared a scheme for compensation payments for income losses to landowners affected by designation of special areas of conservation, SACs, and special protection areas, SPAs, for birds. It is proposed that this scheme will also cover income losses arising from reduction of quotas on commonages. It will be available as an alternative for those farmers who do not opt to join the REP scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food. The compensation scheme is currently being submitted for approval to the European Commission. On receipt of that approval it is intended to make compensation payments to commonage farmers who are not in REPS and who have destocked in line with the interim national commonage framework plan. These payments will provide a fair level of compensation per head of quota removed for income losses this year.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of post-primary education the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. Catchment boundaries are determined on educational rather than transport grounds and the transport regulations, which operate in accordance with these boundaries, are not, therefore, intended to provide pupils with a choice of school.</P>
      <P>I understand that the pupils in question do not attend the second level school in their own post-primary centre and avail of catchment boundary transport to schools in Callan, which is outside of their immediate catchment area. Under the terms of the school transport scheme, a catchment boundary service is the most that may be offered to these pupils.</P>
      <P>It would not be feasible to alter the catchment boundaries in such a way as to facilitate pupils seeking full transport to Callan from other catchment areas. In the circumstances, I have no plans to change the catchment boundaries in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following initiatives are concerned with the implementation of those recommendations of the national task force on suicide referring to my Department's areas of responsibility.</P>
      <P>Guidelines on developing school plans have been issued to all primary schools. Schools are expected to include in their plans measures to promote physical and emotional health and well being. Similar guidelines for second level schools are being prepared.</P>
      <P>The National Educational Psychological and Service Agency commenced provision of its service on 1 September 1999. This service will become available to all schools as it is developed over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Guidance counsellors may be employed by all second level schools, the number of hours sanctioned being related to school size. At primary level my Department is in the process of recruiting a national co-ordinator to assist in the development of the support teacher scheme in primary schools. Support teachers assist in the teaching of those children who manifest behavioural difficulties and, when considered necessary, they ensure that those who require counselling are referred to the appropriate agency.</P>
      <P>The revised primary school curriculum includes a subject entitled social, personal and health education &ndash; SPHE. My Department is currently examining the recommendations of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on a SPHE curriculum for second level schools. The various education programmes on substance misuse and relationships will be subsumed within SPHE. Dealing with personal feelings, including controlling anger towards oneself and others, is a feature of these programmes. Co-operation with the Department of Health and Children is an important part of the process of development.</P>
      <P>My Department co-operates, as well, with the National Youth Council in developing the national youth health programme which includes mental health.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is aware of the gender dimension in suicide statistics. In response, a programme specifically for boys and young men has been developed and will be disseminated later this term. The programme Exploring Masculinities deals with aspects of male life contributing to suicidal feelings. It also deals with the changing roles of men and women, with violence and with sport. Information on support services is also included. The programme was developed, with support from the European Social Fund, for boys in transition year. Its use with boys and young men throughout senior cycle is being explored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> Formal and informal contact has already been established between psychologists in the new national educational psychological service and the suicide response units of certain of the health boards. It is intended that a co-ordinated response to traumatic incidents will be available for all schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time about the number of large classes in the primary system, and have been examining ways to target additional teaching resources to those schools with the greatest need in this area. The new staffing schedule which issued in April last has been structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to a maximum class size of 30 pupils.</P>
      <P>However, the staffing schedule has traditionally been applied on the basis of the previous year's enrolment figures, and this continues to be the case. Therefore the schools which will initially benefit from the new schedule are those which qualify for an additional post in the 1999-2000 school year. Such schools will be in a position to organise classes in such a way as to ensure that there are no longer any very large classes.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at Scoil Barra Naofa on 30 September 1998 of 197 pupils warrants the staffing of a principal and six mainstream class teachers for the current school year. In addition, the school has the service of a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of St. Ultan's national school, Bohermeen, County Meath, referred to by the Deputy are not similar to the situation in Scoil Barra Naofa. I have asked that the situation in Scoil Barra Naofa be further examined and I will inform the Deputy of the outcome in due course.</P>
