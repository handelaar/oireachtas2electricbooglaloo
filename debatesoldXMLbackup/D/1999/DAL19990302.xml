      <Quest>if he will report on his meeting on 23 February 1999 with the Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I met representatives of the Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition. We discussed the situation on and around Garvaghy Road and in the Portadown area generally, the ongoing intimidation and recurring violence in the town and the concerns of the residents. We also discussed recent mediation initiatives and the prospects for making progress. The representatives made clear to me their willingness to approach any such efforts in a positive and constructive way, and I welcome the efforts being made in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the opportunity at my meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on Friday last to relay the concerns of the residents, and we both agreed that a resolution of the impasse would significantly reduce tensions in both communities in Northern Ireland generally and assist in creating <Col N="466" /> a more positive atmosphere where other issues could be more readily resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Good Friday Agreement asserts the right of people in the six counties to live &ldquo;free from sectarian harassment&rdquo; and that the continuing siege of the Garvaghy Road by the Orange Order, with more than 100 illegal parades since last July, and the numerous physical attacks deny this right to that beleaguered community? Will the Taoiseach take this opportunity to call on David Trimble to urge the Orange Order, of which he is a member, to call off the siege now and to meet the representatives of the Garvaghy Road community whose Member of Parliament he is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have done many times, I again call on people to do all they can to resolve the issues of the Garvaghy Road. As the Deputy said, there has been an enormous number of marches which have created many difficulties very weekend since the first weekend in last July. There have been attacks on members of the RUC and on residents of Garvaghy Road. It has created problems for the business people of Portadown and, more than anything else, has created great difficulties for the residents of the Garvaghy Road and the surrounding area in terms of their mobility and ability to go about their everyday life. Unfortunately, there are elements within the Orange Order and outside of it who have continued to create difficulties and it has not been possible to resolve these. Mr. Trimble seems to be relatively powerless to control these people and does not seem to be able to influence them any more than he has to desist from these activities. As the Deputy is aware, some of those politically close to Mr. Trimble were themselves attacked in this area in recent weeks. For my part, I will continue to ask those involved and who have some influence to do all they can to resolve this difficulty in the Garvaghy Road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Taoiseach's response I must again ask, because it is extremely important, if he recognises that there are those on the Unionist side and among British securocrats whose motivation in making decommissioning an obstacle is the destruction of the consensus for the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement so carefully built up across the republican community. Does the Taoiseach recognise the real dangers of allowing such elements to rewrite the Agreement now as we face into the final week before the 10 March deadline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I continually emphasise and say in reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin, all parts of the Good Friday Agreement must be implemented, regardless of who tries to push one section more than another. Decommissioning is not the only part people have a tendency to emphasise, <Col N="467" /> although that section must be implemented. This means that all parties to the Agreement have to accept their responsibilities. Prime Minister Blair and I have emphasised this point at several meetings with the parties in recent days and we will do so again in the next week or so. Attention should be focused on the progress made on the implementation and North-South bodies. In recent days Seamus Mallon said that absolutist policies should not be adopted, that a way should be found around the impasse. Nobody should knock us off course. Attention should be focused on what was agreed which has been explained one hundred times over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach describe the inhibitions on the mobility of the residents of Garvaghy Road as a result of the siege? Are they able to get to work? Are there proposals for a compromise on the substantive issue of the route to be taken by marches? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been many incidents, too numerous to mention, which have caused great difficulty for the residents of Garvaghy Road. The residents coalition issued a long detailed document to me last week. Other parties in the House have also received a copy. I have discussed the matter with Prime Minister Blair and, informally, with the Chief Constable of the RUC, Ronnie Flanagan. An RUC man lost his life in the troubles in the area. The RUC is doing all it can, but the lives of residents have been disrupted in taking children to school, in going shopping and going out at night. There have been nightly disturbances. This instils fear.</P>
      <P>On the second matter, while there have been proximity talks and attempts have been made by intermediaries, there is no common ground. Each time an effort is made the first item on the agenda is the completion of the 1998 parade. This creates a difficulty. One should concentrate on the position in 1999. I have emphasised this point to Prime Minister Blair and political leaders. I have not met the Orange Order, although others have. Progress will not be made as long as the completion of the 1998 parade is the first item on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree this is the most difficult issue facing the North at community level? Having regard to that, on a parallel basis, is he prepared to push the establishment of the civic forum to allow for community conflict of this order to be resolved more speedily?</P>
      <P>Does he see a greater role for Government leaders, or a lesser role for them and a greater role for community leaders? President Clinton has indicated greater involvement in the Northern conflict, the Good Friday Agreement and its implementation. How would he see the next steps in terms of the involvement of Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could deal with the issues <Col N="468" /> creating the impasse, perhaps we could get a spirit of compromise on both sides. It is not any one group's fault. We must achieve an understanding on those issues and that is what we are trying to do. To get the big issue dealt with, we must work through the International Commission on Decommissioning chaired by General John de Chastelain. Numerous sincere efforts are being made to find a resolution. At least I can report to the House that people are trying. If we could find a way around that issue, we could try and tie in some of the other issues. The one raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin, the Garvaghy Road problem, could be tied to these issues and we could get a sense of moving forward from there.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some work has been done on the civic forum but it cannot come before what would be linked to the institutions in the British-Irish Agreement, the North-South bodies and the ministerial council. That would not be acceptable to the sides, although there are positive moves being made.</P>
      <P>There is an enormous amount of work being done on all levels, but until we deal with the fundamental tasks we will not get to those.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next meeting with the Social Affairs Commissioner has not yet been planned. The last time I met the Commissioner was on 23 December 1998, as I have already informed the House. I forwarded a copy of the motion passed by Dáil <Col N="469" /> Éireann on 10 February 1999 to the Commissioner with a covering letter, which I will read to the House together with the reply I received from Commissioner Flynn.</P>
    <P>I have no specific plans to meet Commissioner Flynn in Brussels tomorrow when I understand he is due to return from the USA. If the opportunity arises, I will certainly take advantage of the occasion, as I always do, to meet him and discuss the major issues on the agenda at the moment.</P>
    <P>I will read the two letters to the House, the first of which is from me to the Commissioner:</P>
    <P>11 February 1999</P>
    <P>I wish to bring to your attention the following motion passed by Dáil Éreann last night, Wednesday, 10 February:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>&ndash; noting that it has established a tribunal to inquire into allegations concerning the planning process;</P>
    <P>&ndash; noting the necessity for the tribunal to be allowed to complete its work independently without delay;</P>
    <P>calls on the EU Commissioner for Social Affairs, Pádraig Flynn, to make a full, immediate statement clarifying his position in relation to allegations that he received £50,000 while Minister for the Environment in 1989.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, without prejudice to your legal rights or the independence of your present position, you will wish to give careful and serious consideration to your response to the formally expressed wishes of Dáil Éireann, as the body which is the democratic voice of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It is signed by me. The reply, which I received in fax form on Wednesday last and in hard copy yesterday, is addressed to me and signed by the Commissioner. It states:</P>
    <P>Thank you for conveying to me the text of the Dáil motion of the 10th of February 1999.</P>
    <P>I have voluntarily made a statement to the Flood Tribunal last year, many months prior to the recent controversy. Furthermore, I have to date answered all of the Tribunal's questions on this matter, indicating my willingness to co-operate fully with the Tribunal. If and when required by the Tribunal, I will continue to co-operate and provide my evidence on oath, if that be required.</P>
    <P>At the outset when my co-operation was sought by the Tribunal, it was requested by the Tribunal Representatives that neither I nor my legal advisers would discuss with, or divulge to, any person the matters discussed with the Tribunal. I so agreed and will continue to abide by that undertaking.</P>
    <P>For my part I have to date fully complied with the Tribunal which was after all estab<Col N="470" /> lished by Resolution of the Dáil to investigate issues proper to its remit.</P>
    <P>Recent events have demonstrated the inadequacy of public statements when contrasted with the proper and appropriate disclosure, to the Tribunal established for that very purpose, of all the matters which are properly in its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it would be inappropriate to make a public comment on the matter.</P>
    <P>In the interim, I thank you and other Members of the House for the positive comments made with regard to my performance of my responsibilities as EU Commissioner. I will continue to fulfil my responsibilities with the fullest commitment and to the best of my ability. I do know that you will appreciate and accept that commitment.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>The letter is signed by the Commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the letter the Taoiseach read into the record of the House, is he satisfied with that response bearing in mind the views expressed by all sides of the House during the debate? Is the Taoiseach still of the view that the Commissioner's remaining in his job is pivotal to Ireland's interest? Has he decided yet whether he will reappoint Commissioner Flynn when his term of office expires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have received a response from Commissioner Flynn to my letter conveying the very legitimate concerns expressed by this House a fortnight ago. His reply goes some way towards explaining his position. Indeed it would have been helpful to us all to have had a statement to this effect at an earlier stage, particularly on the day I and the Tánaiste asked him to make a statement.</P>
      <P>In so far as whether I am glad or otherwise, we have to respect the Commissioner's right to have the matter dealt with fully by the Flood tribunal. As regards the Commissioner's professional competency as EU Commissioner, he is doing a fine job &ndash; the House on all sides made that clear in the debate &ndash; and I have no reason to think he will not continue doing a fine job.</P>
      <P>In relation to the appointment of the next Commissioner, the Government has not given any consideration to that matter and it is unlikely to do so until late in the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question I asked was whether the Taoiseach was satisfied with the content of the response in the light of what was said. An allegation has been made about the Commissioner when he was a Member of this House and a member of the Executive. The House has expressed a view. Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the response he has received, yes or no?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not answer yes or no to a <Col N="471" /> question just because the Deputy wants me to. I respect the right of the Commissioner, based on what he has said in this letter to me about the tribunal asking him to keep matters confidential. He stated that the tribunal was set up by this House, that he has been dealing with the tribunal and that the facts, it would seem from this letter, are already with the tribunal. He is indicating his willingness to continue doing anything he is requested to do in the tribunal, including swearing on oath, and I accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think it is satisfactory that somebody should remain in public office with questions of this nature hanging over them without issuing an explanation to the public, who support them in the exercise of their functions in that office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He has already explained to the tribunal set up by the people who represent the public &ndash; ourselves. We set up the tribunal. We asked anyone, through public advertisements, to work in conjunction with that tribunal and the Commissioner is doing that. Rather than someone saying &ldquo;read between the lines&rdquo;, I believe a letter of this nature could have been written some weeks ago. I am asked if I am totally happy. This letter would have helped greatly if it had been sent three weeks ago. It explains the Commissioner's position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What does this letter add to the content of Commissioner Flynn's interview on the way into the lift in the Berlaymont? The Commissioner says nothing new in this letter apart from what he had said to Mr. Tommy Gorman as he was rushing into the lift. After that interview with Mr. Tommy Gorman, the Taoiseach supported a motion in this House asking for a fuller explanation. Have we had a fuller explanation? Is it not true that what is in this letter is substantially the same as was available prior to the Dáil motion calling for an immediate and full statement? Does the Taoiseach accept that this is an adequate response to a resolution of the Dáil which is the source of the tribunal's powers and which resolution was adopted subsequent to the establishment of the tribunal and bearing in mind the existence of the tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there was no other way to proceed I sent the resolution to the Commissioner and asked him to respond. He has responded and the House can make a judgment on his response. I can convey to the House what the Commissioner said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of what is new, I cannot recall exactly what the Commissioner said on the way in or out of a lift and I do not think what he said on that occasion is relevant. His letter makes clear some<Col N="472" /> thing which I did not know previously. The Commissioner says:</P>
    <P>At the outset when my co-operation was sought by the tribunal it was requested by the tribunal representatives that neither I nor my legal advisors would discuss with or divulge to any person the matters discussed with the tribunal. I so agreed and will continue to abide by that undertaking.</P>
    <P>I did not know that until I received a faxed copy of this letter a couple of days ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that subsequent to whatever discussions Commissioner Flynn says he had with the representatives of the tribunal, the Dáil, which set up the tribunal, passed a resolution calling for a public explanation? What weight does the Taoiseach place on that resolution? Does he believe Commissioner Flynn has adequately responded to the resolution passed by the Dáil after the tribunal had been established, in full knowledge of the existence of the tribunal and notwithstanding its existence, asking for an immediate public statement? Does the Taoiseach believe that the call by the Dáil has been adequately responded to by Commissioner Flynn? If not, what will he do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as Commissioner Flynn can answer, it seems to me that he has answered. He has been asked by the House to make a statement and he has done so. He has stated what he has done to date and what he is prepared to do. He is entitled to due process. He is not a Member of this House. Unlike me, he cannot ask or answer questions here. I must accept his reply on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Taoiseach reconcile Commissioner Flynn's unwillingness to answer questions put to him by the Dáil on this matter with his willingness, notwithstanding his undertaking to the tribunal, to discuss exactly these matters on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&ldquo;? How can Commissioner Flynn reconcile the answers given on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; with the prior undertaking he had given to the tribunal, as he now claims, and with his present refusal to answer a question from Dáil Éireann?</P>

I sent a letter to the Commissioner on the day following the debate on the resolution in this House and his reply goes some way towards explaining his position. It would have been helpful if I had his response a number of weeks ago. I must respect the Commissioner's right to have the matter dealt with fully by the Flood tribunal.</P>

      <P>It is clear the Taoiseach understands the position of Commissioner Flynn. The question to which Deputy Bruton and I are seeking a reply relates to the Taoiseach's attitude to a response to a resolution of this House. Does he believe the response he received to a resolution of this House is adequate or will he take the matter further?</P>
      <P>As the allegation is that the money was intended for Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach, as Ceannaire of Fianna Fáil, wrote to Commissioner Flynn, what further action does the Taoiseach propose to take to get answers to that letter or does he propose to simply leave the matter in abeyance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked two questions, the first of which related to whether I am satisfied with the reply I received. The issue is not whether I am satisfied or dissatisfied with it. A fair interpretation of the letter seems to be that this is as far as the Commissioner can go. He is involved in discussions with the Flood tribunal and has given a statement. It seems from this letter he had discussions with it and he indicated his willingness to co-operate fully with the tribunal when called. He said he will continue to co-operate and give evidence under oath if necessary. His advice, and the advice of the tribunal we set up to deal with this matter, is that he should deal with it in this way, by being silent on some matters and co-operating with the tribunal. There<Col N="474" /> fore, I must be satisfied with his response. I was probably more prominent than any other Member in setting up this tribunal. The tribunal requested that neither Commissioner Flynn nor his legal advisers should discuss with, or divulge to, any person the matter discussed with the tribunal and he agreed to adhere to that undertaking. If I were to dispute that, I would be disputing the advise of the sole member of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Flood, and I will not do that. Therefore, I must be satisfied with what Mr. Justice Flood and his team told Commissioner Flynn and his team.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's second question, I am not answerable to this House as Leader of Fianna Fáil. The answer to this question is a matter of public interest and of interest to Fianna Fáil members. The Fianna Fáil Party's view on matters arising from the various tribunals is that we will await the conclusions of the tribunals as to whether any contributions intended for the political benefit of Fianna Fáil were not used for that purpose before deciding on remedial action that might be required in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the way he dealt with the issue of the £50,000 donation? If he were dealing with it again, would he make any changes? Does he consider checks and balances need to be put in place? I appreciate this has been a learning process and I would like to know what has been learned. The Taoiseach said he does not consider the delay of four months in responding to his letter was satisfactory. Can the Taoiseach say how much money would have had to go missing for it to be dealt with in a much more prompt manner? Is there a limit, after which it would be said it would be absolutely unacceptable not to get an immediate reply?</P>

      <P>It is relevant. Could any other voluntary organisation lose £50,000 before the fraud squad and Revenue Commissioners moved in, or is this specific to Fianna Fáil? Does the Taoiseach think other organisations would get away with this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me two questions. In reply to the first, the answer is that I am handling it. The second question was what would excite an organisation about money that might have been there or had gone missing. We did far more than any of the things the Deputy mentioned. The people involved in such a case would set up a fully sworn judicial tribunal, which is what we did. Nothing greater than that could have been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the Commissioner's letter goes some way towards explaining his position. In what way does the Taoiseach consider it falls short? Why does the <Col N="475" /> Taoiseach think the Commissioner can write a letter now setting out his position with the tribunal a year earlier, when he could not reply to the Fianna Fáil letter of 6 October? Has there been any reply to the letter of 6 October?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach established whether Commissioner Flynn got the money in question? Has the Taoiseach made any inquiries into the newspaper reportage over the weekend that the Commissioner said this money was not intended for Fianna Fáil? I remind the Taoiseach that during the debate he said that if any other meetings between himself and Mr. Gilmartin came to light he would advise the House of them. Have any other such meetings come to light?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We have not had a further response to our letter of 6 October, to which the Deputy referred. In terms of our involvement, we have no further evidence of whether this money existed other than what has been written in the media. Any involvement the Fianna Fáil Party had in this was already conveyed to the tribunal through the official in our headquarters in Mount Street; that official gave all the details regarding the matter many months ago.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me in what areas the letter falls short. I am sure I could think up many other questions to which Commissioner Flynn could have responded. However, those issues are now being investigated, or have been investigated, between the tribunal and Commissioner Flynn. He is co-operating with that. Those matters lie with the tribunal. It seems we and everyone else will have to wait for the answers until the tribunal moves on.</P>
      <P>I welcome the intention of the chairman of the tribunal to, as was stated recently, speed up its work and bring it to an early conclusion. In all the circumstances, the Government accepts this may be the best way &ndash; or the only way &ndash; to get to the truth and will require full co-operation to get the comprehensive answers we would all like to hear.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that the advice Commissioner Flynn claims he got from the tribunal lawyers is just procedural caution, that there is absolutely no obstacle in the way of him giving straight answers to the questions that were put to him about this matter and that he is failing in his duty as a public servant in failing to give those answers? Has the Taoiseach shown a copy of this reply to the Dáil resolution to the Tánaiste? Is she as satisfied as he appears to be with this, or does she still regard Commissioner Flynn's position as impossible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Tánaiste has seen the letter and she would be aware of the remarks I have made. I am sure she is looking forward to hearing all the answers as much as I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the legal niceties involved, I would <Col N="476" /> never claim to be as well up on the law as Deputy Bruton. However, I would point out that the tribunal's lawyers, not just Mr. Flynn's, are concerned about this issue. It would seem to me that if this House set up the tribunal, it should have confidence in it. I could not respond to Deputy Rabbitte's question on this matter recently as I was ruled out of order. I would have been quite happy to reply to the effect that this House should have confidence in the tribunal. I have confidence in the tribunal and if the people running it state that witnesses should not discuss or divulge any information relating to personal matters, I will not disagree with that. I do not consider that to be a legal nicety.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach take the advice of the Attorney General in framing the Fianna Fáil amendment to the motion debated in this House on 10 February? Is it not the case that the Government was at that time satisfied with the Fianna Fáil amendment which sought a full and immediate explanation from the Commissioner? How was it reasonable to seek such an explanation then but is unreasonable now? Commissioner Flynn has not given the full and immediate answer requested of him by the Dáil.</P>

I have never tried to formulate the type of reply which Commissioner Flynn should give in this regard. As he had appeared on a television programme, I believed he should be in a position to outline some facts. I said it would be helpful if he were to issue a statement. Someone asked earlier why that statement was not forthcoming; I am sure it is his respect for this House which has resulted in Commissioner Flynn responding at this stage. He was asked, following the passing of a resolution in this House, to make a statement and he has done so. Of course, he had to do so within the legal context of the tribunal and its terms of reference.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind the Taoiseach's comments in this House, his comments about Commissioner Flynn's performance on a television show on which he answered questions in detail and the Commissioner's own comments at the weekend which suggest he actually received a sum of money, it appears that Dáil Éireann, the elected assembly of the people, is the only forum which cannot get detailed answers.

      <P>The number of persons on in-patient waiting lists on 31 December 1998 was 36,883. I am forwarding a detailed breakdown of this figure by hospital and by speciality to the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these figures show an increase over the September position, I again remind the House that there is no simple, immediate or quick fix solution that can be applied to the problem of lengthy waiting lists. The Review Group on the Waiting List Initiative, which I established to advise me on these issues, emphasised in its report that an integrated series of short-term, medium-term and long-term initiatives must be taken to address this issue. Towards this end, I have taken a number of important steps for the financial year. These include allocating £20 million this year for the treatment of patients on waiting lists &ndash; this represents an increase of two thirds over the 1998 figure and is two and a half times higher than the amount allocated by the <Col N="479" /><Col N="480" /> previous Government for waiting lists in 1997 &ndash; providing £9 million to services for older people so that acute hospital beds can be freed up for elective work and providing £2 million to selected accident and emergency services. This will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for those on waiting lists and issuing a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list initiative should be operated in future. The policy circular and guidelines issued by my Department on 7 January 1999 outline revised and updated procedures on improved liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospitals and general practitioners; more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level; improved management of out-patient waiting lists and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list.</P>
    <P>As indicated by the review group, some of these important initiatives will take some time to have an effect, but I am confident they will do so from the early part of this year onwards. While waiting lists have increased, it is important to also consider the length of time patients have to wait for treatment. Waiting times for cardiac surgery and ophthalmology in adults and for orthopaedics and plastic surgery in children have declined since September 1998.</P>
    <P>I am determined to take the necessary medium and long-term steps to tackle the underlying causes of unacceptably long waiting lists and waiting times. This will take considerable effort on the part of many agencies, but I believe we will now begin to show progress in what is a complex problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept from the figures he has given that there was an increase of 1,500 on the waiting lists from the September figure of 35,405 to the end December figure of 36,883? Does he agree that is completely unacceptable and scandalous in the context of the current state of the public finances and that the primary reason for the ongoing escalation in the hospital waiting list is his failure until now to take appropriate action to make the necessary structural changes required to tackle the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> Will the Minister indicate to the House, in the context of the checks he requested health boards to undertake, the number of people currently on the cardiac waiting list and the number who were removed from the waiting list figures as at 31 December 1998 because they had deceased prior to essential surgical procedures being undertaken?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter, I am pleased Deputy Shatter now supports the need for a multifaceted approach to the resolution of this problem and that we have to take the structural <Col N="499" /> changes that I propose in taking on board the recommendations of the review group. That is the first admission I have heard from the Opposition benches that this is required. In relation to the appropriate response, it is clear &ndash; the evidence for 1998 shows this &ndash; that despite the fact that we increased the amount of money by £4 million, or 50 per cent, from £8 million to £12 million, the number on the lists increased by about 3,000. That shows clearly that we cannot solve this problem in the context of the acute hospital sector alone. It is precisely because moneys totalling £9 million are being put into services for the elderly and other areas that we may have the ability to get the throughputs which the increased resources indicate we should have. Perhaps there is now a recognition in the House that moving on all fronts is the only way we will solve this problem and that it is not simply a question of increased resources in the acute hospital sector alone.</P>
      <P>On cardiac surgery, the cardiac lists are being reduced because more cardiac operations are taking place. I do not have the type of statistics the Deputy seeks. It would be inappropriate, wrong and misleading to suggest that the reduction in cardiac surgery waiting lists is as a result of people dying. The reduction is as a result of more surgeries being done. We still have a long way to go in relation to cardiac surgery but, as the Deputy will know, the approval of a £6 million development at St. James's Hospital and provision for phase 1 of the UCG development will greatly increase our capacity in that respect and will take some of the pressure off the national cardiac centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept he or officials of his Department instructed health boards, prior to finalising figures and collating information as at 31 December 1998, to do a comprehensive check of waiting lists to ascertain whether some of the persons on waiting lists in September 1998 no longer required medical treatment and in-patient hospital care either because they had the necessary procedures undertaken through the private as opposed to the public route, which they were entitled to do, or they had died? Will he confirm that health boards carried out that check? Will the Minister indicate the number of people removed from the waiting lists at the end of December 1998 who were on it in September 1988 and who were removed solely because they had deceased or resorted to private medicine because they could not get what they were entitled to through the general medical service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I insisted on a full reply to this question being made today despite having had some inaccurate returns from a few hospitals which turned out to be greater than the waiting list they had suggested. We were not happy that they could have made some of the reductions <Col N="500" /> they suggested had been made. I insisted on coming into the House at Question Time to give this detailed information which was finally collated this morning. The initial reaction would have been to wait for further validation from my Department, but I am satisfied the validation has been done and that these are the accurate figures.</P>
      <P>As regards any suggestion that these waiting list figures were collated differently from other times, that is simply not the case. I answered the Deputy on the basis that we validated these figures as late as this morning and as a result of my insistence that I come into the House today to give them. I was not prepared to come in and say I will have them shortly. The detailed breakdown will be circulated with the reply in the normal way, as is always the case on such matters. The Deputy asked a question which is too specific for me to answer. If he has a particular query, I will answer it. I cannot be expected to come up with the detailed numbers for which he asked me. I have given him the overall figures, the hospital waiting lists and the specialties under which they arise. There is no big mystery about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the number of persons on the waiting list for ENT operations? Will he indicate the number of elderly people awaiting eye operations? Will he comment on a criticism of the health service made in the past few days by a doctor who pointed out that there are elderly people awaiting cataract operations for three to four years and who, at the end of their life span, are sitting at home unable to read and slowly going blind due to the failure of the public health system to meet their needs? What guarantee can the Minister give that all the people in that position will have the necessary procedures provided to them?</P>

      <P>The quote the Deputy made is wrong. The Deputy is, or should be, aware of the format in which these figures are outlined and, as I said, they were finalised this morning at my insistence that I come into the House today to give them. If I were to go through all ENT figures, I would delay the House. They are available in tabular form for the Deputy to add up in due course.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to discuss with maternity hospitals the view expressed by the Master of the National Maternity Hospital in favour of the introduction of a no-fault compensation system to pay for the care of children born with disabilities incurred during birth in view of the recent financial settlement made by the hospital to the parents of a person, details supplied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted the recent comments by the Master of the National Maternity Hospital proposing the introduction of a no-fault compensation scheme to deal with the needs of infants who may be born with disabilities. Several interested groups and individuals have pressed for the introduction of a no-fault scheme for these cases. Apart from removing the need for parents to sue hospitals and doctors to ensure that the care needs of their children are secured, it would save on the high legal and other transaction costs associated with litigation. It would also represent a move to a compensation system based on needs rather than alleged negligence. Under the present adversarial system the parents of children who cannot establish negligence do not receive any compensation.</P>
      <P>My Department has had the advice of a number of experts in this field and has looked at similar schemes in other jurisdictions. As the Deputy will appreciate, the introduction of such a scheme would raise a number of serious legal, constitutional, financial and service issues. In most jurisdictions where such schemes have been introduced parents lose the right to sue for negligence. Furthermore, compensation is restricted to cover care needs, housing, transport and income maintenance. There is generally no compensation for pain and suffering.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to further examine the arguments for the introduction of such a scheme as part of a general overhaul of existing arrangements for medical indemnity cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>Will the Minister be more spec<Col N="502" /> ific about his views on this issue? We are discussing this issue in the aftermath of the Blaise Gallagher case which received much publicity. This case was extremely traumatic for the family and parents of Blaise Gallagher and unnecessarily costly for the State. Many lawyers got fat but the question of fault was not established.</P>
      <P>This case should inform the Minister of the importance of providing an alternative scheme. There are constitutional issues involved in this matter. Regardless of whatever schemes or tribunals have been established, people have always had the constitutional right to go to court. However, in certain instances, particularly those involving cerebral palsy, there is no fault but the person's needs will exist for a lifetime. In light of such instances, would the Minister not accept that it is important that the Department establishes a scheme to ensure that those needs are met and that, as far as is practicable, we avoid the costly exercise of going to court? Would he not accept that, for many parents, it is important that a scheme exists to provide for their children's needs, specifically in cases of cerebral palsy, as already indicated by the Master of the National Maternity Hospital?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that he should sit down with the masters of maternity hospitals to focus on cerebral palsy to see if it is possible to devise a scheme which is fair, appropriate to needs and, in the view of many, would save the State some money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>A fair amount of work has been going on in the Department on this issue in the overall context of medical indemnity cover. What was publicly stated by one of the masters has been said before and it is an issue which we need to resolve.</P>
      <P>Experts have been consulted by the Department, including Mercer Limited, actuaries and insurance consultants. Officials have also met Professor Jeffrey O'Connell, professor of law at the University of Virginia law school. Professor O'Connell has written and lectured extensively on no-fault schemes and has helped draft no-fault statutes for brain-damaged infants in Virginia and Florida. Officials have also met Mr. Randall Boubjerg, principal research associate at the Urban Institute, an independent think tank based in Washington DC. He is joint author of a number of articles on no-fault schemes with Professor Frank Sloan of Duke University. Officials keep in contact with Mr. Boubjerg on developments in this area.</P>
      <P>The Department has also been in touch with people in the Harvard law school, such as Professor Paul Weiler and a colleague who are experts in compensation for medical injuries, including no-fault schemes. We have also been looking at no-fault schemes in New Zealand, Virginia, Florida and Scandinavia. Much work is being done to try to devise a method of dealing with the problem in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> There are arguments in favour and against such a system. Arguments in favour include: removing the need for parents to sue for negligence to secure care for the affected child; saving on the huge legal costs associated with such cases; allowing settlements to be tailored to need; looking after the care needs of children in cases where negligence could not be established, an important feature in the consideration for a no-fault scheme and helping prevent obstetrics from becoming an unpopular speciality because of its association with high cost and high profile claims.</P>
    <P>The difficulties which arise from such a scheme include: it would be difficult to define the precise group of children to whom it might apply; there would be serious boundary problems in including or excluding particular cases; developments in medical research will always threaten the effectiveness of any boundary based on clinical definitions; there would be constant pressure to extend the scheme to infants with similar needs who have not suffered from a birth-related injury, such as those suffering from organic diseases or accident injuries; most no-fault schemes either have a statutory bar on litigation where the infant falls into a clinical category covered by the scheme, or include a provision that parents forfeit their rights under the scheme if they sue. Either prohibition would be difficult to enforce in Irish circumstances; the State might not be able to guarantee the delivery of an appropriate level of care for the lifetime of the children and such a scheme would be expensive and involve compensating children who do not receive awards under the current system.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work remains to be done. I am prepared to examine how, if at all, we can see whether such a scheme can be appropriately incorporated into the general overhaul of medical indemnity cover being undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be more specific in view of the impressive range of expert opinion he has garnered? The current situation is not satisfactory and has more negatives than positives. Is the Minister saying he wants to establish a no-fault compensation scheme and that is his intention? He talked about pros and cons but is his intention to set up the scheme if particular problems can be sorted out? Is that his policy considering the expert opinion he has received?</P>

As part of the process I will have to speak to the Attorney General and seek legal advice as to what constitutional and other limitations are placed on us to try to devise a means by which we can develop the arguments. I am interested in trying to find just solutions to these problems.</P>

      <Quest>if he will discharge the fees payable by student nurses undertaking a fourth year nursing undergraduate degree course and render them eligible for maintenance grants in view of the nursing shortages in hospitals and the proposal of the Commission on Nursing that a nationwide nursing degree programme be put in place to commence in 2002, to be funded in the same way as other undergraduate degree programmes in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the one year full-time degree course which the National University of Ireland, Galway, is offering to students who have successfully completed the nursing registration-diploma programmes, the first of which was introduced in 1994.</P>
      <P>Successful completion by a student of the three-year nursing registration-diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment as a nurse. Since a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, such a qualification would be an optional post-registration qualification. Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a nursing degree programme, therefore, are responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees. I am not in a position to provide funding for these courses.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the whole area of pre-registration nursing education and training was examined in depth by the Commission on Nursing. The commission recommended that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses should be based on a four-year degree programme in each of the disciplines of general, psychiatric and mental handicap nursing, approved by An Bord Altranais, which will encompass clinical placements, including 12 months continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service. The commission envisaged that the start of the academic year in 2002 would be specified as the commencement date of the proposed new degree programme.</P>
      <P>As a first step, the commission recommended that a representative nursing education forum be established to prepare a strategy for moving pre-registration nursing education and training to a four-year degree programme in time for the intake of nursing students in 2002. I have established this forum which is chaired by Dr. Laraine Joyce, deputy director of the Office for Health Management. It includes representatives of the schools of nursing, health service providers, third level institutions and An Bord Altranais. A majority of the members of the forum are members of the nursing profession. The forum held its first meeting on 10 February and is proceeding with its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> The provision of funding for an undergraduate degree course in nursing, similar to that being provided at the National University of Ireland, Galway, would not improve the current situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the shortage of nurses. In fact, it would have the opposite effect. As I stated earlier, successful completion by a student of the three-year nursing diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment as a nurse. A further year of studies would reduce the number of nurses available for employment and only serve to exacerbate the current problems the agencies have in relation to the recruitment of nurses.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing considered this difficulty when making its decision regarding the introduction of the four-year degree programme for nurses. It was for this reason it proposed that the third year of the degree course would be a 12 months continuous clinical placement as a paid employee of the health service. It should also be noted that the commission emphasised that the proposed new degree programme should not commence before the start of the academic year in 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the proposed new degree programme will be an undergraduate programme and that the participating students will have their fees discharged by the State in the same manner as the fees of other third level undergraduate students are discharged at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, financial supports were available for students undertaking diploma programmes. They received an annual maintenance grant and other financial supports. The value of the grant was £2,500 when first introduced in 1994. It remained at that level until 1998 when it was increased by 20 per cent to its current level of £3,000. I announced on 20 January a further increase, giving a total of £3,250 with effect from 1 April next. This maintenance grant is not subject to a means test and will have been increased by 30 per cent in the lifetime of the Government.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf. The average annual fee is approximately £1,350. There is also a book allowance and other allowances which bring the average annual total value of these supports to approximately £6,000 per nursing student. This compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume I am correct in assuming that from 2002 the fees of students attending the undergraduate degree course will be met by the State. It is an even greater anomaly that the same privilege is not extended to the nurses who have completed the diploma course and who are now doing the one year undergraduate course. The additional year will result in their having an extra qualification which ultimately will be to the benefit of the health service.</P>

      <P>The nursing education forum is meeting to decide the basis on which we will move to the degree programme from 2002. It may involve the abolition of fees or a continuation of the payment to health agencies. This will be decided by the forum.</P>
      <P>I have received representations regarding the particular problem which has arisen in Galway involving the students there. The NUI, Galway, effectively extended the original three-year diploma programme to a four-year degree course in 1998. It did so before the independent external evaluation of the first diploma programme, introduced in Galway on a pilot basis in 1994, was completed. The commission made it clear in its report that no third level institute or discipline should commence the programme prior to the agreed date. In making this point, the commission was concerned that for a third level institute or discipline to do otherwise would result in a recurrence of many of the difficulties encountered in the transition to the registration-diploma programme.</P>
      <P>This is why I have been unable to assist the students on the course the NUI, Galway, introduced before the evaluation was completed. I provided extra money totalling £7.5 million this year for nursing education, bringing the total to approximately £32 million. However, I cannot accommodate these students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing in the education area from 2002, it is particularly anomalous that these students, who are effectively doing a four-year nursing course, must meet their fees for the final undergraduate year in Galway. In three or four years, nurses undertaking the four-year course will not have that difficulty. Will the Minister reconsider his approach to the fee issue in the context of the lead in years to the four-year undergraduate nursing degree which will come on stream in 2002? It is to the benefit of the health service that a number of nurses are participating in this fourth undergraduate year and obtaining a degree. They will ultimately use the additional knowledge to the benefit of patients under their care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's point. However, the anomaly was not created by the Department or An Bord Altranais. In 1997 NUI, Galway, indicated to the Department that it <Col N="507" /> intended to introduce a one-year full-time degree course for nursing students who had successfully completed the three-year diploma programme. They are not required to undergo this extra year to qualify as nurses. They took on this optional extra year. Up to now nurses had to fund their own postgraduate education and we are trying to address this. On the basis that NUI, Galway, introduced the course&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the proposal was made in 1997, the Department made it clear to the college authorities that it would not be in a position to provide funding for such a course and that the approach favoured by it was the provision of part-time degree courses which would be open to graduates from the diploma programme as well as existing registered nurses. Dublin City University and Trinity College, Dublin, had already developed part-time nursing degree courses along these lines. However, NUI, Galway, proceeded to introduce the full-time degree course in January 1998 and it is offering it again this year. No other third level institution has followed NUI, Galway, in offering a full-time degree course. These types of difficulties were addressed in the commission's report. It is necessary to plan for the new graduate course from 2002 and to ensure there is no repeat of some of these anomalies, which arose because not everybody used the same starting date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequent to the announcement in the 1999 budget, which was in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government to review medical card eligibility for the elderly, the chief executive officers of the health boards have decided to implement, from 1 March, changes in the income limits for people over 70 consistent with the budget statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> At present, 80 per cent of persons aged 70 and over, that is, about 231,000 individuals, have medical cards and it is estimated that figure will rise by 30,000, to 90 per cent, at the end of the three year doubling of the existing income limits referred to in the budget.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have taken place with the Irish Medical Organisation on this matter. In all, four meetings were held and all outstanding issues in relation to its implementation have been resolved. The principal aspects of the agreement reached with the IMO last Thursday relate to a recalibration of the general medical scheme capitation rate for the over 70s age band, the facility for persons who become eligible for a medical card to opt to remain with their existing private GP and a realignment of the indicative drugs target scheme to take account of the increased drugs costs associated with elderly persons. The issue of negotiations with the National Association of Independent General Practitioners on this or other matters does not arise since they do not hold a negotiating licence. In any event many of the NAIGP members are also members of the IMO.</P>
    <P>On the issue of care for the elderly generally, the policy is, to the greatest extent possible, to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home with the support of community care services where necessary and where this is no longer possible, to ensure they have access to the best possible medical or long-term care. This has been the policy adopted by successive Governments since the publication, in 1988, of a report on the development of services for older people, entitled The Years Ahead. Medical care is delivered to a wide range of dependent older people by consultant geriatricians and their teams together with medical officers of community hospitals. This will remain in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This point needs to be clarified. The press coverage of the resolution the Minister has come to with the Irish Medical Organisation did not include doctors outside the general medical scheme. It is my understanding that such doctors will not be able to continue to treat an elderly person if that person wants to avail of this new scheme, which is welcome and I compliment the Minister on introducing it. The only indication of any special arrangements were for retired GMOs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important point. The question is whether a doctor who is outside the general medical scheme &ndash; and most of these are younger doctors who have not been able to get into the scheme &ndash; and who is treating an elderly person who is for the first time qualifying under this scheme, can continue to treat that patient. My understanding from reading the press coverage is that that is not the case. I am delighted to hear that it may be, but the Minister should clarify whether that continuity of care will be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not have to tell Deputy McManus that she should not believe everything she reads in the press. The agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on this issue responds to the situation of those doctors who are not general medical scheme contract holders who could lose some of their elderly private patients who benefit from the increased medical card income limits. One effect of the agreement will be to ensure that a person over 70 gaining a medical card will be able to stay on with his doctor provided the doctor has the relevant experience, which is likely to be the case. It is worth emphasising that the whole matter of general practitioner entry to the general medical scheme was already being examined in a broad sense by a working group set up last year. The terms of the agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on entry to the scheme are in line with discussions in the working group, and the full details of the operational aspects of the agreement's provisions on entry will be teased out in the next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying doctors who <Col N="510" /> have been operating only in private practice are essentially part of the general medical scheme in the context of their retaining current patients over 70 years of age? Does that mean other patients who attain the age of 70 in the future can remain with their doctors, or that other patients who are currently with doctors who are part of the general medical scheme can transfer to doctors who are not when they attain the age of 70? </P>
      <P>I also welcome this scheme, but I ask the Minister to clarify the reason the age of 70 was chosen and whether it is the Minister's intention to reduce that incrementally? In other words, might we see elderly persons over 65 or 66 being brought into this scheme next year? What are the Minister's proposals in this context? Does he envisage ultimately abolishing the means test in the context of the medical card?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The commitment in the budget statement is to double the income eligibility limits for all people over 70 within the next three years. There will be a 33.3 per cent increase each year to eventually achieve a doubling of the eligibility limit. There is no proposal to abolish income eligibility limits. That would involve changing the Health Act. I do not believe that is necessary in any event. We simply want to ensure that old age pensioners, particularly those who have small State pensions or other small pensions along with that, who up to now have been rendered ineligible for a medical card will now be eligible in the vast majority of such cases.</P>

      <P>I would not accept the suggestion that the psychiatric committal system operated under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, has collapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, as amended by subsequent Acts, lays down detention procedures for persons with mental disorder under three categories; either as a temporary patient, a person of unsound mind or an addict. Briefly the <Col N="511" /> procedures governing the involuntary admission of a patient to a psychiatric hospital or unit are as follows. In the first instance an application for a person to be admitted as an involuntary patient is completed, normally by a spouse or relative of the patient. The application must be made to the person in charge of the hospital and be accompanied by a recommendation from a registered medical practitioner following examination that, in his or her opinion, the person meets the criteria for involuntary admission. In the case of a private patient, two medical practitioners must certify, following separate examinations, that the person meets the criteria for involuntary admission. The decision to make an involuntary admission order on the basis of the application and accompanying certificate from one or two medical practitioners is a clinical decision taken by a medical officer in the psychiatric hospital or unit. I am satisfied these procedures are operating satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Garda Síochána under the Mental Treatment Act are limited to assisting in the conveyance of a patient who is the subject of an application for detention as a person of unsound mind in accordance with section 169 of the Act. Section 184 relates to making an application for a temporary involuntary admission order and, in such cases, the Garda is not empowered to provide assistance in the conveyance of the person to hospital. In normal circumstances the applicant would accompany the person to hospital. Where the applicant is unable to convey the person to hospital, nursing staff of the hospital where the person is to be conveyed usually provide assistance. I am aware, however, that some nursing staff in one health board are refusing to assist in the conveyance of patients to hospital. In such cases, other health professional staff assist in the conveyance of patients as the need arises.</P>
    <P>New mental health legislation, currently being prepared in the office of the Attorney General, will empower the Garda Síochána, where necessary, to assist health professionals in ensuring that persons who need to be detained are conveyed to hospital with the minimum delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of an incident in which a general practitioner who adjudged that a patient should be an involuntary admission found it impossible to have the patient conveyed to a hospital despite all the necessary forms being completed? An ambulance arrived without nursing staff and when the gardaí were called, the garda was unwilling to sit in the ambulance to assist the ambulance driver in conveying the patient to the hospital. Does the Minister consider it appropriate that public health patients deemed to require involuntary admission should be left in the community due to the absence of the necessary conveying arrangements to facilitate their admission to hospital?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers and which was recently published in a journal. It is not an appropriate situation. In one health board area, there is a problem because some nurses, although not all, have been refusing to do this work, probably as a result of an incident some years ago in which three psychiatric nurses were seriously injured in attempting to remove a patient to hospital. Senior nurses have been attempting to cover such cases, as in the instance mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that the matter will be satisfactorily resolved until new mental health legislation is enacted. That is being given priority in my Department. The new legislation currently being prepared will provide for only one category of admission. Currently, such admissions are covered by sections 169 and 184. Until the new legislation is enacted to empower the Garda Síochána to assist where necessary to ensure that patients who need to be detained are conveyed to hospital with the minimum delay, the situation described by the Deputy could, unfortunately, recur.</P>
      <P>I agree it is unsatisfactory and that we must deal with it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>In which health board area are there such difficulties at present?

Will the Minister also indicate when the new Bill will be published?</P>

It is a matter we will have to work on but it will not be resolved until the new mental health legislation is introduced. I hope to publish it shortly. I cannot give a date at present. As a result of this problem I have tried to bring forward that aspect of mental health legislation, to give it the priority treatment it deserves rather than hold up everything. That is what I intend to do.</P>

      <P>I recollect this legislation being raised on the Order of Business. Originally, the House was informed that the legislation would be ready in February; then it was told it would be March. Is the Minister aware of the concerns expressed by a number of organisations, including the Schizophrenia Association of Ireland, at the delay in publishing this legislation? If he intends to separate various aspects of the legislation and to deal solely with this issue, can he guarantee that it will be dealt with during this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be able to give such a guarantee. Unfortunately, I am informed by the Office of the Attorney General that the volume of legislation on North-South issues is having an effect on my legislation coming forward as quickly as I would like. I have the assurance of the Attorney General that the person who is dealing with this legislation will do so as quickly as possible in that context. I have to accept the Attorney General's position. He is aware of my anxiety to bring this legislation forward as quickly as possible. I would like to see it published in this session but I cannot give that guarantee without discussing it with him again. I discussed it with him about three weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the psychiatric committal system has effectively collapsed within the Eastern Health Board area due to the difficulties which are so well portrayed in the case to which we referred earlier? Will he acknowledge that it is an urgent necessity that legislation is brought before the House to address this issue? In the intervening period will the Minister consult with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to ensure greater Garda assistance and co-operation when it is required in such difficult cases? Finally, would the Minister acknowledge, given the information he has outlined, that there is little possibility of this legislation being enacted before the end of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the last point. There is every possibility that the legislation can be enacted before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>I do not accept there is a collapse. In this particular case difficulties arose and I outlined the reasons. I do not suggest it is a satisfactory situation. However, the fact that we can agree on the unsatisfactory nature of one case does not mean the entire system has collapsed. That is clearly not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda in this case were not empowered because it was a section 184 application. The objective of the amending legislation is to remove that distinction so that regardless of whether the committal is under section 169 or 184, the Garda would have the power to assist. <Col N="514" /> Most people would agree that the Garda should be able to so assist.</P>

      <P>I propose to takes Questions Nos. 49, 59, 79, 81, 89, 259, 266 and 267 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on the waiting list initiative recommended that my Department should consider introducing positive financial incentives to hospitals to reduce waiting times. In line with this recommendation, I have decided to retain some of the funding available for waiting list initiative work and to redistribute it to those hospitals which show the most progress in reducing their average waiting times.</P>
      <P>My Department has notified agencies that they will risk a reduction in their current waiting list funding during 1999 if it becomes clear that they are falling substantially below the targets agreed under their service plan.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy for the period ending 31 December 1998, the latest date for which complete data are available, is being circulated with this reply.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the difficult situation of patients who are awaiting different surgical procedures. I have recently taken a range of significant initiatives to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times for public in-patients, details of which I gave the House in an earlier reply.</P>
      <P>Public in-patient waiting lists are maintained by every acute hospital in the country. In its recent policy circular on the operation of the waiting list initiative, my Department emphasised to agencies the importance of validating these lists so that an accurate and up-to-date picture of the situation can be available at all times.</P>
      <P>Information regarding persons who have been removed from the waiting list or who are waiting to be placed on the waiting list for treatment is not routinely collected by my Department. The number of persons awaiting cataract removals at the end of December 1998 was 3,110, while the number awaiting hip replacements was 1,590.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what remedy he proposes to address the anxiety, concern and the pain and suffering caused to patients on waiting lists, given their families are concerned particularly where there is a threat to their health? What is the Minister's answer to this? Most of the information he has given, while helpful, is statistical. How will he address the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The review group recommendations must be implemented to deal with this matter a little differently than in the past. It is not simply a question of extra resources. If that was the case, one would have expected the lists to have been reduced. That is why we are moving on all fronts. We are targeting specialties and I am giving waiting list money to those with the most significant waiting lists and times; cardiac surgery and cardiology, ENT, gynaecology, opthamology, orthopaedics, plastic surgery, general surgery, urology and vascular surgery. Funding will be provided under the waiting lists initiative only in respect of these specialties.</P>
      <P>Baseline activity is also included in the service plan out of the allocations the hospitals have received for the year. What we are seeking to achieve is outlined in the circular I formulated where it is stated clearly that I want to achieve a significant reduction in the number of public patients awaiting elective procedures and a significant increase in the number of elective procedures being carried out. I have set out the target specialties on which I want a particular emphasis. I will also publish and circulate the waiting lists and times in all hospitals, to try to break some of the GP referral patterns, which do not appear to make much sense; those who already have high numbers on their lists are having more patients referred to them while those with lower numbers are not having any referred to them. I can gauge why that is the case, but I will not say it; although I have told them privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That information is necessary because the patient is the person suffering from the deficit in information. If a patient knew he was being referred for a hip replacement to a specialist with a waiting time of 15 months while another consultant has a waiting time of 6 months, he is entitled to ask his GP why he is not being <Col N="518" /> referred to the second consultant. In many instances, that information is not given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>They will know as a result of the information we will circulate. That may change referral patterns, which is an important aspect of these proposals. There are two actions involved; I am holding back money for those who do the work and I am threatening those who do not do it that I will take it from them. We may see some progress then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that for a patient to have the maximum available to him or her, there is a need for new on-line services where up to date information is collated, centrally through his Department, and which is then made available to the public and general practitioners? The manner in which information is currently collated is grossly inadequate in the context of communicating to patients the availability of consultants. What steps is the Minister taking to make this type of information more readily accessible to patients and general practitioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for hospitals, working with their consultants and implementation teams, set up as a result of this circular, to communicate the information quickly. Some hospitals are still doing this manually which is not acceptable. I have stated in a circular that the IT system should be capable of providing me with all the information requested under these guidelines, which require more information from hospitals than previously. In addition to the information currently being provided, I am also asking that the following information be given; the number of baseline activity elective procedures being carried out in addition to what is being done on the waiting list; the number of elective procedures being carried out under the waiting list initiative; the number of persons being added to the waiting list since the end of the previous quarter and the overall net reduction or increase in the numbers waiting since the end of the previous quarter in respect of each of the following; the waiting list for each target specialty provided at the hospital; the average or median waiting time in respect of each specialty; the waiting list of each consultant within each target specialty and the average or median waiting time of each consultant.</P>
      <P>I propose to circulate that information as it would be beneficial to make the information on elective procedures, waiting lists and times more transparent for the purposes of GP referrals and as a reference point within and between hospitals. In this context, it is envisaged that further funding will be made available during 1999 under the waiting lists initiative to reward those hospitals which are performing best and achieving, and, or exceeding the targets in their service plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea is to get more information quickly. There was an indication that I would come into <Col N="519" /> the House without the figures sought by Deputies, which I insisted on getting, and after a push, I got. I am not happy nine weeks later. The circular states six weeks, which gives people plenty of time to compile the information I want. If hospitals are having difficulty giving me that information within six weeks, they need not bother looking for waiting list money at all.</P>

      <P>If I did not have to keep repeating myself for 30 minutes during Question Time earlier I would have reached the questions relating to Agenda 2000. It was a pity that I did not get to them because I would like to have dealt with them before my meetings with the European Commission tomorrow. It would have helped me, but other matters were important and it is for the Opposition to decide whether to question me. I repeated myself non-stop.</P>
      <P>There are pressures on us to try to negotiate on the proposals. Last week the Minister for Agriculture and Food was very successful in moving them on to the stage that he did and we will continue to do so. The situation with milk quotas is difficult as the 1984 agreement has probably not been treated seriously. I do not know who was the Minister in 1984 but that agreement has not been treated very seriously by the Commission. We thought that it was a very watertight agreement, but we will continue to deal with that as best we can.</P>
      <P>We will continue to negotiate on the other issues relating to Structural and Cohesion Funds but I am hopeful that, as in 1989 and 1992, we will get a satisfactory settlement. However, we must take non-agricultural areas into account. Deputy Connaughton referred only to agriculture but we will continue to negotiate to get the best deal we can. I appreciate that he is being constructive.</P>

When will the Government introduce the necessary legislation implicit in Ireland's signing of that convention? Is Israel a party to the convention?

The information which can be gathered at roadblocks can already be ascertained through visiting sites, factories, etc. We are all aware of the public outcry when news of the prospect of roadblocks manned by gardaí, social welfare inspectors and Revenue staff was first reported. The phrase &ldquo;police state&rdquo; was frequently and indignantly used.</P>
      <P>The critical views I have heard expressed come from many sources. I have heard from the unemployed, and I was contacted by those fortunate enough to be at work. They all expressed a common and deep resentment at this proposal. They see it as another measure designed to harass people from all walks of life, especially the unemployed. I know the Minister does not intend to offend law-abiding, compliant taxpayers. It is important to note that many of the people who do not currently work are anxious to return to the workforce. They do not carry a burden of guilt because they are unable to find employment. In the opinion of those who contacted me, this measure is a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I was also contacted by a few members of the Garda Síochána who are opposed to the concept. They said these measures would send out the wrong message at a time when they had succeeded in building up public confidence in, and support for, the force through its outstanding work. The Minister, who has made a number of public statements, should revisit the issue I have been asked to raise by my constituents. Staff of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs should be removed from roadblocks in experimental areas. There should be a reversion to the resources available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill is often ignored by the media and economic commentators. It is perceived as an administrative Bill providing for increases in social welfare payments. It is, however, about much more than giv<Col N="529" /> ing the green light for increases. In previous Social Welfare Bills power was given to make regulations governing such matters such as entitlement to payment. I hope the Minister noted carefully the comments of his colleague, Deputy O'Flynn, about section 26 which extends the powers of social welfare inspectors to stop vehicles and question passengers. This is ill-conceived. Social welfare inspectors have adequate powers under section 212 to which the Minister referred.</P>
      <P>At Dublin Castle the Moriarty and Flood tribunals are investigating the ripping off of the State on a colossal scale. There is clear evidence of a golden circle. In the last Dáil I indicated year after year at the Committee of Public Accounts that social welfare fraud, which we are in favour of rooting out, accounted for 0.5 per cent of the social welfare budget. The Revenue Commissioners estimate outstanding tax liabilities at between £2 billion and £5 billion. There is no will to tackle tax fraud.</P>
      <P>Less than one year ago I asked the national bureau of fraud investigation to investigate allegations that the State had been ripped off to the tune of £200 million by way of offshore accounts. Its response was that it had not received a complaint, I presume from the Minister of Finance or the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>On 3 December the Minister said the 1999 budget was about building an inclusive society. Last week he said an extra £317 million was being made available for 1.3 million members of society and that the Bill signalled a radical shift in the way we look at social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has increased since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has some good features. While the Minister has listened to groups such as the Carers Association, he has not provided firm foundations for an inclusive society. For those living on the margins the budget did not deliver. When the provisions of the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill are implemented the gap between the haves and the have nots will increase. According to the ESRI, there are now more people living below the poverty line than ten years ago. Given the predicted growth rate of about 6 per cent until 2005-06 the gap will continue to widen.</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget presented an unprecedented and unparalleled opportunity to make an impact on poverty. As I indicated in the debate on the Finance Bill, the Minister had an extra £1 billion to spend. While it is the Government's tactic to refer to what was implemented by the previous Administration, our economic circumstances are much different. The economy is growing much faster than anyone predicted.</P>
      <P>In the days following the announcement of the 1999 budget, Government spokespersons attempted to overstate the fact that all social welfare payments are now above the recommended minimum level. This could not have been avoided in the context of the commitments given in Partnership 2000. Given our outstanding economic performance, fulfilling the commitments given in Partnership 2000 was the least welfare recipients could have expected.</P>
      <P>An increase of £3 is provided for in the Bill. This means social welfare recipients will be worse off in real terms. Prior to the budget the ESRI pointed out that there was a real need to link welfare increases with real wage increases. Otherwise they predicted a widening of the gap between rich and poor. In terms of the adult dependant rate, for example, the increase was even more disappointing. As I pointed out to the Minister at Question Time recently, the adult dependant rate has fallen behind the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare 11 years ago. That day the Minister discussed at length with me the issue of equalisation, but I still return to the basic point I made two weeks ago: who in society can live on £43.20 per week, the adult dependant rate over which the Minister will preside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am genuinely disappointed that the Social Welfare Bill contains no provisions to address the inequalities in the social welfare code and end long-term discrimination against women, who form the bulk of adult dependants. During my <Col N="531" /> time as Labour Party spokesperson for social, community and family affairs the issue of equality for women in the social welfare code will be one of the key issues which this House must address. I know I will have the support of all the social partners in campaigning on this particular issue.</P>
    <P>The £6 increase in the old age pension has been put forward as one of the main selling points of the budget, but people should not be deceived. That increase will only apply to the main pensioner. The adult dependant, usually the woman, will only receive half of that.</P>
    <P>The budget did nothing to address the issue of means testing for social welfare payments. We have long been aware of the fear faced by many older people about the impact of small nest eggs on their social welfare payments. The Minister has made some gesture towards retired small business people who often barely meet the means test levels and end up losing out on basic provisions. Previous Governments introduced savings disregards for people in this situation, but this year the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, ignored it.</P>
    <P>The importance of child benefit in eliminating child poverty can never be overstated. Over the past year the Commission on the Family, the Combat Poverty Agency and a host of lobby groups have made a credible case for increasing the rate of child benefit. Child benefit of course does not create poverty traps and this is important in creating a welfare-to-work friendly society. In certain cases child benefit is the only payment which goes directly to the mother in a household. The payment, according to the Commission on the Family, allows people to make choices. They can put the money towards child care or use it to supplement the household budget.</P>
    <P>In the context of the debates which took place in the run up to the budget on both child care and child poverty, the increase in child benefit was disappointing. The Minister will be aware that six years ago at the start of the partnership Government my party had a target of £20 per week for the first two children. I notice that another party in this House has come around to our point of view. I am not sure if this Government understands the rationale behind the policy of freezing the child dependant allowance over recent years while increasing the rate of child benefit. Unless it begins to show an understanding of this policy, it should simply revert to increasing the child dependant allowance.</P>
    <P>In terms of some of the other payments addressed in this Bill, I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage to eliminate anomalies and to ensure clarity and greater consistency in the system. For instance, the Bill allows for regulations to be drawn up to extend the carer's allowance to people who may not be living in the home of the person being cared for. The Minister deserves commendation for providing for that in the Bill, given the fact that 45 per cent of carers <Col N="532" /> are in this situation. I welcome this important provision, which should be written into the Bill rather than implemented by way of regulation. This would allow all Members of the Dáil to table amendments, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied about the timing of the payments in sections 4 to 7, inclusive, in which he outlines this year's basic increases in social assistance and social insurance payments? The social insurance increases come into effect on 6 April, 27 May, 31 May, 3 June and 4 June. There are similar dates for the social assistance increases. Famously, child benefit increases come into effect on 1 September. In answer to a written parliamentary question a couple of weeks ago, the Minister estimated the cost of paying these social welfare increases, except child benefit, on 6 April, that is, the cost of having the tax and social welfare years operating from 6 April, as being in the region of £350 million. We could make a huge case, in equity, for doing so. If the Minister wants an inclusive society, surely it means that the income of all of the population should be regulated at similar times and in a similar fashion.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in his contribution on the Finance Bill, stated that his target is to bring all the tax regulations and Finance Acts into force according to the calendar year so that we will operate in budgetary terms from 1 January to 31 December. That being the case, there is an overwhelming case, from the point of view of inclusion, to allow all citizens acquire their social insurance or social assistance increases at the same time. There is little the Minister can do about it this year. In future years, if the Government survives, he could look seriously at ways of bringing forward the date of these increases. The partnership and rainbow Governments put in place a programme to move the date of payment of those increases towards April and for some reason this Government stopped it. I would ask the Minister to look at that and, indeed, the September date of payment of child benefit. Many of us are canvassing for the forthcoming local elections and this is one of the complaints which one hears constantly when one talks about budgetary provisions.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the problem of income adequacy. It is a huge area which the Minister tried to address to some extent in his Department's strategic document. He stated that adequate rates of payments should be a central objective of income support, but when one sees the unemployment assistance increase for a person with two children from £136 to £141.60, a widow from £70.50 to £73, and the payment to a lone parent with two children which has increased to £103.90 &ndash; the social insurance rates are little better &ndash; one must ask the stage which we have reached in providing adequate incomes for a third of the population who depend on these payments.</P>
    <P>When the Government was elected it made some gestures towards Fr. Seán Healy and others who were interested in presenting in programme for a basic income and we heard that there were <Col N="533" /> interdepartmental working groups, etc. This House would like to know the Minister's thoughts on this issue. It seems to me and the Labour Party that a civilised society must be one in which all citizens have a basic income.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to have been allowed to speak first, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I think it arose because my dear colleague, Dr. Pat Upton, died last week. He was a great family man and a member of the Labour Party. He was a great social democrat and representative of Dublin city. One of his chief attributes was a raging determination to alleviate the great difficulties of many of his constituents, particularly in the south inner city, who were on inadequate incomes. This is an area in which he was deeply and profoundly interested. He did not get an opportunity to represent the Labour Party on these matters in this House, but it was something which moved him greatly. It is appropriate that I mention him as I make my way through the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The measures in child benefit are disappointing. When the expert group on child care reported recently under Partnership 2000, the Minister and his colleagues sent the report, as he has done with so many issues concerning his Department, to another interdepartmental group to consider the tax and other issues involved. I know the central issue is to be fair to parents doing home duties as well as to working parents, but the Government does not appear to have any clear idea of the areas in which it will make progress.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the representations the Minister received from the National Association of Widows in Ireland. Neither the Bill nor the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, seem to address the fundamental issues, particularly those affecting working widows and widows attempting to return to work. The Government's ambition is to reduce the poverty index from 9 per cent to 15 per cent of our population to between 5 per cent and 10 per cent by the year 2007, but with the enormous rises in social welfare we will have to do much better in terms of our approach to this legislation and to provision for the poorer sections of our society.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 7 and the family income supplement, I will attempt to amend some of the provisions in the section, for example, the difficulty of workers who no longer work 38 hours per fortnight. My party made a series of proposals recently on the back to work allowance and the area based allowance which we would like the Minister to consider. Those proposals have merit given that the scheme for the self-employed has had considerable success. The Labour Party in particular is interested in merging the two schemes and the extension of some income support measures such as FIS to new entrepreneurs coming off long-term unemployment benefit. We are also concerned that the unemployment duration period for the back to work scheme remains at one year. We see no reason it should not be reduced to six months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> The Minister's Department and his colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should be encouraged to extend the back-up facilities in terms of advice, financial support and the whole facilitation network in the local employment service and in the partnership areas. The success achieved so far could be improved in the future. Perhaps the Minister might study the document published by the Labour Party entitled <i>From Unemployment to Self-Employment</i> and give us his response to some of the proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will do that.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 10, which deals with carers, there is a broad welcome in our society for the measures the Minister has taken on the representations made by groups such as the Carers Association and CROSSCARE. I note in the recent bulletin Deputies were sent by the carers, that there is serious dissatisfaction among them. For example, they asked the Minister to effectively double the number of carers receiving the allowance to 23,000. Despite the Minister's improvements, they estimate that fewer than 15,000 carers &ndash; or one in four &ndash; are being facilitated. They asked for an increase in the carer's allowance to £100 per week. They want the means test for full-time carers to be abolished; they believe there is no fundamental change in that except for some single carers. They welcome the provision for people caring outside the home. They asked for a carer's benefit for carers who had to give up paid work to care for relatives at home who do not receive anything. They asked for the carer's allowance to be extended to the 9,000 parents of children with severe disabilities. So far we have gone only quarter of the way towards that. They also asked for free medical cards for full-time carers as well as free medical examinations, but they were disappointed in that. The most important request was for a £45 per week carer's financial support to meet the additional costs of caring, but again they were disappointed.</P>
      <P>The general reaction of many people who have profound admiration for our fellow citizens caring for severely disabled citizens is that the Minister has moved some of the way towards meeting the urgent needs of this section of society but that he must go much further. That will mean the provision of significant extra financial resources but the Minister said he wanted to put an end to carers being taken for granted. If the Minister really wants to do that I urge him to go much further in this. If my party gets an opportunity to be in Government in the coming years I hope we will do what we are being urged by the carer groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the farm assist scheme. Has the Minister indicated in the Bill the way the basic income of farm families will be means tested? What will be the timeframe <Col N="535" /> because it appears there is none in the Bill. That is something we may suggest on Committee Stage. Given the current crisis in farming affecting 150,000 families and associated families throughout the country, and the grave threat to the livelihood of rural Ireland, I hope the Minister will interpret the farm assist scheme in a generous way. The Minister has set out detailed elements of the way the scheme will be administered in the Bill but he should do that in the broadest terms.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I represent a number of fishing communities which were a little envious of the developments in farming. While welcoming some of the provisions they believe the Minister should have expanded on this area.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with pensions. I welcome the attempt to move towards the £100 per week target on which commitments were given some years ago to the Irish Seniors Citizens' Parliament and to the trade union seniors group. Many people are anxious to know the input the Minister had into the extraordinary changes the Minister for Finance is making in this area. In May 1998, following the pensions initiative, the Minster sent us an interesting briefing on action on pensions relating in particular to the personal retirement savings account. Did Deputy McCreevy take any notice of some of the ideas in the pensions initiative and on which Deputy Ahern said he would take certain action? The Minister is being pre-empted in this area by Deputy McCreevy and I wonder who is speaking for the Government. Is it the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, as the person with primary responsibility for pensions, or is it the Minister for Finance, for reasons of his own?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions for more flexible pensions for the self-employed but that should be happening in an integrated way. Why have a Pensions Board if its members are not listened to, particularly in circumstances where the Minister for Social Welfare is listened to? The Minister must not allow himself to be ignored by the Minister for Finance. While we are opposed to all fraud, section 26 should be looked at again. The existing powers are perfectly adequate. Taxpayers should be on a level playing pitch with the former members of the golden circle and the 1.3 million citizens who live on social welfare, often in difficult and straitened circumstances. The vast majority of social welfare recipients depend on this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his excellent stewardship of the Social, Community and Family Affairs portfolio. He is doing an excellent job and deserves our acknowledgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can have many philosophical debates about the social welfare system and its impact on the economy but the most important aspect of the system for those dependent on social welfare payments is the money they receive. This Govern<Col N="536" /> ment is committed to real and substantial rates of social welfare payments and this is reflected in the increases in social welfare payments across the board announced in the 1999 budget. The hallmark of the Minister's stewardship of his Department is the movement towards a new definition of social welfare as responsive, flexible and designed to help individuals and groups express their potential, make their contribution and, most importantly, know they are valued by this changing nation.</P>
    <P>Members of this House are aware of the dilemma some people in our constituencies experienced in deciding whether to take up a job opportunity or continue to receive a social welfare payment. That has changed. The significant increases in child benefit along with the increases in family income supplement weekly income thresholds and the period of retention of other secondary benefits go a long way in addressing the difficulties that would have arisen. I welcome these changes and I support relevant initiatives in making participation in the economy attractive.</P>
    <P>As a result of recent measures there is great confidence in the economy and the market place. The Irish spirit of determination and enterprise faces the challenge to succeed at home and abroad with the benefit of EMU and the enlarged European Union. At a time when the economy is doing so well it is hard to comprehend that 200,000 people are still unemployed. Given our economic success, we are experiencing a people shortage in the workplace. While we have increased employment by approximately one third since 1987, with more people in jobs than at any time since Independence, we have sufficient work for almost everyone who wants to work and is willing to participate. I support the view that taking a job, long-term, is the only way to better one's living standard. The best route is to take a job and training is available for all those who need to gain the necessary skills; especially given the social welfare and secondary benefits which can be retained.</P>
    <P>We must try to resolve some of the difficulties experienced by young parents in the workforce. As a young parent whose wife also works outside the home, I am conscious of the budget for outgoings in our home. As most people acknowledge, the two big outgoings for young parents in the workplace are mortgage and child care costs. I have raised the issue of child care in recent years and I welcome the fact that we are moving closer to putting the appropriate measures in place. We can address this problem and we must do so in a fair and even manner to ensure that all parents benefit, whether they work at home or in the workplace. I give an early but cautious welcome to the suggestion that, to fairly address this matter, a generous increase in child benefit to all recipients is the answer. As I have been working closely with the Minister for Finance on this question, I welcome the Minister's determination to have all the relevant reports back to him as <Col N="537" /> quickly as possible to put appropriate and fair structures in place.</P>
    <P>This Government is equally strongly committed to the goal of providing an old age pension of £100 per week. From June of this year the old age contributory pension will be £89 for those under 80 and £94 for those over 80. This is welcome. Older people have made this country what it is today. We owe it to them to make it a good country for older people. It is imperative that they enjoy a fair and generous share in increases in the national wealth arising from the current economic boom. A comprehensive and detailed review should be undertaken this year, the International Year of Older Persons, of all benefits and supports available to older persons in our community with a view to making fundamental improvements in such benefits and supports.</P>
    <P>I salute and pay tribute to the work done by voluntary and community groups and I acknowledge the role of the Citizens' Information Centres and the National Social Services Board.</P>
    <P>I will mention three areas. First, the benefits accruing from the home help service should not be underestimated. There is a clear need to develop this service on a structured basis. The hourly rate of pay, weekend and unsociable hours, PRSI and PAYE deductions, entitlement to social welfare payments all warrant clear guidelines. The job description needs clarification and the required training and support need to be put in place for those working in this service. This wonderful service merits a total overhaul, additional funding and a clearly defined policy statement.</P>
    <P>Second, the potential of an appropriate carer's scheme has not been tapped. I welcome the improvements in qualifying criteria for payments to carers and I acknowledge the submission of CROSSCARE. An immense fund of goodwill exists in our community. We must approach the carer's scheme in a radical and practical way, drawing from the experiences of our communities. Why do we allow an elderly person, not fit for discharge due to social or domestic reasons, to be discharged from an acute hospital? The elderly person may be occupying an acute bed but is it right to discharge such a patient? Why do we allow local authorities to build senior citizen complexes without resident wardens? Why do we pay nursing home subventions and buy contract beds in nursing homes at enormous cost when we all know, in certain circumstances, that it is not necessary? The three Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government should together radically overhaul their positions with a view to introducing a new and appropriate carer's scheme.</P>
    <P>Third, I request the consideration of a new companion scheme. I envisage such a scheme encouraging elderly people, living alone, to consider living together. Consider, for example, an elderly person living alone in the community, dependent on family, friends, home helps, public <Col N="538" /> health nurses, meals on wheels and so on. This person may be living in the old family home, too big for current needs and too expensive to maintain, heat and repair. Next door or just around the corner there may be another elderly person living alone and equally dependent on services. Imagine the multiple benefits that could occur if people in such circumstances lived together. Why not, albeit on a trial basis, encourage elderly people to live together by introducing a totally new and innovative companion scheme with a payment of, perhaps, £50 per week? I have an instinctive feeling that such a companion scheme would be a catalyst for change in our changing society and would release pressure on the provision of services across the community. I earnestly ask the Minister to look at this matter. I assure him of my assistance and of the benefit of my experience as a member of a health board and a local authority and as a legislator.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional income limit for the fuel allowance from £15 to £30 per week and the £500 bereavement grant which replaces the £100 death grant. I tabled a motion on this matter to my parliamentary party. I also welcome the increase in the number of people who will qualify. Recently, to my surprise and disappointment I came across a person who did not qualify for the death grant because the person who died was born before March 1901. I do not understand why this provision was allowed to remain in place. I am pleased to note that the Minister has indicated to me that he intends to table an amendment on Committee Stage to address this issue. While I welcome this, I ask the Minister to bring the £500 bereavement grant forward. A previous speaker spoke of bringing pension and child benefit payments forward to an earlier date than June of this year. I know it is the Minister's intention to bring forward the payment date for increases in benefits. That will involve major budgetary implications. He announced the introduction of a new bereavement grant on 18 February. I ask him to bring forward the payment date of the new grant to 1 January 1999, if not earlier. That would involve a relatively small outlay and demonstrate his determination to bring forward the payment date of all the increases in benefits.</P>
    <P>We have adopted a compassionate and step care approach to building the tremendous social welfare system we have. It has a solid foundation and we have the ability to make it even better. We can all share in it and none need feel alienated from it. Those who have been or are abusing the system are coming under pressure. I have no doubt all Members would agree we must guard against any abuses and call for constant vigilance and positive action in cases of abuse.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the level of moneys being spent in supplementary payments. Some people, who do not have a right to be here, avail of such payments. A major challenge facing us is the issue of illegal immigrants, which we must address in a sensible and reasonable, but proactive, way to prevent people putting their lives <Col N="539" /> and that of their families at risk by being smuggled into this country. Under EU, UN and international regulations and conventions, those people do not have a right to come here. I support measures to assist those in need. We should concentrate our efforts on helping those who are entitled to claim benefit and to have their needs addressed.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the level of expenditure on rent supplements and rent deposits. I urge the Minister to adopt the practical recommendations I put forward in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on our society that we do not have adequate services to respond to the needs of the homeless, the number of whom has escalated. We have begun work to address this problem, but we need to do a good deal more.</P>
    <P>I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Pat Carey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing a wide range of enlightened measures in the social welfare area. It is no accident his Department is called the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The measures introduced since he took office are focused and interlinked and they are having a significant and positive impact on families and on the community.</P>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Broughan's contribution, one would be forgiven for thinking that improvements had not been made since the rainbow coalition left office. He seemed to forget that the old age contributory pension is now £89 per week. It has increased by £11 since the Government took office compared to an increase of £7 when Deputy Broughan's party was in power. Child benefit has increased by £3 in respect of the first two children and by £4 for each subsequent child. That represents an increase of £41 million in a full year compared with £25 million in the last year the rainbow coalition was in office.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on establishing the interdepartmental review group on the carer's allowance. That was an important initiative and resulted in a number of important improvements. I particularly welcome the initiative whereby those who care for children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will be eligible to qualify for the carer's allowance and eligibility will also be extended to the carer of anyone between the ages of 60 and 65 who requires full-time care and attention. The residency conditions for receipt of the allowance and the full-time care and attention rules will also be relaxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the problem of isolation experienced by carers and by those for whom they care. I am glad the Minister was able to extend the free telephone rental scheme to all those in receipt of the carer's allowance and to extend the free travel scheme to carers of those in receipt of the constant attendance allowance <Col N="540" /> and the prescribed relative's allowance. One of the most important changes for many carers will be the annual payment of £200 as a contribution towards respite care for all qualifying carers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callelly adverted to the bereavement grant. I compliment the Minister on introducing that scheme, which has been well received in my constituency. It is extremely welcome that the Minister secured an additional £10 million from the Government to improve a scheme introduced in 1970. Ten thousand grants are payable annually, which involve a total cost of £1 million from the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Section 9 introduces three significant improvements to which the Minister adverted. I welcome the Minister's proposal to address the qualifying conditions for the old age pension. He set up a committee to undertake a comprehensive review of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to old age and retirement pensions. I note from a reply to a question I tabled that the committee is due to report in the first quarter of this year. I am particularly anxious that the pre-1953 contributions issue should be addressed. I appreciate we are not comparing like with like in terms of those and current contribution. Entitlements were different at that time. The pensioners in question are elderly and they subscribed to that scheme in good faith. They thought it would benefit them to a greater extent than it did. It is regrettable that such elderly people are disqualified from full participation in their pension schemes because of what they perceive to be an anomaly or a change in regulations. I urge the Minister to carefully examine the pre-1953 contribution scheme to ascertain what can be done to bring it into line with the current regulations.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on a measure that may have passed unnoticed, although a number constituents have contacted me about it &ndash; the announcement that there will be a special backdating of pension payments, which will benefit approximately 5,000 pensioners. A total of £10 million will be paid to the recipients of widow's, old age and retirement pensions who have delayed entitlement applications. That is greatly welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the community aspect of the Minister's work. I compliment him on the support scheme for voluntary and community organisations. The community development projects which he and his predecessors funded have a major impact on communities. There are three such projects in my constituency, the Finglas South Community Development Project, Project West in Finglas west and a project in Ballymun. They provide an engine to drive major change, development and activity in the community. For a relatively small amount of money these targeted projects generate a major spin-off in terms of facilitating the participation of marginalised groups, including lone parents, women and older people in community programmes.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the support he has given to the INOU centres for the unem<Col N="541" /> ployed. I also welcome the setting up of a helpline for the elderly &ndash; an issue extremely dear to my heart and even dearer to the Minister's heart &ndash; funded by his Department based in Summerhill, County Meath. That pilot project should be developed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on securing Government agreement on drafting legislation to give effect to the establishment of Comhairle, the new agency that will be responsible for the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services for citizens. It will take over some of the functions of the NSSB and the NRB. That type of independent advice ought to be available to all citizens and it may help alleviate our burden of work.</P>
    <P>Free bus passes are issued annually for Dublin city buses. Pensioners and others who use them are entitled only to use the bus pass after 9.45 a.m. and before 4 p.m. I know it is a battle between Dublin Bus and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. However, many hospital appointments, particularly those of elderly people, are before 9.45 a.m. I ask the Minister to review that option at a convenient opportunity.</P>
    <P>I compliment and congratulate the Minister on a job extremely well done. He has introduced a wide range of targeted and focused measures. I hope he is office for a long time to come so that he can introduce more of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this Social Welfare Bill a fair response from a Government which declared itself to be a caring Government, concerned with people's welfare and the needs of those below the poverty line? At a time of plenty, it is a paltry response to the need to alleviate the difficulties and hardships faced by people dependent on social welfare. There is a cynicism in the community, particularly among those who are dependent on social welfare, about what is happening and what has preoccupied the media for the past six or eight months.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to respond much more positively than he has in this Bill. There is an average increase of between £3 and £3.50 in all the schemes mentioned in the Bill. That is totally inadequate if we are to bring people above the poverty line and out of the hardship in which they find themselves at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How widespread is social welfare fraud? The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs initiated a programme of inquiry several years ago and the inspectors found that many people stopped claiming social welfare as a result. The programme was deemed a success for that reason. The Department's inspectors have adequate powers to successfully pursue those <Col N="542" /> making fraudulent claims. I was amazed to hear the Minister say in his speech that the pilot schemes in the seven counties mentioned were initiated at the request of the Garda, in co-operation with other Departments.</P>
    <P>If the Garda have suggested they have no work to do, other than pursue social welfare claimants whom it is believed are making fraudulent claims, I remind the Minister that in Athenry in east Galway raiders spent last weekend within a financial institution until they eventually succeeded in breaking through to an ATM, without the presence of the Garda. I raised in this House last month that there are no gardaí on duty in Athenry from 7 p.m. until duty begins the following day. I was told by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform that there were adequate policing systems. We now find that not only are gardaí escorting money from one financial institution to another, but their time is to be taken up policing a social welfare scheme. I do not think that is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that particular attention is being paid to commercial vehicles. He is less than forthcoming in identifying the people he wants to target in that instance. Many people who use commercial vehicles in their everyday work are to be the target of these inspectors and checkpoints. That is totally unfair and unjust. The Minister should use other methods available to him to identify those making fraudulent social welfare claims.</P>
    <P>The home of an elderly person was raided in Eyrecourt, County Galway, the week before last. The raiders got away with a substantial amount of money, much of it in the old denominations. They were only caught because they tried to pass off this money in certain establishments later that evening.</P>
    <P>I earnestly ask the Minister to consider allowing elderly people to retain increased amounts of savings while still being allowed to claim the old age pension and other entitlements under the Social Welfare Act. There are people who can readily identify elderly people, particularly in rural areas, who because they are afraid to disclose their savings, small although the amount might be, retain them on their premises. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs must take some blame for the fact that many elderly people are being attacked in their homes. When the efficacy of these checkpoints is assessed, I hope the Minister will dismiss them and give the inspectors the powers they need to root out people making fraudulent claims.</P>
    <P>The farm assistance scheme appears to be a duplication of an existing scheme. Unless there is a huge change in the conditions for assessment, other than a reduction from 100 per cent to 80 per cent of the assessment, I can see very little benefit for the farming community. Farm families throughout rural Ireland are in decline. Their incomes have been seriously slashed because of the crisis in agriculture caused by the fall in prices. This farm assistance scheme is nothing <Col N="543" /> more than a rehash of the old assistance scheme; the difference does not make it worthwhile going through the procedures.</P>
    <P>I hope that if the Department and the inspectors who will carry out the assessment are to show any leniency they will relax the demands which have been in place heretofore, so that claims could be easily assessed and claimants will not have to produce their telephone and electricity bills and other receipts in order to qualify. The mountain of red tape will have to be eliminated before anyone can benefit from this scheme. The Minister appears to be making people undergo an endurance test in relation to how long they can wait for subsistence farm social welfare payments. Very few people will benefit from that. I urge him to reconsider allowing elderly people greater flexibility to retain savings in a legitimate banking institution without being penalised for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the many valuable changes outlined in the Social Welfare Bill. Information centres and so on are now more readily available to people than they were in the past.</P>
      <P>I welcome the £6 increase in pension payments. However, although rent levels have increased for many elderly people, the increase will not come into effect until June. The cost of waste collection has also increased. Those in receipt of disability or invalidity benefit will only receive a £3 increase and widows and widowers will also receive a mere £3 increase. Where is the Celtic tiger for these people? I will cite the example of two good friends, one of whom is in his early 60s and is on crutches. He is lucky enough to have a friend living next door to him who is in receipt of a contributory old age pension and who can offer assistance to him in many ways. The contributory old age pensioner received an increase of £11 in the past two years but the person in receipt of the disability payment, who must pay for everything, only received an increase of £6. Where is the justice in that?</P>
      <P>I welcome the improvements in the carer's allowance, the change from domiciliary to carer status for those under 16 years of age and the fact that people aged between 60 and 65 years may be eligible under the scheme. I also welcome the £200 respite payment. Above all, I compliment the Minister on displaying leniency in regard to residence. In rural areas especially, a young couple may build a house close to elderly relatives to offer help and protection to them. That is now being recognised and I hope there is no small print involved there which would prevent them receiving the proper allowance or availing of the benefit of a free telephone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the two years the Minister has been in office, there has not been any increase in income disregard levels for the carer's allowance. Five years ago, £50 of a person's income was disregarded; over the following two years, the figure was increased to £150 but it has not increased since. I <Col N="544" /> accept that single people have received an allowance but if we are to make the carer's scheme work, it is important to recognise the valuable service carers provide which prevents many elderly people having to go into nursing homes and so on.</P>
    <P>The issue of voluntary housing must also be given urgent attention by the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs to ensure that elderly people receive meals and have a warden service, thereby avoiding the necessity for many of them to go into long-term care.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the farming sector is an issue of particular concern to me. The Minister has promised to provide a new farm assist scheme to replace the family income supplement payment. The payment will come into effect on 1 April but will not be paid until June.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fodder scheme. I tried to raise this issue on the Order of Business today. In the first week of October, farmers were promised assistance. Some of them received it but the majority of those entitled to it still only have a promise. A promise does not provide meal, fodder or straw for dying animals. The people looking after such animals are under severe pressure and some are almost suicidal. Yet, we appear to be waiting for the crisis to pass or for the farming community to address it. The Minister should urge his colleagues to implement the fodder scheme immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also consider the issue of means testing in regard to the farm assist scheme. The scheme does not appear to make any allowance for decreases in income, cattle prices and so on. I have three lists of farm profiles outlining many people who have tried to get on to the scheme and others who have got on it but have been put off again. One person was found to be ineligible because his son lives with him and under TB regulations &ndash; which have nothing to do with income levels &ndash; he is not allowed a second herd number. The community welfare officer accepted that the cattle belonged to the man in question but had no way of proving it because all of the animals were in the one herd. This is bureaucracy gone mad. If we are to ensure the survival of farmers, we must change that regulation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase from £100 to £500 in the bereavement grant and the inclusion of children under the scheme. The Minster stated that he introduced the increase because he had encountered a case of severe hardship. There are many such cases and the Minister must take them into consideration. We have a Celtic tiger economy and many people are in employment. Surely we can help those at the lowest levels of our society? </P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised the issue of people who had paid PRSI for a number of years. Those payments will now be recognised and I thank the Minister for taking action in this area. People who have paid between five and ten years' contri<Col N="545" /> butions will receive a 50 per cent allowance. It will be very difficult to tell someone who has paid almost ten years' contribution but who is two days away from a particular date that he or she will be treated in the same way as someone who has only paid five years' contributions. I urge the Minister to consider some kind of compromise in this area in the final draft of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche has spoken a great deal in recent days about tightening the screws on people who have money in financial institutions. The rule introduced by the Minister for Finance is certainly sending out the wrong message. People are now afraid to keep their money in banks. I want to ensure that fraud is tackled but it is important that those at the lower end of the scheme are not forced to keep money in the house rather than in the banks, building societies, etc. It is difficult to explain to somebody with a couple of thousand pounds in the bank that he will be investigated, when we see tribunals discussing millions of pounds and people being handed £50,000 for nothing, for which we are told, no service was given.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to re-examine the position regarding money which people are allowed have in institutions and not to scare them. The system of interest charges is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Foley. I welcome the Social Welfare Bill as it implements the changes announced in the budget which will cost £317 million in a full year. I compliment the Minister for ensuring that people who depend on social welfare for their livelihood will benefit from the success of the economy. I have known the Minister for a long time. He is compassionate, caring and concerned. It is obvious from his work since his appointment as Minister that he has targeted available resources towards the people who need them.</P>
      <P>We have a higher standard of living then ever and we owe a debt of gratitude to those who are now retired, the elderly who, in many ways, have made a great contribution to our present prosperity. I am glad the Minister recognised this and that in two budgets he has been responsible for an increase of £11 per week in old age pensions &ndash;  an increase of £6 per week this year and of £5 per week in 1998. It is reasonable to compare that with what the previous Government did, when old age pensioners received an increase of £7 per week over a three year period. Since Deputy Ahern became Minister, a married couple, for example, is £15.50 per week better off. We are moving towards the promised rate of £100 per week by 2002, the final year the Government will be in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the decision of the Minister to provide pensions for the self-employed who were 56 years of age in 1988 when the new scheme for the self-employed was introduced. I listened carefully to Deputy Crawford and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. I do not know whether Deputy O'Keeffe raised this issue when his party was in <Col N="546" /> Government a short time ago, but the previous Government did nothing to alleviate the difficulty which existed for the self-employed who did not qualify because they were over 56 years in 1988.</P>
    <P>I welcome the many beneficial and enlightened changes in the carer's allowance, costing £18 million, an increase of 40 per cent. I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of disregarding further income &ndash; indeed all income &ndash; where the person being cared for is totally dependent, as in the case of somebody suffering from Alzheimer's disease or paralysis. Such people need attention 24 hours a day, with feeding and everything having to be done for them. The number of people who would qualify in this category would be small. There are precedents for taking high dependency into account in legislation covering private nursing homes. From time to time one sees people, generally women, looking after elderly persons, perhaps in-laws, who are totally dependent and the carer is unable to leave the house. Because the husband is a garda or is earning more than £300 per week the carer does not qualify for the carer's allowance. Perhaps the Minister will examine this issue.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the farm assist scheme and the decision of the Minister to bring forward the date of implementation to 1 April. The scheme will be very beneficial to the farming community. We all recognise &ndash; particularly those of us representing rural constituencies &ndash; the current difficulties being experienced by small farmers as a result of the economic crisis in Russia and the bad weather which resulted in the fodder crisis and which created extraordinary difficulties for small farmers. Section 16 sets out the method of assessment for the scheme. It provides that a farmer's income will be assessed at a rate of 80 per cent, while £100 will be disregarded for the first two children and £200 for each child after that. This will be very much welcomed.</P>
    <P>The rural community and farmers have always been suspicious of investigating officers. The overwhelming majority of people have nothing to fear. In my experience as a medical doctor and a politician I know that many such people do not apply for the benefit to which they are entitled because they fear the investigation. We must ensure that people who need the extra income provided by the farm assist scheme apply for it. In that context I welcome the decision of the IFA to appoint liaison officers who will try to ensure farmers apply for the scheme.</P>
    <P>On the capital moneys people have in banks and the method of assessment, the Minister explained this a number of times during Question Time and I do not have a difficulty with that. However, I have a difficulty with the banks. It is wrong for a bank to invest capital from the sale of a farm &ndash; perhaps the result of the farmer moving to a town &ndash; at less than 1 per cent. Current interest rates on medium or long-term deposits are low enough, but it is wrong for a bank to take £60,000, £70,000 or £80,000 from a small farmer who, perhaps for the only time in his life is involved in a major transaction, without telling <Col N="547" /> him he can invest the entire amount or a portion of it for six months, 12 months or five years at a higher interest rate. Farmers who are not told this find they receive a negligible sum in terms of what is necessary to live while they are not entitled to receive social welfare benefit due to the capital invested.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 500 per cent increase in bereavement grant and the fact that people who left employment before 1970 and who were not previously included will be included in the scheme when they fulfil the other conditions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the relaxation of the rules for lone parents who are temporarily absent from the State. I ask the Minister to examine the conditions for receipt of benefit, particularly in the context of deserted wives.</P>
    <P>While I fully support any efforts the Minister takes to eliminate fraud from the system &ndash; I know schemes are liable and that we must always be on the lookout for fraud &ndash; I am satisfied that a considerable number of lone parents, particularly deserted wives, are not able to meet the conditions, especially the condition of having to pursue their husbands because they do not have the resources if they have three or four young children. Free legal aid is not easily available and, in some instances, because of domestic violence in the past, they are afraid to pursue their spouse. Will the Minister see if something can be done to ensure lone parents who are entitled to the benefit receive it without the type of difficulty I described. I compliment the Minister on what is an excellent Bill and I have no doubt many people will benefit from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister. He is a caring Minister and he has proved this by introducing this comprehensive and positive Bill which gives effect to the substantial improvement in the social welfare rates of payments announced in the budget. Included in the Bill is a major package of improvements for carers. It also introduces new income support measures for farmers and fishermen on low incomes as well as increasing the bereavement grant from £100 to £500. This is a substantial increase as 10,000 grants are payable each year.</P>
      <P>Under section 4, the Minister has provided that the funeral grant payable under the occupational injuries scheme will also be increased to £500. He is extending the scope of the scheme to include other insured persons such as the self-employed and those covered by the modified rate of social insurance, for example, public servants. At present, the scheme is largely confined to employees who pay the full rate of PRSI contributions. It makes no sense that people in such categories cannot qualify for a death grant but may qualify for a widows or widowers contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> I welcome the easement of the contribution condition so as many people as possible can qualify under the scheme. The present conditions require the insured person to have a minimum of 26 contributions paid since starting work or since 1 October 1970 and to have either 48 contributions paid or credited in a recent income tax year or an average of 48 contributions paid per year since October 1970 since starting work. The death grant should be payable to insured people with a minimum level of contributions paid under the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the recent changes to the social welfare system which will benefit low income/self-employed fishermen and take effect from the first week in April 1999. This major change has come about following detailed discussions between the Minister and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods. They have agreed to the new arrangement which will be known as fishing assist. Fishing assist is a substantial response from the Government to the difficulties experienced in the fisheries sector during periods of prolonged bad weather, mainly focused on fishermen who operate out of small inshore boats, the group most seriously affected by adverse weather conditions. They are the most vulnerable people in our coastal communities and both Ministers are to be congratulated on bringing forward a scheme to assist these fishermen.</P>
    <P>The provisions include changes to the income support arrangements for fishermen which are as follows: 80 per cent of all income from self-employment will be assessed rather than 100 per cent as has been the case heretofore; child related income disregards of £100 per annum for the first two qualified children to £200 per annum for the third and subsequent children and relaxation of the signing on arrangements. It is expected that some 500 low income self-employed fishermen will benefit from the fishing assist measure which will cost up to £1 million in the full year.</P>
    <P>The farm assist scheme for low income farmers is to be welcomed. The new scheme is designed specially for farmers on low incomes and replaces the existing small holders assistance scheme. The scheme will be means tested taking into account both the farm income and off-farm self-employment of farmers and spouse. Farmers will not be required to sign on to avail of the new scheme. Eligibility will be based on the actual income assessed being within the specified income threshold. As in the case of fishermen, only 80 per cent of income assessed will be taken into account and there will also be child related disregard.</P>
    <P>Existing farmers can apply at any time to have their means reassessed for small holders unemployment assistance if they consider that their income position has deteriorated since their means were last reviewed. The new farm assist scheme will benefit in the region of 13,400 farm families. This includes the existing 6,600 small holders and a further 6,800 low income farmers.</P>
    <P>As regards pensions for self employed, <i>pro rata</i> pensions will be made available to many self-<Col N="549" /> employed persons who were over the age of 56 when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1998 and who, as a result, did not qualify for a contributory old age pension. The new pension will be paid to self-employed persons with at least five years contributions since becoming self-employed contributors. It will be paid at 50 per cent of the personal rate plus 50 per cent of the qualified adult allowance and child dependant rates, where applicable.</P>
    <P>A couple will, for example, receive a pension of £72.25 per week. This scheme will be introduced in October 1999 and will be back dated to April as arrears of payment from April to October, where due, will be paid at that stage. This group of pensioners will now also have access to the free schemes. Up to 10,000 people approximately, 8,000 pensioners and 2,000 qualified adults, will benefit from this measure at an estimated cost of £18 million in a full year. The total estimated cost of this measure in the future will be £170 million.</P>
    <P>The carers allowance has been boosted by £18 million on top of the existing £45 million. The fundamental proposals include: carers allowance to be extended to carers of children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance; carers allowance to be payable subject to a means test to carers of all people between 16 and 65 years of age who require full-time care and attention; an annual payment of £200 towards respite care for all qualified carers; free telephone rental allowance to all qualified carers and full-time care and attention conditions relaxed. Other proposals include: carers to have income disregard in their own right; carers social insurance records to be preserved and free travel scheme to all qualified carers, including new categories.</P>
    <P>In the programme for Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats clearly outline their determination to address the issues of exclusion and poverty. This Bill is a reaffirmation of the commitment and addresses a wide range of improvements for older people, carers, families and communities and measures to help the long-term unemployed back to work.</P>
    <P>This Bill also contains an amendment to Part VIII of the Pensions Act, 1990, to prevent companies taking advantage of increases in social welfare. This amendment has been welcomed by SIPTU as it will act as a safeguard for employees concerned that their State pension might cause employers to reduce pension provisions for employees. The personal rate of old age contributory pension and retirement pension have been increased to £89 per week. Disability, unemployment, injury and health and safety benefits have been increased to £73.50 per week, and the weekly allowance paid with these benefits has been increased to £43.20 per week.</P>
    <P>Part-time workers  &ndash; up to ten hours &ndash; who are resident carers will not be disqualified from the carers allowance. The new means testing arrangement will allow for a carer to earn up to £75 per week and still avail of the carers allow<Col N="550" /> ance. Other improvements include free travel allowance for those in receipt of carers allowance. Those providing care to those in receipt of constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance will qualify for a free travel pass. There will also be an increase in child benefit and family income supplement, FIS. Those in receipt of child benefit rates will receive £34.50 each for the first two children and £46 for the third and subsequent children. The increase in the weekly rate of maternity and adoptive benefit to £86.70 will come into effect in June 1999.</P>
    <P>As regard people with disabilities, the back to education allowance will be available from age 18 onwards. People going into hospital or institutional care will still receive disability allowance. The number of places will increase from 27,000 to 29,000. The special project fund will be increased by £100,000. The national pilot programmes for those unemployed for five years or more involves six weeks on-the-job training with a £25 weekly travel and meals allowance and 1,000 back-to-work allowance places will be reserved for people on pilot schemes. This will include those receiving one-parent family payments, disability allowance and blind persons pensions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is in the House to hear the response of Deputies from all sides to this Bill and it is to be hoped an even more positive Social Welfare Bill will appear next year. We fully support the Minister in his role following the introduction of this year's budget. We are on the brink of Agenda 2000 and of creating a new national programme which is expected to tackle mainstream social exclusion and inequality. We have a burgeoning economy which allows us to plan, support and provide subventions which could not be provided previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The brunt of the sacrifices in the past were made by the disadvantaged. Social welfare, encompassing issues of family and community affairs, must be about social inclusion. Social <Col N="551" /> inclusion strategies must target groups identified in the national anti-poverty programme &ndash; the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed; children, particularly those in large families; single-adult households and households headed by a person working in the home; lone parents; those with disabilities; travellers; older people and women.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that these categories impinge more on women, on the sacrifices made by women and on the disadvantages they subsequently suffer. Many women cannot seek employment or training because they do not qualify as they are not on the live register.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have correctly stated that we owe our economic success, welfare and the standards and values of our society to those who went before us. It should be particularly noted that we owe a debt of gratitude to women who, for a long time, had no choice but to work in the home and who did so at great sacrifice to their social welfare entitlements. This is the area on which I wish to concentrate.</P>
    <P>Women are top of the list of categories identified by the national anti-poverty strategy. They have contributed at every level but have gained the least financially. There must be a concentrated effort to provide access for women to training schemes, employment and mechanisms of upskilling their current positions which may be the cause of their becoming redundant. Avon Arlington in Portarlington is in a sector which has traditionally employed many women as it was seen as women's work. As a result the impact of the closure of this and many other industries, such as those in the textile sector, has a far greater impact on women. We must make a concentrated effort in terms of social welfare and employment and training to ensure that these women are quickly, efficiently, effectively and positively included in a system in which they are needed.</P>
    <P>I will continue to argue in this session about the issue of child care and the misinterpretation and lack of understanding of this issue. I have heard middle class pundits and journalists dismiss the debate on child care as a middle class concern by well-heeled, working parents who, presumably, are considered to be top of the heap and should not be asking for any concessions. I am disappointed that much of the critical analysis of the national child care strategy was negated and sidelined by editorials and journalist who only concentrated on what they viewed as a privilege. Their assessment seems to be that properly qualified, registered child care is a privilege which would apply only to some and would heavily disadvantage others, particularly women in the home and those in poor households.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, the first concern of the Goodbody report, and the report of the expert working group on child care, was that this issue should be Government policy and that it was a matter of social justice. Both reports noted that large sub<Col N="552" /> ventions, particularly from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, would have to be invested to ensure good quality child care.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations of the child care group are: to support low income families not in the tax net to access quality child care services; to support low earners who would not benefit from the tax relief measures recommended in the report; to increase ceilings for lone parents payments and to remove disincentives for lone parents who cannot afford child care. This deprives the child of the social and educational development it rightly deserves but also prevents lone parents from seeking employment and independence outside the home. I wish to express the indignation of many homemakers at the fact that we seem to believe that good quality child care is an extra and an appendage. One psychiatrist has stated that such child care services would represent the State taking over the care of our children and I will not even bother commenting on that suggestion.</P>
    <P> The Goodbody report, and the recommendations of the expert working group, noted the benefits to be derived from investing in children, particularly those from disadvantaged areas, from an early age. They stated that we should provide qualified, registered child care which an increase in child benefit will not provide. An increase in child benefit is required, but that would merely recognise and, to a certain extent, value the work of parents in the home. There is a need to consider childcare as a right in the same way as primary school education is recognised. It must also receive investment.</P>
    <P>Long term monitoring was carried out in the United States of the development of disadvantaged children who availed of pre-school classes, usually from the age of three. Their development was tracked up to the age of 28 and it was established that the programme provided significant benefits in terms of lifetime earnings and reduced crime. Overall the evaluation found that the cost-benefit ratio was in excess of seven, that is, for every dollar spent on the programme, the economy benefited to the extent of $7. It is also worth noting that the benefits to the taxpayer arising from reduced criminality, higher tax payments consequent on higher incomes and reduced expenditure on education accounted for 80 per cent of the total benefits.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make a big investment in this area. The interdepartmental committee that has been established, in which his Department is involved, should radically and fundamentally change our attitude to childcare, which is in crisis and a national disgrace. It should not be necessary in the next budget debate to try to validate the real needs of and the crisis in childcare. It should not be necessary to seek value for the women who give so much of their time as parents in the home and who do not even have contributions in their own right which will give them a pension. I will return to this matter. I have <Col N="553" /> fought that case since I was first elected to this House but, sadly, it still needs to be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Several of my colleagues referred to the carers allowance. I welcome the announcement of the £200 respite care allowance. However, on further reading it appears it is only available to qualified carers. To be a qualified carer, one must be in receipt of a carers allowance. I have been in politics for some time and I have not met many people who qualified for a carers allowance.</P>
      <P>I knew a person whose receipt of the allowance resulted in her husband's pension being reduced to £3 a week. She considered this so demeaning to her husband that she returned the allowance. We can do better. The man involved worked all his life for his pension and then helped at home in caring for a handicapped son over many years. This is not how carers should be treated.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, and the subsequent carers report, recommended two types of payment to carers. The first could be means tested and the other would disregard income and be a recognition of the contribution and work of carers in the home, who are primarily women. We could begin by giving the £200 respite care allowance which makes such a difference. It may be only a few hours respite a week or a few days a year, but it makes life bearable for people who are caring 24 hours a day. I ask the Minister to consider this aspect.</P>
      <P>I again ask the Minister to consider the anomaly which exists for public service pensioners of which many people may not be aware. These pensioners are discriminated against because for many years they paid a modified amount of PRSI. They were not allowed pay any more and as a result they do not qualify for a social welfare pension. They do not expect to qualify for that pension, but it is the qualifier for all the non-cash benefits, such as free electricity, free television rental, free telephone and a medical card. Many of these older pensioners live in very poor circumstances and as they get older, their health costs increase.</P>
      <P>This problem was recognised by the former Minister, Deputy De Rossa. He raised the eligibility threshold to the level of a social welfare pension plus £30 a week. It is time to increase that allowance and, perhaps, abolish the financial qualification. Given the continued growth of the economy, we can afford to give all our pensioners these non-cash benefits. It could be introduced on a phased basis by allowing people over the age of 75 who are living alone to qualify. It is inherently unjust that 80 year old public service pensioners are paying tax, PRSI, health and training and employment levies while their next door neighbours are in much better circumstances with occupational and social welfare pensions and also qualify for the non-cash benefits. I ask the Minister to consider this matter. These benefits should be a right for all our older citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rent and mortgage assistance scheme is <Col N="554" /> payable to people who cannot afford to house themselves. This is a very good scheme and much money is spent on it. It is an efficient way of providing housing to people who cannot house themselves. However, from my membership of the county council and the health board I am aware of major problems in the implementation of the scheme. One relates to the overall maximum which is payable in a given week or month and the other is that it is only payable to people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>IBEC and the Small Firms Association complain that they cannot get workers although many people are drawing unemployment benefit. However, this is one of the reasons. People will not only not take up jobs, but they are leaving jobs because of the rising cost of rent and the difficulty of securing housing. If we want to reduce the level of social welfare payments and the number of people on the dole, provide workers for the economy and solve the housing shortage, the problems with this scheme must be examined. The underlying principles of the scheme are good, but it is not operating as it was intended in the new context of much higher rents and the housing shortage. I ask the Minster to reconsider this issue.</P>

      <P>A Bill which promises an extra £305.5 million in one year is a recognition that everybody in our buoyant economy is being helped. Some people are capable of earning more but everybody depends on getting more. In many cases, the State provides for those people. In our Action Programme for the Millennium we talk about an inclusive society and meeting our commitments under Partnership 2000. An inclusive society does not mean setting minimum standards. It does not mean bringing people up from the dregs of poverty, and it does not mean basic payments. It means sharing the benefits of our economy with everybody, recognising the contribution people make to our society, and identifying need and valuing everybody's role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some aspects of this Bill which have been highlighted by other speakers are worthy of being highlighted again. Taken in conjunction with the Finance Bill, the measures introduced for the elderly are particularly welcome. There are major improvements. We are definitely on the way to a pension of £100 per week for our senior citizens. The fact that the Minister has given an increase of £11 over two years is a fitting recognition of <Col N="555" /> our senior citizens. It is a real increase, unlike previous ones, and it values people's role.</P>
    <P>What I am impressed by &ndash; although it does not come under the Social Welfare Bill, it does deal with the elderly &ndash; are the changes in the medical card guidelines. The cost of medical care, particularly for the elderly, has escalated beyond control, to the extent that in my constituency a doctor in one area will charge £20 for a visit and the same doctor, when he moves his clinic to another area in the constituency, charges £25 per visit. This is beyond the reach of people, particularly the elderly. The extensive changes in that area and in pensions within this Bill are therefore to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at another scheme under his control, that is, security measures and socially monitored alarms. Even though there has been a reduction in crime, elderly people still feel vulnerable. They are not influenced by figures. They are influenced by their own fears and inhibitions. A Chubb lock on the door &ndash; it does not have to be a full scale alarm &ndash; gives the necessary confidence and reassurance to old people. I would like the Minister, where possible, to continue to extend the security scheme and the funding he gives to different groups.</P>
    <P>When the history of Irish women is written, I have no doubt we will find that in almost every family in Ireland was one woman, unmarried, who dedicated her life to caring for elderly parents. Which of us in this House does not have an aunt or other relation that we can identify as being in that position? The tradition developed over the years of people devoting their lives to looking after disabled adults and children and becoming full-time carers but never getting proper recognition. The recognition given in this Bill is a major step forward, particularly now that 3,500 carers will receive benefit for the first time.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in carers of children who are generally mothers. They will now be eligible for the first time. The mother who had to pay her own bus fare to bring her Down's syndrome boy to a match will now qualify for free travel as well. These are small benefits that make life more bearable and comfortable for people. I remember attending a meeting in Dunmore House with fellow Deputies at which the parents talked about respite care. The £200 being provided will certainly help, but I appeal to the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that places are available. The £200 will go some way towards helping to pay for much needed respite but not if there are no places.</P>
    <P>In regard to families and children, child benefit is being increased to £34.50 per month for the first and second child and £46 for the third child, and this is a welcome increase. However, given that the cost of full-time day care for a baby is £115 per week, that is, £460 per month, £34.50 does not go very far. The advantage of child benefit is that it goes to the mother. Whatever is being considered in regard to child care and child <Col N="556" /> benefit, I hope that aspect will not be changed, because there is no guarantee that any of the income of a spouse, where there is a spouse, goes to the mother.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis in child care which needs to be recognised immediately. I do not mean to be divisive, but if parents were cattle and children fodder the crisis would have been recognised long ago and something would have been done about it. It is a multi-departmental issue and needs to be dealt with on that basis. I held a meeting in Dún Laoghaire, at which we could not agree on any one approach to child care. Neither can the national childcare strategy agree on an approach. Even within my own party, there are members who say child benefit is the way to go, because every mother benefits, yet the national childcare strategy does not recommend that as the way forward because it is expensive, not targeted on child care and not guaranteed to increase the provision of child care places or to improve the quality of child care without a parallel investment.</P>

      <P>They are recommending a wide range of measures which I would support. These include child care subsidies, family income support, increasing the income ceiling for one-parent family payment, personal tax relief, removal of benefit-in-kind and so on. When the report came out we were all critical that no immediate action was taken. As I learn more, read more and listen more, I understand that the best way forward is for the interdepartmental group to work together. I look forward to their recommendations. This is a complex area and child benefit is just one aspect of it. It is at least a help to parents who can decide how best to spend the money, whether it is on putting food on the table or on care outside the home.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that there is no division between mothers working full-time in the home and mothers working full-time outside the home. At least 17 per cent of mothers working full-time in the home avail of care outside, so this is an issue which affects everybody. What is divisive in this debate is that the costs in rural areas are less than in the city. Equally the facilities in rural areas are very bad compared to those in the city, and much work needs to be done on that.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs will play a strong role in the debate at the interdepartmental committee, because so much of the work which has already been undertaken is being done through his Department, helping young parents who are taking part in educational schemes or who are in receipt of the family income supplement and so on. Without being critical of the Minister, I would highlight that child care is an issue about which we will hear much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barnes focused particularly on women. I hope it is not just the women in this House who focus on women. In talking about carers and child <Col N="557" /> benefit we are talking about women and at last that has been recognised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and, in particular, the increases for senior citizens and carers. The increase of £6 a week for pensioners aged 66 and over and for people on retirement or invalidity pension aged 65 and over is most welcome. This represents an increase of between 7.2 per cent and 8.3 per cent, a multiple of the rate of inflation. We must also take into account the increase in the income guideline for medical card eligibility. Over the next three years the guideline will double; one-third of the increase will be implemented this year from 1 March. In one ward of my constituency, more than 29 per cent of the electorate is over 65 years of age so the change in the income guideline is extremely welcome there.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it is amazing how well received the training on computers for the elderly scheme was and is being received. The Department will probably find that the money allocated for the scheme will be used quite quickly and I hope further allocations will be made as the need for the scheme is further demonstrated.</P>
      <P>There is an increase in the income threshold for the family income supplement of £8. This, combined with the use of net income, after payment of tax and PRSI, rather than gross income in calculating the weekly income will result in a significant increase in the family income supplement payable to many families. However, there are still many families who do not avail of the supplement. Mechanisms must be put in place in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that all potential participants in FIS are informed of their rights, assisted in applying for the scheme and are helped in every way to ensure they receive the benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>In addition to praising the Minister for the many good provisions in the Bill, I am obliged to draw his attention to a number of anomalies which I hope he will address. There is an anomaly within the FIS system which should be dealt with. A mother of seven children in my constituency who is on a community employment scheme and receiving social payments is earning slightly less than the recommended income level for a family with seven children. We are prepared to accept tax from that person, in the amount of £40 per week, yet she is unable to benefit from the family income supplement. The Minister should consider this problem and find out if appropriate changes can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another anomaly which came to my attention is the payment of a late spouse's pension after death. Widows or widowers with spouses who were in receipt of non-contributory pensions receive six weeks payment of a late spouse's pension while widows and widowers of spouses who were in receipt of contributory pensions receive nothing. This is a most unfair anomaly, particularly when one considers that the recipients of <Col N="558" /> contributory pensions paid for their benefits while recipients of non-contributory pensions did not. The Minister should give his attention to this matter at the earliest convenience.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin expressed the hope that men as well as women would espouse the causes of women in this debate. Since I was first elected to this House, I have taken every opportunity to raise the issue of fairness and equity in the treatment of married mothers <i>vis-à-vis</i> unmarried mothers. While I would never deny unmarried mothers the benefits and payments they receive through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the community employment schemes and the health boards, I wish to ensure that married mothers are treated equitably and that the benefits and opportunities for married mothers do not compare unfavourably to those for unmarried mothers.</P>
    <P>I rang the Department today on this issue. I had tried its website for the past two days but could not get through. There appears to be a problem with it which is unfortunate given the introduction of this legislation in the House. However, I was told by the Department that it receives an enormous number of telephone calls from married mothers complaining about the unfair treatment they believe they receive.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that it is more economic to care for two adults in a family than for one adult. For this reason it is normal that a 60 per cent basis applies to adult dependants, who are mainly married mothers. In the economic circumstances that pertain at present, where budget surpluses are the norm, there is an opportunity to increase that 60 per cent ratio and to give married mothers an increase which would accord them the recognition and status their contribution deserves.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the family unit is the basis of society and that this unit must be supported and maintained. Unmarried mothers are entitled to earn up to £230.76 while retaining some of their benefits, albeit on a graduated scale. Married mothers, however, are only allowed to earn up to £105 while retaining some of their benefits. There is a further anomaly. For every £5 that an unmarried mother earns above £115, she is allowed to keep a further £2.50 of her benefit whereas a married mother is allowed to keep only 50p for every extra £5 she earns over £60. That is unfair and inequitable and must be tackled.</P>
    <P>By using the 60 per cent ratio of the £230 an unmarried mother is allowed to earn, the amount a married mother could earn without her benefits being fully removed should be at least £138 per week. Furthermore, as I suggested earlier, the 60 per cent threshold should be increased, probably to 75 per cent. The child dependant allowance for an unmarried mother is £15.20 per week whereas the child dependant allowance for a married mother is £13.20. I cannot understand that. Every child needs the same amount of food, love and <Col N="559" /> attention. That anomaly should certainly be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are also anomalies with regard to the community employment scheme. A married mother who has looked after her children and put them through school might wish to return to working outside the home. In many cases, particularly where the women are from low income families or from families dependent on social welfare, the skills of the married mother would not be in the super technological bracket. Many of the community employment schemes, therefore, would be ideal placements for these women. However, they are not allowed to participate in such schemes because they have not been in receipt of a social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>Today, I learned about the spouse swap scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of the husband receiving the full benefit payment plus the adult dependant allowance, the married mother gets the major amount and the husband gets the qualified adult allowance. The spouse, in this case the wife, is therefore on a social welfare payment and would be entitled to go on a community employment scheme. It should be easier for married mothers who wish to return to work to get on community employment schemes.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a further suggestion &ndash; that on a once off basis unmarried mothers, should they marry, receive a dowry from the State. This dowry would consist of graduated payments over the first five years of their married life ranging from 100 per cent of the one parent family payment in the first year, 80 per cent in the second, 60 per cent in the third and 40 per cent in the fourth to 20 per cent in the fifth. This is not a new idea. It is not long ago that women who left the Civil Service received a marriage gratuity from the State.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The budget was introduced in early December and we are now dealing with the Social Welfare Bill. However, it is shameful that social welfare recipients will not receive the benefits of the budget provisions until May, June and, in some cases, September. At a time when our economy is doing so <Col N="560" /> well and we had a billion pound surplus in the preceding year, we should have made an effort to implement the social welfare increases more quickly. Already, the rent of some local authority houses has increased. When these tenants receive their increase in social welfare, about 50 per cent will already have been clawed back by local authorities through increased rent. This is not fair to social welfare recipients and I hope the Minister will do something about it.</P>
      <P>In Britain, social welfare increases announced in the budget are in the pockets of those entitled to them much sooner than here. I do not know why this is the case. Perhaps it is because traditionally we have a long lead-in time; it has nothing to do with printing books etc. as that can be done quickly. It is very disappointing.</P>
      <P>On the carer's allowance, there was disappointment among carers when the budget was announced. There were a few fringe benefits for them; the respite care allowance of £200 per annum is worthwhile. However, carers are disappointed there was no substantial increase in the allowance paid to them for the tremendous work they do. There are still some anomalies in the system. For example, a case I encountered recently is with the Department and, perhaps, some of the officials present will take an interest in it. It relates to a bachelor in my area who is terminally ill. He has two sisters, one lives in Florida and the other in Kildare. For many months they have taken turns to mind him. They live in his home and look after him for two months at a time. The American has applied for the carer's allowance. She has to meet huge additional costs to come to look after her brother; the return airfare every eight weeks and also costs relating to her family in Florida. A retired nurse she is of reasonably modest means. However, she does not satisfy the Department's means test.</P>
      <P>I asked the Department to take a special interest in this case and I will be interested in its response. Will it stick rigidly to the guidelines or will a certain amount of flexibility be applied to such a case? These ladies are giving up a substantial amount of their family time at great inconvenience to themselves to honour the wish of their brother who wants to remain at home, come what may. I hope the Department will take a sympathetic view of their case and, perhaps, the senior officials present may have an input in deciding, with compassion, the merits of it.</P>
      <P>I regularly come across people who work part-time while looking after a moderately incapacitated relative in their own home. They may work outside the home, at night or when someone else is present with their relative and, because of that they are barred from availing of the carer's allowance. Amendments have been tabled to the Bill and I hope they will improve it. To allow someone work outside the home for ten hours is a small concession. I hope the Minister will look at this to see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with some of the anomalies which exist in the social welfare code. I compliment Deputy Ardagh on his contribution. He <Col N="561" /> made a valid point about the treatment of women under the social welfare code. Often, married women feel they are discriminated against. Deputy Ardagh eloquently outlined some of the anomalies and how they impinge financially on those women. He mentioned the FIS. One anomaly in the FIS should be highlighted. If a person in receipt of FIS gets a wage increase, there is no benefit whatsoever within certain limits, because he or she is usually in the small income discretion range of income tax, paying tax on 40 per cent. The FIS payment is clawed back at the rate of 60 pence in the pound so an increase in wages does not give him or her a net benefit. This anomaly, which has been brought to the attention of the Department on many occasions, should be dealt with. Although the system has improved these anomalies still exist.</P>
    <P>There is a further anomaly as regards old age pensions. I received a letter from a constituent who retired four years and is in receipt of the old age contributory pension. He is entitled to a maintenance allowance of £52.50 for his wife and a total of £135.50 for both of them. His wife is entitled to free optical benefit and a hearing aid grant on his PRSI contributions. In December 1998 his wife reached 66 years of age and was entitled, in her own right, because she had some social welfare contributions &ndash; for an average of 16 paid weeks she paid PRSI &ndash; to the old age pension at the rate of £62.30. This gave a combined pension for both of them of £145.30. However, the sting in the tail came on 1 January 1999 when his wife applied for a hearing aid grant and optical benefit. She was informed that because she had a pension of more than £60 per week, she was not entitled to claim on her husband's PRSI or her own PRSI because she only had an average of 16 weeks' PRSI and she would need 48 weeks to qualify for such benefits. Had his wife applied before 31 December 1998 she would have qualified for the benefits on her husband's PRSI. However, because she waited until she had her own pension, she is no longer entitled to them. Is it fair that this woman should lose out on those benefits because she is receiving a contributory pension? This should be looked at. I referred the case to the Department and I hope something will be done about it.</P>
    <P>I regret that the increase in child benefit is negligible. Various studies have shown that child benefit is the best method of giving money to less well-off families and is more likely to be used to benefit children. It is an excellent way of getting money to people who need it badly. Unfortunately, this Government has not seen fit to increase child benefit. This should be looked at and, perhaps, the Minister will relent at this late stage and grant an increase in child benefit. In recent months, I came across a statistic which showed that about 60 per cent of the recipients of child benefit have that as the only income in their name.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make it a criminal offence to advertise for sale, offer for sale or sell a ticket for a musical, sporting or theatrical event above its face value. Ireland has a history of ticket touting or scalping. However, there is no law against touts selling tickets at hugely inflated prices. The problem has never been properly addressed by the authorities and they have turned a blind eye to this so-called form of free market commercialism.</P>
      <P>Many sporting organisations have tried in a vain attempt to combat the practice by taking action against members who make tickets available to touts. The Gaelic Athletic Association requests that people who purchase tickets from a tout to inform the organisation of the ticket number. This can then be used to determine who received the ticket and how it ended up in his or her hands. The Football Association of Ireland tries to trace touted tickets back to the original recipients to ensure that they do not receive ticket allocations in future. However, these measures by sporting organisations and concert promoters have failed to stamp out ticket touting. Stronger legislation and the provision of resources to the Garda are needed to ensure a successful clampdown on this scourge.</P>
      <P>The French Government made the sale of tickets above face value a criminal offence. During the World Cup, anyone caught selling tickets was deported and refused re-entry until the competition concluded &ndash; if only that could be done here for All-Ireland finals. The Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers, STAR, in Great Britain guarantees to set out the face value, booking fee and any conditions attached to tickets when it sells them. This is an attempt to protect people from the scourge of touts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> The British Government introduced legislation to outlaw ticket touting at football matches and any other event which might be viewed as a public order risk in 1994. The British Criminal Justice Act makes it an offence to sell a match ticket even at face value. Those found breaking the law can be arrested or have their tickets confiscated. This legislation has reduced dramatically the proliferation of touting at football matches. The current Labour Government plans to extend this to other major events.</P>
    <P>In Ireland touting currently comes under the Casual Trading Act, 1995. In practice this means that when a garda comes across a tout, the individual is usually moved on and nothing more is done. However, it is legal for touts to offer tickets at whatever price they wish. It is impossible for the Garda or any organisation, sporting or otherwise, which is trying to combat the problem to do so effectively without the support of proper legislation.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Bill is to ensure that tickets for such events are available for purchase by genuine fans and are not purchased by third parties trying to exploit the event being held for their personal advantage. A ticket tout is liable on conviction under the Bill to a fine not exceeding £10,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months. Moreover, when a garda has reasonable cause for believing that a person is committing an offence under the Bill, such a person is liable to arrest and the tickets he or she is seeking to sell for a specified event may be confiscated. Consequently, under the legislation it will be illegal for people to tout tickets for sale at excessive prices adjacent to the event's venue and anyone who does so may be arrested.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises that on occasions registered charities and voluntary and community organisations have tickets donated to them for such events or purchase tickets for such events which they sell at a price above face value to raise funds for charitable purposes, community organisations and voluntary activities. The Bill allows such organisations to sell tickets above face value where they have been authorised to do so in writing by the organiser or organisers of the specified event. This copperfastens the protection for charities and helps them to raise money.</P>
    <P>Section 1 covers any sporting, musical or theatrical event at which it is reasonable to anticipate that more than 500 people will attend. Section 2(1) renders it an offence for a person to sell or offer, or expose, for sale a ticket in excess of the price designated on it by the organiser of the event. This provision does not prevent a third party from selling such a ticket at face value. For example, if a person acquires a ticket for an event but is unable to attend, he or she can lawfully sell the ticket for the price marked on it to any third party. Section 2(2) renders it an offence to publish any advertisement for sale of a ticket for a price in excess of that officially designated on it. The newspaper or magazine which publishes such <Col N="564" /> an advertisement will commit an offence under the Bill. Section 2(3) exempts from the Bill's provisions the sale of tickets by registered charities or voluntary or community organisations.</P>
    <P>Section 3 empowers members of the Garda who have reasonable cause for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence to arrest the person without warrant and, for the purpose of making such an arrest, to enter by force and search for such a person in a place where there is reasonable cause to suspect he or she is and to confiscate any tickets in the possession of such persons.</P>
    <P>The practice of touting has become so familiar in Ireland that touts advertise in newspapers and even set up agencies which will guarantee tickets for previously sold out events. The following are examples of this: two Oasis tickets for £250 each or nearest offer, up to 1000 per cent mark up; £100 for a Smashing Pumpkins ticket, a more than 400 per cent mark up and £75 each for two tickets to see The Verve, a more than 300 per cent mark up. I am sure the Minister did not attend these concerts but there are other examples of this. It has become so lucrative that touts have set up their own ticket agencies and openly advertise in newspapers and magazines guaranteeing best seats for a range of concerts and football matches.</P>
    <P>There is a contradiction in Irish and UK legislation. While the resale of a ticket for an English football league game, even at face value, is illegal, touts can resell the same tickets in Ireland at any price. Irish supporters of Manchester United are scalped whereas their counterparts in England are protected; so much for the Common Market. It also gives a bad impression to those who visit Ireland for a concert or sporting event. Next Saturday's rugby international between Ireland and England is a prime example and I am sure the Minister is well aware that this creates a bad impression. France and the UK have legislation in place to try to combat the problem, yet we do not.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Members can recall the clamour for tickets for last year's All-Ireland football final. The touts had a field day and both Galway and Kildare supporters were fleeced. Outside Croke Park and in Dublin city touts were demanding up to £200 each for tickets with a face value of £12, for the Hill 16 and Canal End terraces and Cusack and Hogan stand seats were selling for £300 and £400. Touts were everywhere in the city centre buying and selling tickets. The footpath in front of the Gresham Hotel on O'Connell Street looked like a fair day scene or a mart, as deals were discussed and tickets sold. There is probably more activity in Dublin city centre on All-Ireland final days than there is in many marts at present.</P>
    <P>There are also more recent examples. Adverts placed in <i>The Irish Times</i> in the past week indicate that fans will pay up to £600 for a stand ticket to watch Ireland's Five Nations tie against England. Stand tickets for the pivotal Triple <Col N="565" /> Crown match between Ireland and England at Lansdowne Road next Saturday are fetching up to £1,200 a pair on the black market. While the IRFU is trying to combat this by having each ticket individually numbered so that they are traceable, it acknowledges that it allocates tickets in good faith and that it is somewhat tied if tickets change hands between two mutually agreeable parties.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been the spectacle of IRFU affiliated clubs selling their allocation <i>en masse</i> to provide funds. That raises another factor in the issue of funding. I hope the Minister ensures there is not a repeat of what we witnessed over the past week where clubs have had to sell tickets, thus supplying the touting market, because they cannot fund their activities. Many of them are in debt. While many of the clubs see it as an asset, if this legislation is enacted it will make it illegal.</P>
    <P>Touting is now becoming acceptable and many people say &ldquo;so what&rdquo;. However, if we cast our minds back to the Ireland-England soccer game in Lansdowne Road a few years ago, a game which was a disaster for the sport, what would have been the result of the riot had the supporters not been segregated? If the current situation, where Irish tickets are being sold in England for the rugby game, had prevailed on that occasion, we might have been talking of numbers of deaths akin to the Heysel disaster rather than the lucky escape that it was. It was fortunate that was the situation. Touting could have changed that by placing tickets in the hands of opposing supporters, thus undermining the importance of their segregation.</P>
    <P>There is also the situation where touts buy tickets leading to a shortage for genuine fans. This leaves fans having to queue overnight to try to buy tickets at face value. This queuing nearly led to a tragedy during the sale of tickets for the Oasis concerts at HMV Grafton Street in November 1997. Gardaí and additional security staff had to be called in to control the crowd. Yet when these fans went to The Point to see the band, they were met by touts with plenty of tickets.</P>
    <P>One event last February typifies touting. On that occasion touts sank to a new low by cashing in on the Childline charity concert by Boyzone in Dublin. Children are the most vulnerable people in society, and charity workers who give of their time to help them deserve our support and protection. However, the touts just viewed this as another opportunity to make a killing at the expense of others. How could anyone defend such greed?</P>
    <P>Each year many thousands of sport and concert fans are disappointed when they are unable to obtain tickets for events. Yet when they arrive at the venue ticketless, they are confronted by ticket touts who have large numbers of tickets for sale at hugely inflated prices. Ticket touts can be found at almost every popular entertainment event. While they are more visible at bigger events such as All-Ireland finals, international <Col N="566" /> matches and live concerts, they are even found at weekly events like &ldquo;Midnight at the Olympia&rdquo;, smaller shows and other venues such as Whelans. These black marketeers line their pockets at the expense of young music fans and football supporters. Their sole purpose in life is to exploit others to the detriment of sport and entertainment. This is an issue of unadulterated greed and nothing else.</P>
    <P>As well as enriching themselves at the expense of others, access to many events is denied to the less well off in society who are unable to afford the extortionate prices paid for tickets. This is racketeering and the Criminal Assets Bureau should clamp down on these leeches in our society. However, unless the practice is made illegal, it is very difficult for the CAB to investigate these people. Our sport, music and culture must be put before profiteering and greed. Otherwise, we run the risk of letting our unique culture be destroyed by touts. Is this patriotic? We need a new form of patriotism which stands up for the minority rather than the big business of the touting fraternity. Strong measures are needed against touting because it puts tickets out of the reach of the average fan. Touting flourishes within the criminal fraternity and that is clear. Many touts' sole income comes from touting.</P>
    <P>I was interviewed on a local Dublin radio station and a tout came on the programme. He was blatant in saying that he claimed social welfare benefits and made money from touting. It was his sole income. He was about to go for a three week skiing holiday and was employing someone to go touting for him during the All-Ireland final. I thought that was the big event last year, but obviously it was not when this man could afford to take three weeks off during September and during the All-Ireland final season to go on holiday. He lived in an affluent area of Dublin and was not shy about saying it. In fact, he was quite open about it. This is what I am trying to address. Fans can also lose money by purchasing forged tickets and there are many incidents of this. Touting can also threaten segregation arrangements at high risk events such as international soccer games.</P>
    <P>Despite this, the Government has failed to legislate for this issue and has no plans to do so. In a Dáil reply last June the Tánaiste stated:</P>
    <P>There is no basis in consumer law for prohibiting the sale of tickets above their face value and, accordingly, no regulations or procedures exist for this purpose. I have no plans to introduce such regulations or procedures.</P>
    <P>However, the Tánaiste is not the only one who is failing to act. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation pledged in November 1997 to examine demands for strict regulations governing the sale of concert tickets. That was in relation to the riots in Grafton Street among those waiting to buy tickets for the Oasis concerts, and also in relation to the sale of tickets for the third concert by credit card only, which discriminated against <Col N="567" /> many young people and left the situation open for touts to exploit. The Minister gave a commitment to examine that, yet we still have not heard anything about it. Has he examined the matter? What is the situation? I hope the Minister addresses that point in his reply.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been considering the licensing of outdoor concerts for the past 18 months. While many members of the Government are quick to give positive comments to the media, their inaction blatantly shows the priority they afford the issue. Their blind eye approach is allowing this parasitic practice to escalate to the extent that young people are resigned to paying over the odds for entry into major events.</P>
      <P>Irish society should be a place where fair play for all is the Government's motto. Strong legislative measures are needed to tackle touting, to reintroduce the concept of fair play and place tickets within the reach of the average fan. This shady trading is seriously damaging the excellent reputation of many sports. The Minister is working trojanly to prevent this. He should introduce legislation to ensure proper regulation.</P>
      <P>Commercialisation is the key word in the development of sport. While allowing the touts to flourish, pay-per-view television and corporate boxes will force the real punter out of the stands. Genuine music and sports fans should have the best possible opportunity to buy tickets for major events at a reasonable price. The scourge of ticket touts and the exploitation of young sports and concert enthusiasts in particular must be stamped out.</P>
      <P>This Bill would combat the problem which affects more than 30 major sports and musical events each year. Tickets can be difficult to obtain because demand often exceeds supply. Touts increase demand by buying up tickets and only those who can afford to buy at the higher price can avail of them. Legislation should be based not on individualism but on the shared values of a modern country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have received the support of the major sporting organisations and concert promoters, including the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Irish Rugby Football Union, the Football Association of Ireland, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Union of Students in Ireland, MCD concert promoters and the Ticket Master agency. We have also received the support of hundreds of supporters throughout the country who meet the touts each time they go to a major concert or match in Dublin. One such person is Ralph, an elderly man from Killarney, County Kerry &ndash; Deputy Deenihan's home county &ndash; who has been going to Lansdowne Road for the past 53 years. He has been a steward in the ground for <Col N="568" /> 40 years. He still does not have a ticket for the match on Saturday. Irish clubs are selling tickets to persons in England. One can be certain that the touts will be there bright and early on Saturday morning waiting to make a killing like vultures. Is this morally right? </P>
    <P>Growing up I had the great pleasure of going to Croke Park on a number of occasions with my father. Sadly, the results were disappointing. Roscommon did not win too often, unlike Donegal.</P>

      <P>It is the wish of many young people to go to Croke Park. Do we want to deny future generations this dream? For far too long politicians have failed to tackle this thorny issue. The Fine Gael Party is committed to stamping out the exploitation of genuine music fans and football supporters.</P>
      <P>My colleagues on the Government benches should acknowledge the need for this legislation and support it. Should they fail to do so they will have to explain to parents and football supporters why the touts are forcing them away from supporting their county teams in Croke Park or the Irish rugby and soccer teams in Lansdowne Road. Will they be prepared to tell the truth, that they had the opportunity to stop this practice but voted against the Bill because of political point scoring? Are they prepared to ensure genuine music and sports fans have the best possible opportunity to buy tickets for major events at a reasonable price? Do we wish to continue to be the victims of ticket touts or the ones who finally put them out of business? Do we want the attendance at football matches and concerts confined to those who can afford to pay the touts? Do we want to bring this rip-off to an end? </P>
      <P>These are the questions which have to be answered. It is crucially important that we combat this scourge which has continued for far too long. Other countries have tried to combat it, sometimes successfully, sometimes not, but at least they have made an effort. If given a helping hand, sporting organisations would have an opportunity to initiate prosecutions against those who tout tickets, but they have been banging their heads off a brick wall. They need legislative support. Gardaí are frustrated when they see touts outside grounds. There is a gaping hole, although I accept the Minister is committed to regulating the sale of tickets. If the touts were eliminated, there would be more tickets available for those who want to see Donegal or Roscommon play in an All-Ireland final&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Naughten on his initiative. He should be lauded by all Members. It is heartening to see a young Deputy bring forward legislation within two years. Deputy Naughten has a great future in politics. He saw a gap and capitalised on it. He has introduced good legislation. Although I am not a legal person, I see nothing wrong with it. I doubt if it has constitutional flaws as it is being co-sponsored by Deputy Shatter. There is no reason the Government should not accept it. It makes common sense. There is nothing extraordinary or far-fetched about it. It is practical legislation which would combat the problem.</P>
      <P>The House should have acted on the problem before now. It has been brought to its attention on numerous occasions. It arises each time there is a concert or match involving the Irish soccer and rugby teams or at All-Ireland finals. It is a source of concern for a week or two and then forgotten about. As a result of Deputy Naughten's initiative, the Government is being forced to act.</P>
      <P>I am more familiar with what happens at All-Ireland hurling and football finals when supporters are ripped off. Before the last All-Ireland football final I saw a Kildare emigrant pay £500 for a Hogan Stand ticket. That is immoral. He was looking forward so much to seeing Kildare on the field in an All-Ireland final that he would have given anything to see the match, but that should not have happened. Over the years I have seen several Kerry immigrants, who had been working on building sites in England and who would not be wealthy by any means, forced to fork out large sums of money for a ticket. They did not want to have come all the way from London and be forced to watch the game in a pub. These are the people of whom we should think. This injustice is caused by the lack of regulation of ticket touting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that we should look at the actions of the organisations and associations involved. The GAA, the IRFU and the FAI should look at their methods of ticket distribution. I am reasonably familiar with the GAA's system of ticket distribution. Irrespective of who is involved in an All-Ireland final, clubs throughout the country are allocated tickets. If the county or province is not involved, in normal circumstances members from those clubs may not be interested in travelling to Dublin. Those tickets become free and it is inevitable that they end up in the hands of a ticket tout. There should be a better method for recalling unused tickets. In fact, they should not be sent out in the first <Col N="570" /> instance. In this age of technology, surely that is possible.</P>
    <P>People come to matches with tickets to distribute to friends or they bring unused tickets from clubs, and they are left stuck with tickets in front of the barriers. Rather than keeping them in their pockets, they give them to touts at face value. In fact, at times they even give them away for nothing. Normally the GAA has a ticket depot in front of the Hogan Stand, but that is no good for the person who is stuck outside the barrier and cannot get in to buy those tickets. The GAA officials should be out in front collecting the tickets at well signposted points of sale and redistributing them to genuine GAA supporters. The ticket touts are well known to the Garda Síochána and GAA officials. It is easy to identify a ticket tout from a genuine supporter. There is no reason the IRFU and the FAI should not be able to do something similar.</P>
    <P>There is no reason the Minister cannot accept this simple piece of legislation which would have the desired objective and would be effective. It is what all the organisations are looking for. Deputy Naughten conducted a good trawl of all of the organisations and he has massive support for this Bill. I appeal to the Minister, who is a pragmatic and practical individual, to carefully consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Naughten on this the first of many Bills to be introduced by him. It is innovative and thoughtful, as Deputy Deenihan correctly stated. He certainly has captured the market because ticket touting is big business and it is operating in the black economy. As a business person, I know about the regulations and consumer rights involved in the selling of a simple product in a hardware store or supermarket. The law in this area is outdated and there are major concerns.</P>
      <P>Deputy Naughten stated that people are forced to pay £500 for an All-Ireland final ticket at a time when they are completely vulnerable. The seller knows the client has money in his or her back pocket and is willing to pay. I appeal to the Minister to support Deputy Naughten's Bill because the law needs to be changed rapidly.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to render it a criminal offence to advertise for sale or sell a ticket for a major musical, sporting or theatrical event at a price in excess of the price designated on the ticket. The objective of the Bill is to ensure as far as possible that tickets for such events are available for purchase by genuine fans and are not purchased by third parties exploiting the event for their personal advantage. The introduction to the Bill says it all. As Deputy Naughten correctly stated, the fact that a person availing of social welfare can go on a three week skiing holiday begs a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan advocated a new system for selling tickets. Controls on the sale of tickets needs to be looked at. The time has come to stop the touts and the Minister is well aware of the difficulties involved. There are people operating <Col N="571" /> in the black economy who buy a ticket for £20 and put the £100 they receive from its sale in their back pockets. Legislation is necessary. The Minister, who understands the difficulties, is in a position to do something about it.</P>
    <P>There is a huge body of law to protect the consumer and there are crowd control regulations. All the sporting organisations are working to ensure value for money for the genuine fan. Ireland has a history of ticket touting but there is no law against it. The problem has never been properly addressed by the authorities. As we approach the millennium, something must be done.</P>
    <P>Some punishment has been imposed on touts but it has not stopped them operating because it is only a minor offence. The action of the GAA, for instance, in asking people to report if they bought a ticket from a tout quoting the ticket number, is ineffective. Such cases will never be processed through the courts.</P>
    <P>The GAA, the FAI and the Garda do not have the powers. This weekend some people in Dublin will make a killing on tickets for the match at Lansdowne Road. People will come from abroad for the occasion and the touts know they are vulnerable and have the cash to buy tickets from them. Deputy Naughten's well thought out Bill is long overdue. Minister McDaid has the power to accept this Bill and put in place its provisions.</P>
    <P>Pay to view television is turning people away from attending such events. Some say they will not go to major events because they cannot buy a ticket. As Deputy Deenihan stated, there should be a new system for selling tickets throughout the country because it is controlled by too few people. People should have an opportunity to buy tickets for major concerts, such as the Oasis concert, the theatre, etc.</P>
    <P>What is the cost of touting to the Exchequer? All Departments impose controls to eliminate the black economy but there are people on welfare exploiting the system with total disregard for the law. My greatest concern relates to pay to view television. With the power of multi-channel television and Sky Television, not only will the consumer be unable to buy a ticket for an event but they will be unable to watch it on television. Where can the genuine fan go?</P>
    <P>The Minister must give people the opportunity to attend the All-Ireland final. I guarantee that the touts will not operate at a heritage weekend because there will be no demand for tickets. They are shrewd operators. They go to the events where there is maximum return for the least effort.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Naughten on bringing forward this Bill and appeal to the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Hanafin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation <Col N="572" /> I welcome, in principle, the thrust of the Bill. However, there are some aspects of the Bill which are inadequate and which, at the very least, require further consideration, both from a legal and practical perspective.</P>
    <P>Ticket touting is carried on openly in our streets prior to major public events. Exorbitant prices are extracted while genuine fans cannot get access to the sporting and cultural events they have voluntarily supported and followed all their lives. I am prepared, therefore, to support the Bill's advancement to Committee Stage on the understanding that certain issues can be satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>In accepting the Bill I must explain that ticket touting is only one of my concerns. My other concern is politics. Week after week in this House issues are discussed in an adversarial and politically unproductive manner. At times in recent months the atmosphere in Dáil Éireann has resembled that of a Punch and Judy show. As the heat was turned up enlightenment receded and at times all but disappeared.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann is full of honourable people who came into politics to contribute ideas and to contribute to their communities. We are in politics to better the day to day lives of the people we represent. Ticket touting is only one example of the way many ordinary people do not get a fair crack of the whip. Politicians of every party genuinely care about the ordinary person being put down. Most of us came into politics to do something constructive about issues of fair play and decency.</P>
    <P>Somewhere along the line politics has lost its way. We in this House frequently are not seen as being on the side of the ordinary person. Politicians are increasingly perceived as being a self-serving elite. The reasons for this are threefold. First, the recent revelations about payments to politicians have genuinely disturbed many people. The second and third reasons are an increasingly shrill and sensationalist style of politics being reported by an increasingly soundbite orientated media.</P>
    <P>In accepting the Bill I want to demonstrate that politicians of all sides are prepared to work together to tackle the issues facing people in their day to day lives. I particularly want to send a message to young people, who are especially affected by ticket touts, that politics carried on in this manner can make a positive difference to them.</P>
    <P>I warmly compliment Deputy Naughten on his initiative in bringing forward the Bill. As a Government Minister I am happy to accept the principle of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Government office does not confer a monopoly of wisdom on its holder. I hope that a characteristic of my time in office will be an openness to ideas as well as a preparedness to work with people of good intentions from every background. That is what the people who sent us here expect from us. Let this debate tonight be an example of the Dáil serving the people and <Col N="573" /> responding constructively to real issues. My own party, Fianna Fáil, fought the last election on the promise of putting people before politics. In accepting the principle of the Bill tonight, the Government is putting people before politics.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the manner in which politics has been conducted over the past months against a background of unprecedented alienation. Instead of taking stock and reflecting on the administration of our affairs, business has been conducted in an increasingly adversarial manner. Issues on which common cause should have been prevailed have been turned into political footballs. This is not what we came into politics to do and it is not how I intend to conduct my business.</P>
    <P>The relative ease with which ticket touts seem to be able to get their hands on tickets for events is one issue which rears its head regularly throughout the year. Whether it is in the context of tickets for pop concerts, theatrical or sporting events, all of us at one time or another, when we have been unable to secure a ticket for a popular event, are irritated when we are offered a ticket for the event at prices in excess of the face value.</P>
    <P>The distribution process for tickets varies from event to event. For example, in sporting events like the All-Ireland finals, soccer and rugby internationals or other major sporting events, the tickets are generally allocated through the club structure, yet at every event ticket touts operate a very lucrative business. One would imagine that all genuine followers of sport would be interested in ensuring that their fellow sports enthusiast is afforded an opportunity of attending a major sporting event without having to pay exorbitant prices for admission tickets.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, whether it is by accident or design, many tickets issued to individual units of the sporting organisations fall into the hands of ticket touts. I realise this is an issue which the major sporting organisations feel strongly about and they have taken steps to eliminate the potential for the touting of  tickets. However, ticket touts continue to do business at major sporting events. It behoves each sporting organisation to review its ticketing policy on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>It is important that the interests of the ordinary sportsperson be represented and borne in mind. The genuine sports fan is entitled to expect a fair and reasonable opportunity of obtaining a ticket and enjoying the game in safety and comfort.</P>
    <P>Top competitive sport and major competitions can only exist with the support of the public and those people who support, through good times and bad, their club, county, province or country. The typical sports fan who has to struggle to get tickets &ndash; in some cases these tickets are already expensive &ndash; is a person who has been or still is involved in sport, often at grass roots level. These people have made an enormous contribution to the development of sport, enriching the quality of community life and providing positive experiences for young people and players through the years. It is crucial that sports organisations and <Col N="574" /> event organisers bear in mind that the success and development of sport depends on the ordinary person for its support and sustenance.</P>
    <P>The ever-increasing emphasis on the commercialisation of sport, and the growing professionalism on and off the pitch, should not be allowed to prevent the ordinary person &ndash; either player or spectator &ndash; from having a real and positive involvement in all aspects of sport. It will be a sad day for sport if the local volunteer, player and supporter involved in the everyday life of sport is cut off and excluded.</P>
    <P>The distribution and availability of match tickets has been a bone of contention as far back as any of us can remember. It seems to have become an increasingly high profile problem in recent years. This is perhaps a result of the increasing popularity of sport, the improving standard of our players nationally and internationally and the excellent work being done by sports organisations.</P>
    <P>As long as demand exceeds supply there will always be disappointed people. However, this does not remove the responsibility from the organisations and the promoters to continually check, streamline and improve the distribution system to ensure the genuine fan is treated fairly, openly and with proper consideration. It is essential that systems and safeguards are put in place that will inhibit and, hopefully, prevent the ticket tout from gaining the advantage.</P>
    <P>There is something mean and despicable about these touts, these cheats, who cynically, year after year and event after event, continue to abuse all the tenets of fair play to make money by depriving ordinary, decent people of the opportunity to enjoy their sport.</P>
    <P>There is another, perhaps more alarming aspect to the involvement of ticket touts, particularly at some international matches. Event organisers and stadium managers have a serious responsibility to help ensure that spectators can attend matches in safety and in comfort and that measures are put in place to avoid conflict and violence among spectators. A key, crucial element in this is the segregation of fans, as Deputy Naughten has mentioned, and the effective distribution of tickets to ensure this segregation. The unscrupulous activities of ticket touts can throw all of these plans into disarray and undermine the carefully planned segregation of rival supporters. Sports organisations, ground management and event promoters should have proper ticket circulation arrangements in place to minimise the possibility of tickets falling into the hands of ticket touts.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for sport I have obviously concentrated on issues affecting sport. Equally, this will apply to musical, theatrical and other cultural events. The Government is committed to the promotion and development of sport in all its aspects and at all levels. I am concerned also that everyone should have a reasonable opportunity to take part in sport and to <Col N="575" /> enjoy sport as a fan and as a supporter. The involvement of ticket touts sours and spoils the enjoyment and accessibility of our great sporting events. It is essential that every effort is made to remove, or at least curtail, these ticket cheats while not, in turn, destroying the atmosphere and excitement of these wonderful occasions.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some aspects of the Bill which I consider require further and serious consideration. Section 3 states:</P>
    <P>If a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable cause for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence under section 2(1), that member may&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)arrest without warrant the person who has so behaved and</P>
    <P>(b)for the purpose of making such arrest, enter, if need be by force, and search any place where the member with reasonable cause suspects such person to be and</P>
    <P>(c)confiscate any ticket for a specified event in the possession of the person so arrested or found in any place in which the person is arrested.</P>
    <P>A number of issues come to mind in connection with this section. The strategic management initiative on the Garda Síochána of June 1997 recommended that the gardaí should concentrate their energies on criminal offences and traffic and should not be sidetracked into what could be termed administrative issues. There is no doubt that the Bill, as currently drafted, will divert a disproportionate amount of Garda resources to this area. We should ask ourselves if the policing of ticket touts would be a legitimate and beneficial investment of its resources by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill as currently drafted gives power to a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest a person where that member has reasonable cause for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence. Could we have a situation where, for example, a person with five tickets for his friend or who is seen from a distance by a member of the Garda Síochána to be exchanging tickets for money, is arrested on suspicion of ticket touting? These are genuine issues which must be resolved. Clearly this could raise civil liberties issues and, once again, these need careful consideration and management.</P>
    <P>Although it is acknowledged that some ticket touting could be prevented by a stronger physical Garda presence outside sports grounds or concert venues, heavy handed Garda actions such as moves to arrest touts or persons suspected of ticket touting may have a negative effect on what for many should be an enjoyable event.</P>
    <P>The role being proposed for the gardaí could have the effect of reducing the responsibility which currently exists for the organisers of events for the policing of the distribution of tickets. This is another matter which would have to be <Col N="576" /> seriously considered. If the Government were to take a proactive role in the policing of the distribution of tickets as envisaged in the Bill, it is likely that the event organisers who benefit financially from these events might be tempted to reduce their vigilance in the distribution of tickets.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the principle of regulating the sale of tickets, the Government would have serious reservations about the aspects of the Bill which I have just mentioned. For example, if a person were seen passing tickets to friends, how could a garda deal with that? Section 2(1) provides that it is an offence for an unauthorised person to sell or offer or expose for sale in any place, a ticket for a specified event for a price in excess of the price officially designated on the ticket by the organiser or organisers of the event. These issues must be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>Will this Bill make the sale of tickets for corporate entertainment a criminal offence? I am aware from newspaper reports that occasionally, financially hard pressed clubs have sold their ticket allocation for rugby internationals and so on, for prices considerably above their face value. Is this what Deputy Naughten proposes? What is the position of legitimate travel agents who obtain tickets for shows in London or sporting events abroad and want to make their usual mark up? Will this be illegal? What about the ordinary GAA supporter who is desperate to get to an All-Ireland final? If he or she offers above the odds for a ticket will that constitute a criminal offence? </P>
    <P>Who is a ticket tout? The people we see on the street get their tickets from somewhere. There is no point in targeting the sellers if we are not prepared to pursue the master minds behind them. While I agree with the Bill in principle we must take all these matters into consideration. This Bill would transfer the burden of regulating the sale of tickets away from the organiser who is gaining a profit onto the State. However, these issues can be discussed at a later stage.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the commencement of my address I support the thrust of this Bill. I compliment Deputy Naughten on bringing it forward but I have some concerns which I hope can be satisfactorily resolved as the Bill progresses through the House. However, let the message go out from this House and let us together put the ticket touts out of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Tréaslaím leis an Teachta Naughten. I congratulate Deputy Naughten for bringing forward this Bill and I commend the Minister for accepting the principle. It is a major achievement for a new Deputy, like myself, to have a Private Members' Bill accepted. I commend Deputy Naughten on his work in putting the Bill together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all familiar with the dealings of touts at cultural and sporting events. It must be said that we can walk past them. We do not have to buy from them. I recall attending &ndash; or rather not <Col N="577" /> attending &ndash; a concert with three friends. We went hoping to get tickets and when we failed to do so and refused to pay ticket touts the price they demanded, we went home and played the CD of the artist and imagined we were at the concert.</P>
    <P>It is not always possible to avoid paying above the face value of a ticket when one deals with the real touts. The real touts are not referred to in the Bill although we may refer to them on Committee Stage. They are the official ticket selling companies who charge a compulsory booking fee on every ticket. An REM concert is scheduled for 16 July. The advertisements say &ldquo;tickets from £25&rdquo; but quite clearly state in brackets, &ldquo;£2.50 booking fee&rdquo;. The ticket costs £27.50, not £25. If one rings up to book a ticket, that is the price quoted. If one decides to call to the agent to buy a ticket rather than book it by credit card, one would have to pay &ndash; like the 40,000 teenagers who want to book their tickets and who do not have credit cards &ndash; a £2.50 booking fee. One is compelled to pay more than the face value of the ticket when purchasing it from official touts.</P>
    <P>If I were to book four tickets, I would have to pay a £2.50 booking fee per ticket. If three friends and I were to go to see REM on 16 July, the tickets, which should cost £100, would cost £110. That is blatant exploitation of young people and is totally unjustifiable. Members referred to people who sell tickets for more than their face value outside venues, but the payment of a booking charge is an example of touting in its extreme.</P>
    <P>If I decided to buy a ticket for the Corrs concert at the Point Depot on 17 July from an agent other than Ticketmaster, I would discover that Ticketmaster is the sole agent for the Point Depot and other venues in this city. Therefore, one has to pay a £2.50 booking fee for tickets for those venues.</P>
    <P>While the charging of a booking fee may be justified on the basis that it ensures a customer has a seat or standing space at a concert, I discovered that no exchange or refund is allowed in respect of such tickets. The is nothing in the payment of a booking fee for the customer. Like the tout who walks away when a customer pays more than the face value for a ticket, the booking agent, Ticketmaster, has no further responsibility for customers, despite their having paid an extra £2.50 per ticket.</P>
    <P>I thought that the profits from the sale of tickets might come back to this country and Ticketmaster might employ Irish people, but on telephoning its freefone number I discovered it is based in London, has English employees and its profits remain in England. Its profits do not go to the performer, the promoter, the venue and certainly not to the supporter. That agent is a real tout.</P>
    <P>The reason the Ticketmaster agent gave for charging a booking fee is that it provides a 24-hour booking line. Many people here could organise such a hotline, if they were to charge a <Col N="578" /> booking fee of £2.50 per ticket on anything from 6,000 to 40,000 tickets per concert. Seldom a week passes that there is not at least one concert on here. That would ensure that some of the profits from the sale of such tickets would remain here.</P>
    <P>Ticketmaster does not sell tickets at their face value and it does not offer customers a choice. That practice is even more exploitative and abusive than the activity of the man who stands outside an event trying to sell customers tickets at their face value. Customers do not have to buy tickets from him, but if they want to buy a legitimate ticket for an event they must pay a booking charge.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Naughten for introducing legislation to deal with these touts. While one can walk past them, there is an element of greed involved in touting which takes from legitimate charities and functions. I was particularly appalled to see touts outside a recent Childline concert &ndash; the proceeds of which go towards helping children in need who may be at risk &ndash; pocketing money from the sale of those tickets. Greed is at the heart of touting, but one would imagine they would have a heart.</P>
    <P>Another type of touting, with which the Minister, Deputy de Valera, may deal, is the practice whereby customers must pay over the odds to watch televised sporting events. Certain TV companies purchase the rights to televise all the major matches and customers must purchase the right to see those matches. Customers should be able to view events for a basic charge.</P>
    <P>Our concerts and sporting and cultural events are often marred by the touts outside those events. The Minister referred to the role of the Garda in this regard. I once found it of benefit to know a garda who I brought back to a tout selling tickets outside a venue. The tout had to insist he was selling a ticket at face value otherwise he would have been caught out. There can be advantages in that regard, but that is the thin end of the wedge.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for allowing this Bill to go to Committee Stage. I look forward to the changes that will be made to it. Some way should be found to avoid the payment of booking fees on tickets, which is an unjustifiable form of exploitation. There are different types of touts, but booking agents are the worst because customers cannot avoid them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Naughten on introducing this Bill, which is supported by the Labour Party. I compliment the Minister on accepting the Bill <Col N="579" /> and I look forward to dealing with it when it comes before the relevant committee.</P>
    <P>Ticket touts have been a feature of sporting events and pop concerts for many years. It would be a mistake to think such touts are small time casual traders seeking to make a few quid at each event. More onus should be put on sporting bodies to keep a record of the allocation of tickets. Tickets posted to me last year for a sporting event went astray. Another person's tickets also went astray in the post. The sporting body concerned did not keep a record of the numbers of those tickets which meant that whoever got them could use them. I could not identify the tickets or the seats allocated.  The introduction of legislation to deal with touting is welcome, but we should not remove the onus from sporting organisations or the promoters of concerts or theatrical events to ensure they put their houses in order. Methods can be found through the use of modern technology to ensure that the numbers of tickets issued to various people are recorded. If the people who pass on tickets to touts are identified, they, as well as touts, should be dealt with under this legislation. There is, from what I can glean, a sophisticated ticket touting network operating across the country. These people seem to be able to access blocks of tickets for key sporting and cultural events and then sell them on at exorbitant prices to spectators who cannot access tickets at the point of sale.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that there is too much money in sport at present. This is bad in the short to medium term, but it could also be very damaging in the long term. The strength of the popular field games here has always been that admission to matches has been within the relatively comfortable reach of everybody. There are supporters' clubs in Ireland for many of the British premier division football teams. The tickets for those games are exorbitantly priced. The controlling commercial interests will stay as long as there is money in it, but once that money dries up they will go. This will have a very detrimental effect on sport.</P>
    <P>Football clubs also engage in merchandising, which involves the selling of goods far above their value because they carry the club's logo. Research was carried out on bullying among school children in a particular area in Dublin. The boys who were bullied felt the worst kind of bullying was when they were referred to as &ldquo;Vinnies&rdquo;. Effectively, &ldquo;Vinnies&rdquo; were people who were not wearing designer runners, designer track suits and so on. It seemed those children would prefer to be physically beaten than mocked in this particular way. There is a social aspect to this merchandising. Many parents on limited incomes which do not stretch very far are under pressure to ensure their children feel as good as everyone else's child by having merchandised goods from the various football clubs. However, they become part of an exercise in which everything is overpriced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> It may appear to be a small issue but I would like an onus to be put on the relevant Department to make the terms of this Bill clearly known to all publications &ndash; and we have an increasing print media &ndash; so that they will not carry classified advertisements for overpriced tickets.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hanafin that booking and other extra charges should be outlawed and that tickets should have a basic price. One would wonder if the approach to some of these concerts is to pick up the money and run, with no particular responsibilities. These events must be closely monitored, not just in terms of ticket touting but also in terms of the responsibility which rests with organisers to ensure large numbers of tickets do not fall into the wrong hands, resulting in people being exploited.</P>
    <P>I marvel at the inconvenience and discomfort that young people will suffer to go to concerts. It may stretch their income greatly to go to these concerts and they may have to save for a period. If the selling of tickets way above their marked price is allowed to continue, young people, who do not have that kind of money, will be excluded.</P>
    <P>The punishments for such offences under this Bill are sensible. The £1,000 maximum fine and the term of imprisonment not exceeding six months are sensible, while strict and stiff enough to get the message across to the ticket touts that the game is not worth a candle.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill will not completely prevent ticket touting because, as is the case with every prohibition that is brought in, those who are breaking the law become more sophisticated and find other ways to sell their wares. It will be an ongoing problem, but it is welcome that all sides of the House are accepting this Bill which will do a very great service to sport, theatres and concerts and, more important, will remove an underhanded, sneaky and exploitative practice that has been going on for far too long and has reached a level of sophistication which will otherwise continue to grow.</P>
    <P>It is also welcome that the Bill contains provisions whereby registered charities can raffle or auction tickets. I won my two tickets for the All-Ireland semi-final between Waterford and Kilkenny this year in a draw &ndash; I did not have to bid for them at an auction but got them for nothing, apart from the price of the raffle ticket. I would like to see that practice continue. However, to be serious about it, it is important that no restrictions are placed on bona fide charities which seek to raise money to serve the needs in our society.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Naughten and the Minister on this legislation. The Labour Party will examine the Bill between now and Committee Stage, as will the Government and Fine Gael. I am sure the Bill can be improved, in the same spirit as has been shown in the House tonight, with a view to attaining the objectives that are important for all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, <Col N="581" /> I congratulate the movers of the Bill, Deputies Shatter and Naughten. I also congratulate the Minister for accepting the Bill and enabling us to move towards having it enacted.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is in the Chamber. A couple of weeks ago, on the day before the closure of the capital sports grants, I had an opportunity to raise some of the concerns in regard to those grants with the Minister's colleague, which were probably transmitted to him. The Minister needs great support from the Government, given the small fund of £10 million he received this year to cater for 42 constituencies, almost four million people and the huge number of voluntary sports organisations, which are doing incredible work promoting leisure activities for all age groups. This Bill serves to remind us that one of the particular problems in regard to sport is that much of the money generated does not go to those who need it most. Where rugby, association or Gaelic football is concerned, it seems to be a huge struggle to get the money to the mentors and players on the ground who work week in and week out for their communities. I hope the Minister will ask the Government to reconsider the funding allocation he has received to carry out crucial work. I believe the Minister should have at least five times the money he has &ndash; perhaps in the region of £50 million.</P>
      <P>I am very happy to support this Bill. Ticket touts have been a regular feature at sporting events and pop concerts for too long. I support the Dubs but we have not been in a situation recently where there was a massive demand for tickets. Like the Taoiseach, I am a Manchester United supporter. In recent years, I have witnessed very sophisticated touting systems in operation at every home game at which there is usually a capacity crowd. We have witnessed the same thing here at provincial finals and other big matches, for example, the famous Meath-Dublin matches some years ago, All-Ireland finals, semi-finals, rugby internationals and some soccer internationals. This Bill will attack the sophisticated ticket touting network operating throughout the country &ndash; the people who access blocks of tickets to key sporting and cultural events and then sell them on at exorbitant prices to spectators.</P>
      <P>I encountered some small street traders in my own local authority this morning who were seeking licences to trade on St. Patrick's Day. The city charges such traders £10 per day to trade in certain locations. Every city and town attempts to regulate street traders in an effort to protect rate-paying ones. It is irritating that no controls whatsoever have been implemented in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an insidious trend that companies involved in hospitality and public relations purchase large numbers of tickets and, to some extent, create a different kind of market for them. We have seen that in high profile concerts, such as the Oasis performance. There is another phenomenon of tickets going astray in various organisations which the Bill may not be able to address directly. Recently, one particular associ<Col N="582" /> ation expressed concern about tickets which had apparently been distributed through clubs but which actually ended up on the streets. The Garda and the courts also have responsibilities in this area, as have major associations and promoters of cultural and musical events who must ensure they do not contribute to the creation of a false market in which speculators thrive.</P>
    <P>If we allow this kind of behaviour to go unchecked, more and more events may fall prey to touts whose operations will become even more sophisticated. We have witnessed the degree to which they have penetrated the market in recent years for key events such as the World Cup. It is the ordinary sports or music fan who loses out and ends up either paying through the nose for the privilege of attending the event or misses it altogether.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 3 which deals with Garda powers but it requires further consideration on Committee Stage. If one considers sophisticated touting operations, it will often be the case that an individual tout may only have one ticket in his possession whereas others may have mobile phones and be part of an operation which employs ten or 12 people. Section 3 as it stands would place a tremendous onus on gardaí in the run-up to a major event to ensure they did not home in on someone who was merely trying to transfer a ticket. A sophisticated operation would be required to detect that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's other measures and the fact that an exception has been made for charities and voluntary groups. We have all had the pleasure of contributing to voluntary activity in which a set of tickets for a big event is often the major prize. In regard to advertising, I would have some concerns about people seeking to dispose of tickets. It is important to ensure we do not seek to impose restrictions on local papers and the kind of urban free sheets on which Deputies rely heavily to inform their electorate of developments in the Dáil or at county or city council level. We should ensure that our colleagues in the newspaper industry are well informed about precisely what kind of advertisements we are seeking to stamp out.</P>
    <P>I referred at the outset to the funding at the Minister's disposal and the manner in which sport is accessed here and elsewhere. We have seen how Rupert Murdoch's organisation &ndash; Sky Television &ndash; and others have sought to create a vertical organisation between sporting and theatrical events and the entire television network. At the moment, Mr. Murdoch seems to be attempting to buy two of the major football clubs in Europe, namely, Manchester United and Paris-St. Germain. That, allied to his control of the extra-terrestrial television network, will place certain restrictions on the accessibility of sport. I believe that the great sporting events such as All-Ireland finals, rugby internationals and so on should be accessible to everyone. From next year onwards, we will have the Six Nations Cup with perhaps <Col N="583" /> two or three big games taking place in Dublin every year.</P>

A caring Government, especially at a time of additional revenue, should examine and support this area and broaden the carer's allowance. I am sure every Member has the experience of people visiting their clinics saying they are looking after a parent and would like to combine that with going out to work, but that it is impossible to do both. In such circumstances it is very important, in a caring and Christian society, that carers looking after elderly people in their own homes are given every consideration and support in the vital role they play. In many cases if those being cared for had to go to hospital or a home, the State would have to support the staff and the hospital. While I am sure all Ministers are interested in better bookkeeping, that should not be the only reason carers get every consideration and the carer's allowance should be broadened to bring more people into the net.</P>
      <P>When a couple of pension age apply for free telephone rental, they will not qualify unless one of them is incapacitated. The allowance should be given, especially in rural areas, to encourage people to have a telephone, because without doubt people are afraid. I know schemes such as the warning scheme are introduced through neighbourhood watch, but the free telephone rental scheme should be broadened. It is a ready made system and the Department should be seen to play its role in making people a bit more comfortable and secure. From my experience I know people are happier when they have a telephone. The elderly have often said to me that they do not feel as isolated or insecure when they have the phone and I ask the Minister to seriously examine the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past I have asked various Ministers to examine the variables in the non-contributory pension scheme. There are self-employed people who spend all their lives working in their own business and who never ask the State for anything. In many cases they are taxpayers all their lives. When they come to pension age and apply for a non-contributory pension all hell breaks lose. Inspectors arrive <Col N="584" /> and this, that and the other is checked out. Even things that do not exist are checked out. People have said to me that after spending their lives working and never having asked the State for a penny, they are treated with the greatest suspicion when they apply for a pension. This does not show a caring society and is not the way the State should treat its elderly. I ask the Minister to raise the limits on non-contributory pensions. People who worked all their lives and made contributions to the State in many ways should be given some dignity and allowed their due pension. While I know it is popular to say that everybody should be given a pension, I feel there is room to extend the non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the means tests for small farmers applying for assistance. When means are being assessed much of the evaluation on stock, etc., is totally and utterly out of date. Small farmers have to buy fodder for their stock to ensure they remain alive because if they die they are worth nothing. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, knows the price of stock. It is vitally important that those carrying out the assessment are updated on the situation by the local Teagasc office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very good and comprehensive Bill. Representations made over many years about anomalies and proposed reforms have been recognised and taken on board by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in this Bill.</P>
      <P>For years it was generally accepted that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, when he held the portfolio, was an authority on social welfare matters given his humanitarian and caring approach and his grasp of detail about the various social welfare schemes. It now appears, however, that this Minister is an equally effective and dynamic Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and will be remembered for many years to come for the provisions announced in this Bill and the initiatives he brought forward in 1999.</P>
      <P>I support the change in the Department's name to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This name change reflects an expansion of the activities of the Department. It is no longer the Department responsible only for handing out social welfare benefits, rather it is a Department which deals with all aspects of social, community and family life, which is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example of this is the introduction and development of the grant scheme for community development and family support groups. This is money well spent and backs up voluntary community organisations which are under pressure in <Col N="585" /> today's society and allows them to undertake invaluable work for the good of the community, families and society as a whole. It is an example of a little money going a long way. These voluntary and community organisations are doing invaluable work in difficult circumstances. Volunteers are not coming forward as much as they used to. This money allows them to carry out their activities and supports them in their endeavours.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the 1999 budget was one for the elderly. The £6 per week increase in the maximum personal rate has been widely welcomed. The special 50 per cent pension for certain self-employed people who were aged 56 and over in April 1998 and who have at least five years' PRSI contributions since then has also been widely welcomed. There is no doubt there was anger among certain self-employed people in this regard and I am delighted the issue is being addressed.</P>
    <P>The changes in medical card eligibility for people over 70 years have been widely welcomed and are seen as a major innovation. I hope there will be a further relaxation of the eligibility guidelines and that it could be phased in over the next few years to facilitate all people over 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>An issue I would like to highlight is the date of introduction of social welfare increases, to which several other speakers referred. This year the increases will come into play in June. There would be widespread support in the community for bringing this date forward each year &ndash; first to April and then perhaps to January &ndash; so that claimants would know exactly where they stand. The date should not be set by way of arbitrary decision. While I appreciate budgetary considerations are involved, it is the one issue people raise with us on the doorsteps, particularly elderly people who say they are not getting their increases until June or July, by which time their rents and so on have increased. In the interests of efficiency, among other things, we should bring forward this date so that everyone knows where they stand.</P>
    <P>I would also like to raise the increase for a qualified adult dependant. The increase in this budget is £3 for older people. Again, people are annoyed that the adult allowance rate increase is not the same as the personal rate increase. Perhaps this issue could also be addressed in future budgets, as it is raised regularly with me in the course of my work as a public representative, mainly by women &ndash; housewives who have worked in the home. In many cases, the husband gets the £6 increase, while the wife will gets the £3 increase. This is a bone of contention which needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in child benefit. Given the limited time available to me, I will not go into the question of child care, although I listened with interest to what Deputy Hanafin had to say. Increasing child benefit in this overall context is the way forward; it facilitates those who work inside and outside the home. That is an issue to which I will return at a later date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> I also welcome the major extension of the carer's allowance. Again, there is uniformity across the House on this matter and on the question of caring for elderly people in the home rather than placing them in private nursing homes with the aid of subventions, or in health board contract beds. It makes much more sense, even from an economic point of view, to expand the carer's allowance scheme even further to facilitate older people who live out the end of their days in their own homes. I do not have time to go into the supplementary welfare scheme, rent allowances or the points Deputy Ardagh made on equality in the system in relation to unmarried and married mothers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the budget, the social welfare aspects of which were significant. This Bill will go down in history as a major innovative Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the provisions and broad thrust of the Social Welfare Bill. Looking back over the history of Social Welfare Bills, it can be said that this is a caring Bill which recognises the needs in society and is moving towards assisting those most in need. When we came into Government, we gave a commitment that we would look after the elderly, something which must be broadly welcomed in the House.</P>
      <P>All sides will recognise that major changes and advancements have been made in relation to the medical card. The most important provision is the acknowledgement that pensioners were too far behind other social welfare payments and major steps have been made to rectify that with the £6 per week increase. This is an issue which many people have raised with me. Deputy Haughey referred to adult dependants and the fact that £6 is paid to the person in receipt of the pension while the qualified adult dependant, who more than likely is the spouse of the pensioner, receives 50 per cent of that. That is something about which many people are annoyed. It sometimes seems as if the Department is trying to pull a fast one on them in the way this is paid and explained. The Department should examine the question of the qualified adult dependant allowance paid on a pensioner's book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget has been very positive as regards the elderly, an issue we will have to consider in the future, given the demographic changes. Although we have a young vibrant population, demographic trends suggest there will be a large number of elderly people living here by 2025. That is something we must acknowledge now and to which we must direct the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. There are a few issues which I have raised continually over the past years. In view of escalating house prices and the fact that local authorities are finding it difficult to fulfil their housing obligations, elderly people should be allowed share a house while retaining their entitlements as if they were living alone. This would produce a number of benefits. <Col N="587" /> A house would be released back to the council and it would give a sense of security to elderly people if they were allowed share the burden of running a household.</P>
    <P>We should also consider a provision whereby an elderly person living alone who takes in a tenant, such as a student, would be allowed retain all entitlements. There are large centres inhabited by elderly people near UCC while students live up and down the road. There should be some provision whereby students could move into this accommodation, providing security and company for elderly people who would also maintain their entitlements. Such a scheme would help relieve the housing problem faced by local authorities and by students trying to find accommodation. It would also provide a good social mix and be beneficial to all concerned.</P>
    <P>We will have to revisit the Commission on Social Welfare. That commission was set up in the dark days of the 1980s when the economy was on its knees, the outlook was not positive and Exchequer balances were always in the negative. It is time to re-establish that commission in view of the fact that we have a vibrant economy which is moving forward.</P>
    <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the Bill but I am a little concerned about the multi-agency checkpoints provided for in section 26. This section allows social welfare and other State agency officials, in conjunction with the Garda, to stand in the road and check various details. On paper this sounds like a good idea but it could have an adverse effect, particularly in working class areas. We have spent huge resources getting gardaí back into these areas. Where there had been a complete breakdown of trust between the Garda and the public we now have community policing. If the public see gardaí being involved in checking on fraudulent social welfare claimants it could damage the community trust which has been built up, particularly in urban areas. I have cautioned on this issue and it could create difficulties in the long term.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that these checkpoints will be on roads and motorways. However, over a period I see no reason why it could not happen that a garda could stand outside a housing estate along with other agency officers. This could create huge problems and mistrust. Even though gardaí would be indirectly involved, it would seem to the public and myself that they would be part of an operation to clamp down on social welfare payments. This could undermine the trust we are trying to re-create between the Garda and elements of society.</P>
    <P>The bringing forward of payments has been a bone of contention. The budget has been brought forward by one month and is announced in December as opposed to January and people are annoyed that payments do not follow immediately. There should be a phasing in process whereby payments would be brought into line with the calendar year. This would be a positive <Col N="588" /> measure. I welcome the general provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The International Labour Organisation defines social security as the protection which society provides for its members through a series of public measures against the economic and social distress that otherwise would be caused by the stoppage or substantial reductions of earnings resulting from sickness, maternity, employment injury, unemployment, invalidity, old age and death, and the provision of medical care and subsidies for families with children.</P>
      <P>When the Commission on Social Welfare reported in 1986, the term &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo; referred to schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare. Income maintenance, such as disabled person's maintenance allowance, supplementary welfare allowance and other free schemes referred to schemes administered by health boards. There have been many changes since 1986 with schemes such as disabled person's maintenance allowance coming under the aegis of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Department should be responsible for all schemes defined as income maintenance.</P>
      <P>Since the 1986 report, the Department has made tremendous strides in protecting the less well off, which is incumbent on any Government. Such provisions distinguish a caring society from a non-caring society. Over the years different Governments have improved the social welfare system and many new schemes have been introduced to help the marginalised. The carer's allowance scheme introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Woods has had a significant impact. Subsequent Ministers have improved that scheme and the current Minister has continued that tradition. Up to 11,500 carers will benefit from the changes announced in this Bill and 3,500 people will qualify for carer's allowance for the first time.</P>
      <P>In addition, carers' social insurance records will be preserved and income disregards will be given to carers in their own right. This will be of significant benefit to carers. Free telephone rental and transport are also being provided. I also welcome the £200 per week allowance for respite care which will allow carers take holidays. The Bill provides for an increase of 40 per cent over last year. This means that an extra £18 million is being provided on top of the £45 million spent last year.</P>
      <P>One of the major problems of recent years has been the situation faced by small and low income farmers due to the reduction in the price of cattle and bad weather. I welcome the introduction of the farm assist scheme which will be of enormous benefit to small farmers and those less well off. I know some of these farmers and if they did not receive some assistance they would be forced to sell up. The farm assist scheme will help many of these farmers keep their heads above water and allow them continue to farm and live in the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> Old age pensioners have been singled out for deserved increases in the Bill. The target figure of £100 promised in the programme for Government will be reached within two years. We said we would achieve this over five years but we are ahead of schedule. There has been an increase of over 14 per cent in the last two years in the old age pension. The people who built up the country richly deserve this increase.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in pensions for the self-employed. Many people who were a day or two days short of the ten years did not qualify under the original scheme. The Minister has introduced a new scheme in this area. Regarding the bereavement grant, a funeral is a very expensive and stressful time. The increase in the grant from £100 to £500 will be greatly appreciated and is deserved. The Minister has secured an increase of £317 million this year for the social welfare area. This shows the Government's commitment to the less well off in society.</P>

      <P>I welcome the positive aspects of the Bill. Improvements are always necessary in the area of social welfare. However, while the improvements this year are laudable, the Government side should not bask in reflected glory for too long because these improvements are necessary. One aspect which has become obvious in the context of increases in the cost of living which particularly affect those who are dependent on social welfare is the need to make the social welfare increases sufficient to erode the impact of cost of living increases.</P>
      <P>In terms of the current non-insurance related payments, one will note in the Schedule that the amounts are not extraordinary. There is some recognition in relation to the benefits, but nobody can be complacent when it comes to the amounts of assistance payments, such as unemployment assistance and widows non-contributory pension payments of £73.50. They are inadequate to meet today's requirements. It is not sufficient to state that there has been an increase on last year and previous years because the improvements were necessary. Contrary to what many people believe, the programme the Government has set itself in relation to social welfare increases over the next three years is insufficient to meet today's demands. I hope the Minister will not rest for too long on his oars and assume that everything in the garden is rosy because that is far from the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increases in the old age, disability and invalidity pensions. However, the lack of recognition of child benefit as a means of improving conditions for many families is a sad reflection. I do not understand why that area was <Col N="590" /> omitted. The Minister and his Department could easily have improved the conditions and quality of life of families but they refused to do so. I do not know the reason for this, but the child benefit area is sadly neglected. In comparison to other jurisdictions, Ireland is way behind. I do not know the reason. Some improvements were made over the years, but there is still a long way to go.</P>
    <P>I note the farm assistance programme. However, as somebody who was born and raised in the country and knows something about agriculture, I do not accept that it will in any way address the serious problems in the sector at present. It requires much more attention but that is not happening.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the bereavement grant and I note the provision of pensions for those who were aged over 56 when they first made self-employed contributions. However, this could be extended further in the PAYE sector. The requirement was reduced by the previous Administration to ten per annum. This could be reduced further because the term <i>&ldquo;pro rata&rdquo;</i> should mean what it states.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that a Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, who is a member of the legal profession, who knows something about people's rights and defends these rights in court, would consider introducing section 26. I do not understand why this section has been introduced. It states:</P>
    <P>A social welfare inspector shall, for the purposes of this Act, have power to do all or any of the following:&ndash;</P>
    <P>(a)to enter, without prior notification, at all reasonable times, any premises or place liable to inspection under this section, [These can be determined by the Minister.]</P>
    <P>(d)to examine, either alone or in the presence of any other person, as he or she thinks fit in relation to any matters on which he or she may reasonably require information for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>The section also states:</P>
    <P>(15) A social welfare inspector may, where he or she considers it necessary, be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána when performing any power conferred on a social welfare inspector under this section.</P>

      <P>The alarming aspect is that the Minister had the guts and the gall to introduce this in the Bill. Ironically, these provisions were tested privately over the last six months throughout the country. The late J. Edgar Hoover in his best days would not have thought of such a good measure. The unfortunate Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who was jocosely referred to as Inspector Clouseau in another context some time ago will quickly find himself compared to somebody else of a much more nefarious nature if he is not careful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> Section 26 is disgraceful. It is an attempt to bring the Garda Síochána, the forces of law and order, down on the heads of unfortunate people who may have no other means of existence than the few bob they get on social welfare. I do not condone social welfare, income tax or any other type of fraud. However, it should be recognised that people have rights. One does not condemn people out of hand, intimidate or coerce them. If this is what another Minister meant by zero tolerance, the less we see of it the better. It is a clear attempt to move in on a section of the community and show them how it is done.</P>
    <P> Recently I attended social welfare appeals. I am worried about the attitude of the officers who are carrying out their work in accordance with instructions. What worries me most is that they predetermine a case. They decide that a person is guilty and they then prove it. There are cases where one can have a suspicion or a person can be accused of something, but one must be able to prove it or one will be in serious trouble. In this instance, cases are taken against a vulnerable group in society and people who do not have influence. They are not in a position to go to the courts or the newspapers. An appeal would be a joy to behold where an unfortunate widow or widower is dragged before the courts to prove their innocence.</P>
    <P>Whoever thought up this section should take a sabbatical. If the Minister thought it up in one of his lighter moments, he should also take a sabbatical. It is a clear attempt to erode the rights of the individual. It may be in this area today, and extended to another area tomorrow. I am not given to exaggerating matters of this nature. I recognise the need to ensure that the law is upheld. There will always be people who will try to circumnavigate the rules, but one does not place the common denominator at the lowest level to take everybody out, the innocent as well as the guilty. One does not intimidate people and treat them as if they were guilty before they can explain. I find it worrying that a social welfare inspector can be accompanied by a Garda officer, a customs officer or somebody else. What guarantee is there that people's constitutional rights will be protected?</P>
    <P>The Minister made an extraordinary statement to the House. He said that at the invitation of the Garda Síochána he had decided to mount road blocks and inspections. They must have had little to do when that was suggested. I can think of much they and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could have been doing at that time but which they obviously did not see fit to do. If he is in any way idle in future, he should redirect his attention to his own Department and do some of the things he should be doing. It is a disgrace that he should choose social welfare recipients as targets. I am not suggesting that the Minister of State or his colleague who are in the House tonight are responsible, because I know <Col N="592" /> they agree with me that this legislation is disgraceful and they will live to regret it.</P>

      <P>The last point I want to make is one I have made on many occasions in the past. It is that when there is a &ldquo;get tough&rdquo; attitude towards the poor, social welfare recipients, widows, widowers and so on it also affects people with a disability. The Government will do what it wants, but it will not do so easily because there will be plenty of opposition. I worry about the provision whereby the unfortunate victim of an accident can have his or her entitlements reviewed ten years after losing a limb and be told that he or she is fully recovered and should go back to work and have disability or invalidity pension cut off. That also is disgraceful. I hope there will be no erosion of people's rights in that area, because that would be hotly contested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to concentrate on four items. I regard this provision in the Social Welfare Bill as revolutionary in the wrong sense. The Minister should have checked with me whether eight social welfare inspectors recently visited the co-operative in Belmullet and questioned members of the public who were buying feedstuffs and provisions about where they got the money for such purchases. It seems that this measure is designed to destroy the confidence of people who might be attempting to better themselves in some small way. When we know that former members of the Cabinet and of the party opposite exploited the black economy to the ultimate extent, it is disgraceful that ordinary people who are not expected to sit at home all day moping around the house and degenerating as people because they are on the live register should be accosted by officers of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as they go about their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure whether that is the intent of this section of the Bill, but if it is this Government will stand indicted for trying to destroy and trample upon any incentive these people have. I ask that this provision be withdrawn from this Bill and that the current powers be used. Social welfare officers have absolute authority to carry out assessments and interviews with recipients of various payments from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. There were never votes for politicians as a result of anything they might do in the context of this Department, <Col N="593" /> but this kind of action will destroy the confidence of many thousands of people.</P>
    <P>Let me make three suggestions to the Minister. There has been a spate of armed intrusions, beatings and terrorising of people in rural Ireland. With the increased capacity of roads to take cars at speed, people now leave Dublin in stolen cars, take up residence in empty holiday homes in the west and use these as a base for assaults, raids and nightmare incursions into the privacy of people's houses. There was an incident recently where a man had £29,000 in the house in loose cash. There are thousands of such people who, because of the traditional fear of official investigations, hold loose cash in their houses, hidden where they think it is safe. These people have been beaten up and terrorised. Thousands of them are going to bed this very night terrified of a crunch on the gravel, the sound of an engine or a knock on the door.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If Operation Shannon was introduced as previously, we would know who was and who was not crossing the Shannon. If the Deputy wants evidence, I can produce it. I suggest, since the Deputy is interested, that he might use his influence with the Government to bring in a system of savings bonds with a higher rate of interest for people over 65 up to, let us say, a value of £25,000 so that they could keep their money in a financial institution such as the Post Office where they know it would be safe and they would have ready access to it whenever they needed it. It would be worthwhile for the Government to encourage people to put this loose money into safe locations to which they would have ready access and thus remove the opportunity from those who are unscrupulous enough to beat them up and rob them.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of people were driven out of this country because of economic necessity in the 1940s and 1950s and all Governments did sweet damn all for them except show them the boat to Holyhead or the train to Cork to catch the liner to America. Over the past ten years we introduced reciprocal rights for many Irish citizens in the States or in England. If an Irish pensioner goes to England on a holiday for up to three or six months and signs on at their place of residence in England, perhaps with their son or daughter, they are entitled to free travel. It should be possible to offer the same facility to pensioners who return to Ireland on an occasional basis. For the duration of their visit to family and loved ones, they should have access to a free travel pass on public transport by bus or rail. That would be a small measure of recognition for the work these people did for this country in England, the contributions they made to maintain their families in Ireland during tough economic times and the fact that they are Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> The Centre for Independent Living is a strong movement which provides assistants to help the disabled. I spoke to a quadraplegic about this subject a few days ago. He is doubly incontinent but his personal assistant is obliged to give up his position because the community employment scheme, under which the assistant is employed, ceases after 12 months. A particular strength of personality is required to be a personal assistant. I cannot understand why the position cannot be continued, even under the part-time job option where people with a contract of engagement for 12 months can, in some cases, have it extended to three years.</P>
    <P>People who are confined to wheelchairs need help for the simplest everyday tasks &ndash; getting around the house, using the bathroom and being washed and fed. There is no reason that this small group should not be given the dignity and opportunity to live as other people. This scheme should be extended to three years to encourage these assistants to continue their work.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take on board these three positive suggestions and to get rid of the disgraceful provision in the Bill providing for the establishment of roadblocks at every corner and crossroads in the country.</P>

      <P>This Bill is probably the best package of increases I have seen during my years as a Member of this House. The package is produced against the background of a strong economic performance by the Exchequer. However, more importantly, it recognises the needs of the less well off in society and the fact that ground had to be made up towards ensuring equity and fair play for all.</P>
      <P>The last budget was seen as favouring the better off in society. This budget, particularly the social welfare measures, places the emphasis on the less well off and, in my view, sends the right message. The provisions in the Social Welfare Bill deliver on many commitments in the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and include many welcome measures in support of the needy. They also provide for substantial increases in social welfare payments and significant improvements for older people. That is appropriate given that this year has been designated the Year of the Elderly by the United Nations. I compliment the Government in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for improvements for carers and for the support of families and communities. I welcome the provisions for farmers on low incomes and the measures to help the long-term unemployed to get back into employment. I hope the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will continue to deliver a programme of improvements over the next number of budgets. He certainly set a trend in his first two budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> There is still a long way to go. It is just and proper that as resources become available due to our improved economic performance they should be spread fairly and equitably in society, particularly to those most in need. I welcome the £6 increase in the old age pension, an increase of 8.3 per cent. The pension is progressing quickly towards the £100 per week minimum income promised for the year 2002. I agree with a previous Opposition speaker that the figure should be reviewed if current economic improvements continue.</P>
    <P>The £3 increase for all other social welfare recipients on maximum rates, a 4.3 per cent increase, is also welcome. Although it is more than the inflation rate, it is still not enough. Everybody would wish to do more. I am particularly concerned, as I have said on numerous occasions, about the position of widows and widowers. For many years they have sought a better deal but they have not been successful. I have strongly advocated that the free schemes in the social welfare system, such as television licences, ESB allowances, telephone rental and so forth, should be extended to widows and widowers.</P>
    <P>A married man of 50 years of age with five or six children who is in receipt of an invalidity pension is entitled to these benefits. When he dies his widow, when most vulnerable and in particular need of these schemes, finds her income halved and these benefits taken away. The Minister must give consideration to this issue in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements in the carer's allowance, which will cost an additional £18 million per annum, implementing most of the review recommendations. I also welcome the improvement in pensions for self-employed people who are over 56 years of age where pensions are extended with at least five years' contributions. I welcome the new means tested farm assist scheme for low income farmers. This will benefit 6,600 smallholders and a further 6,800 low income farmers and will cost £45 million per annum, a significant amount. There is a similar scheme for low income fishermen, although there are not many fishermen in my constituency. However, it will be most beneficial for maritime counties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the new bereavement grant which is increased to £500 with easier qualifying criteria. The scheme will cost £10 million per annum. It is important that the Department takes steps to ensure this welcome increase is not abused by unscrupulous undertakers and that the money reaches those at whom it is directed. The changes in PRSI, including the abolition of the employment and training levy, are welcome as are other measures, such as the amendment to the Pensions Act and the extension of the scope of the personal public service number introduced last year.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's concern about abuses of the social welfare system and I am aware that the measures he has introduced to date have been successful. Unfortunately, there <Col N="596" /> are people within the system who adopt a professional approach to abusing it. Not alone do they defraud the State but they also take money which should be diverted to improving the position of those most in need. However, I disagree with the recent proposal to establish a multi-agency checkpoint system which will involve the Garda Síochána, social welfare representatives, the Revenue Commissioners and so forth.</P>
    <P>No Department has improved its operations as much as the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs over recent years. In such a Department there should be sufficient alternative methods to track down social welfare cheats. The multi-agency checkpoint system will create huge difficulties. Imagine the position of a young garda living in a housing estate who depends on the goodwill and co-operation of the local community and his or her neighbours in administering the law. He or she will be obliged to stand at a checkpoint to investigate suspected social welfare abuse by these neighbours. That will undermine the role of the Garda Síochána and lead to a lack of confidence and trust. There must be more practical ways of dealing with this problem. I urge the Minister to reconsider. I agree with the principle of abolishing abuses of the social welfare system but I do not agree with this method of enforcement.</P>
    <P>Carers have been taken for granted by consecutive Governments and I am glad the Minister acted on the proposals of the interdepartmental review of the carer's allowance. This will benefit 11,500 carers. I also welcome that almost 3,500 people will qualify for the carer's allowance for the first time. Those who care for children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance will be eligible for carer's allowance and eligibility will be extended to the carer of anyone between 16 years and 65 years old who require full-time care and attention. I am pleased the Minister has decided to relax the residency conditions for receipt of the allowance and the full-time care and attention rule; the carer's social insurance record will be preserved and the Department will give income disregards to carers in their own right.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems facing carers is isolation. I welcome the extension of the free telephone allowance to persons in receipt of the carer's allowance and the extension of the free travel scheme to carers of people receiving constant attendance allowance and prescribed relative allowance. I also welcome the £200 annual contribution towards respite care. Overall, this year there will be a 40 per cent increase in payments to carers, amounting to an additional £80 million on top of the £45 million spent last year.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other improvements which could be made and I hope this will happen in due course. It is desirable that as many people as possible should be cared for in their own homes; the State would make a huge saving. The appropriate payments should be made and perhaps the means test should be looked at.</P>
    <P>As regards the new farm assist scheme, most <Col N="597" /> farmers would prefer not to have to avail of social welfare, regardless of the title. However, as the reality of Agenda 2000 dawns on us, there will be more demands for social welfare from farmers. I welcome the new scheme which represents an important development of income support for farmers. We are all aware of the current difficulties facing low income farmers. I am pleased this scheme will be an ongoing feature of the social welfare system. The 1999 budget provides for a full year additional allocation of £15 million to pay for this scheme. Earlier this year, a two-phase fodder scheme costing £41 million was introduced. I wonder if this was the best way to spend that money. It was a fire brigade measure. People in disadvantaged areas were selling fodder to their neighbours, who were not even in a disadvantaged area, at a huge profit. It was a contradiction and there were examples to be found all over the country.</P>
    <P>The Bill demonstrates the commitment of the Government and the Minister to the elderly, carers and less well-off in society. It is in keeping with the proud tradition of Fianna Fáil Ministers and their performance in the Department of Social Welfare. All decent increases and innovation over the years have been introduced by Fianna Fáil Ministers. We should compare and contrast that with the performance of Ministers from other parties, which left a great deal to be desired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We can judge any Social Welfare Bill under a number of headings. Is this Bill fair, just, responsive, flexible and designed in a way which will help individuals and groups fulfil their potential? The Bill certainly adheres to the criteria of flexibility and responsiveness. The budget has been well covered. However, it needs to be emphasised that in the Year of the Elderly, this Minister has been extremely responsive to the needs, cares and frustrations of the elderly. In our programme for Government we stated we would ensure a significant increase in the old age pension in five years &ndash; we are now on our second budget and we have at least three more to come. This year, the old age pension is about £89 per week which is a significant increase on what was granted by the Rainbow Government. This is welcome.</P>
      <P>Everyone must deal with the misery and anguish of losing loved ones. Many of us are aware of the difficulty in paying funeral expenses. We are all satisfied that the £100 death grant was not sufficient. I welcome the increase of that grant, in one fell swoop, from £100 to £500. In cases of great necessity, supplementary welfare is also available. This assurance should be made to those who are concerned about meeting funeral costs. It is extraordinary here that the one thing people are concerned about is paying funeral expenses; it is a bill which no-one wants to leave lying in the ledger book. The Minister has responded in a very caring way as regards this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> It is a fact of life that many people applied for pensions well after the date of their eligibility. This has been a sore point for many years. The former Minister, Deputy De Rossa made some effort to allow people claim back to 1997. However, the current Minister has taken this issue by the scruff of the neck and has provided £100 million extra so that the elderly can claim back payment from the time they were eligible for their pension under this Administration. I remember calling on the Minister before the budget to include this provision in this Bill and I am gratified he has done so. I am astounded by the number of people who have contacted me since to say they missed out on the date of eligibility; happily many of them will now have an extra few pounds in their pockets.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about the carer's allowance. We would all like to keep our elderly at home for as long as possible and to ensure that they are looked after properly. This Bill is a step in the right direction as there are significant increases in the carer's allowance; 11,500 carers already in the system will benefit from this Bill and 3,500 will qualify for the first time, which is welcome. Carers will receive free telephone rental and free travel. Last year the carer's allowance was increased by £18 million and this year that figure is £45 million. We are moving in the right direction and these are significant improvements.</P>
    <P>We will have to ascertain the cost of keeping the elderly in private nursing homes, given that the space in our community hospitals is not adequate. Should we continue to reduce the means test for carers? Should we allow family members to be more responsible in keeping their relatives at home? In view of the escalating costs of private nursing homes, the time is nigh for a statistical study of the cost of removing the means test <i>vis-à-vis </i>paying people a supplement to stay in a nursing home. The demands will be even greater with the removal of the responsibility on the immediate family to contribute to a nursing home subvention. More people will obviously be inclined to indicate that it would be preferable for elderly people to be put into nursing homes rather than kept at home. As that cost escalates it will become comparatively less expensive to keep people in their own environments. All elderly people want to remain at home for as long as they can, until they absolutely need complete medical care. As a Government and a caring community, we should try to achieve that.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he is willing to look at the cost implications over the coming years. It is interesting that the only provision which Fine Gael Members could criticise in the Bill is the multi-agency approach and inspections. People have been stopped at checkpoints without this legislation in place. Is it necessary to include this provision in the Bill? If it is possible to do that in the present circumstances, then it is time to review the provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid am a roinnt leis na Teachtaí Gormley agus Joe Higgins. I oppose the Bill because it fails the test of the national anti-poverty strategy which states that social welfare must &ldquo;provide sufficient income for all those concerned to move out of poverty and to live in a manner compatible with human dignity&rdquo;. The key phrase is &ldquo;moving out of poverty&rdquo;. The level of social welfare increases in the Bill will not help to move people out of poverty but will keep social welfare dependants lagging far behind the rest of society. Given the failure of successive Governments to deal with education and employment disadvantage the message from the Bill and the 1999 budget is at best &ldquo;as you were&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the context of the biggest budget surplus in the history of the State, the social welfare increases are very disappointing. They continue the failed policy of recent years. Writing in <i>Poverty Today </i>last year, Professor Brian Nolan of the ESRI stated, &ldquo;We have so far failed to use our new found wealth to make serious inroads into poverty to ensure that everyone has enough to live with dignity and participate fully in our society.&rdquo; In its pre-budget commentary, the ESRI warned that the continuation of the policy pursued in recent years would see a rise in the numbers in poverty and make the national anti-poverty strategy's poverty reduction target unattainable.</P>
      <P>The Bill continues the policy of previous years and thus fails for one central reason. Its fundamental failure is to ignore the advice of the Combat Poverty Agency which called for an increase in social welfare rates in line with the increase in average industrial earnings rather than the rate of inflation. In failing to do this, the Bill ensures that the poverty gap will continue to widen. Is it the view of the Minister and the Government that £72 per week is an adequate income for a single person, £115.20 for a couple, £141.60 for a couple with two children or £168 for a couple with four children? It is impossible to live in a manner compatible with human dignity on such paltry incomes, which represent the hourly rates of some of the wealthy in our society, and not even the wealthiest at that.</P>
      <P>The increases for pensioners are welcome, if long overdue, but one must ask why the rate of increase for others is considerably lower. Why was there no comparable increase across the board? Many people are concerned that the Victorian concept of the deserving and the undeserving seeping into legislation reflects the thinking of this Government. It deeply affects the daily life condition of tens of thousands of the most disadvantaged of our people. This thinking is all too clear in the increased powers in the Bill for social welfare inspectors, including the by now notorious power for the Garda to set up vehicle checkpoints. This has caused justifiable anger at a time when the multi-million pound tax frauds of financial institutions and their high flying clients are exposed on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> The Bill creates the potential for abuse of powers by these inspectors. The danger of targeting entire estates is obvious. Are we to be faced with checkpoints at the entrances to housing estates which suffer high unemployment and welfare dependency? There is more than an element of the publicity stunt about this measure because the Minister knows well that the actual level of social welfare fraud is relatively low. This measure creates the impression that many social welfare recipients are claiming illegitimately, thus stigmatising people who are already disadvantaged. It ignores the fact that there are few opportunities in the so-called black economy for welfare recipients. Participants in the black economy are much more likely to be in full-time employment and doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; not declared to the Revenue than they are to be working and claiming social welfare.</P>
    <P>Welfare recipients are already subject to stringent checks and constant monitoring. There is no comparison between the resources available for this monitoring in social welfare and health board offices throughout the country and those of the Revenue Commissioners, who are tasked with the policing of those who defraud the compliant taxpayer of sums many times in excess of those lost through welfare fraud.</P>
    <P>There is some improvement in the carer's allowance scheme but the personal rate is increased by only £3 per week. Like similar increases in other areas, it is totally inadequate. The Government, like its predecessors, has yet to give real recognition to the 24 hour care provided by thousands of people at a huge saving to the State.</P>
    <P>I wish to relate the provisions of the Bill to the current housing crisis. The entire focus of coverage of this crisis has been on those on middle incomes who have been squeezed out of the market. Little attention has been paid to those who were on local authority housing waiting lists before this crisis began and who are still there, joined by thousands more as the effects of the shortage creep up the economic ladder. Those in direct need of local authority housing are dependent on social welfare. Gone are the days when such housing was available to them at a low rent while higher earners could rely on the market, yet the Government has set its face against a comprehensive local authority house building programme. As a result housing poverty is widespread and is directly related to the other forms of poverty which the Bill all too sadly fails to address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party opposes the Bill as it continues the State's reliance on means testing in all aspects of social welfare payments. Means testing is an affront to the dignity of those seeking assistance from the State and an unwarranted level of detail of people's lives is sought. By continuing means testing the Department sets acceptable levels of impoverishment for the poorer sections of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> It causes a duplication of work. Anything the means test does in terms of preserving the State from excessive distribution of financial resources could be more efficiently done through the integration of a personal taxation system with a guaranteed basic income system. The recent Social Welfare Consolidation Act provides the legal basis and mechanism for a guaranteed basic income, but sets it at an unacceptably low level so that the level of supplementary welfare allowance and the manner of its implementation is such as to cause unnecessary stress to community welfare officers and attack the fundamental dignity of persons applying for that payment.</P>
    <P>The State is unwilling or unable to provide for carers who give a crucial 24 hour service. The Bill demonstrates the contingency based system operated by this and previous Administrations. Instead of providing a guaranteed basic income system, which would give a decent income for those who are needed for care in the home, and taxing anything above that basic assistance, the State relies on means tested grants and allowances to paper over the cracks in society. The Bill continues in the spirit of the Department by treating citizens with suspicion and spending taxpayers' money investigating them at roadblocks and inspections, rather than examining the entire system and beginning to reform it from scratch.</P>
    <P>A recent question I raised with the Minister, and which was referred to by Deputy Ó Caoláin, revealed the disproportionate amount of money spent in pursuing those who defraud the social welfare system compared with the amount spent investigating the big fish who defraud the tax system and against whom the Revenue Commissioners are apparently powerless to act. In 1997 there were 11,185 overpayments amounting to £14.5 million, which was attributed to fraud or suspected fraud. A further 23,499 overpayments amounting to £6.2 million arose due to a variety of other reasons, including claimant and departmental errors.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with fraud of the order of £14.5 million, which is a small sum compared to the amount of money defrauded through tax evasion. Nonetheless, we have a distorted view that these people should be pursued and we adopt a gung ho attitude towards that pursuit. That would be eliminated if there were a proper guaranteed basic income system. Such a system is much more efficient, has been costed by the Conference of Religious in Ireland and has been advocated by the Green Party since its inception. I hope the group set up under Partnership 2000 to examine this will come forward with concrete proposals so that we can look afresh at the manner in which social welfare is administered in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned carers. This is not a good Bill for them and the Carers Association has made its views known on this. It called for the abolition of the means test but there has been no significant change except for single carers. It also wanted an end to the rule that carers must live under the same roof to qualify for the carer's <Col N="602" /> allowance. There is some adjustment in the Bill but only 400 carers will benefit. The association also wanted the introduction of a carer's benefit for those who must give up paid work to care at home but has received nothing in this regard. Another demand was to increase the weekly income disregard to £200 net income per week for married couples so that carers could qualify for the carer's allowance in their own right. Again, they have received nothing.</P>
    <P>There has been a complete neglect in this area. It does not make economic sense, never mind the humanitarian aspect. Deputy Batt O'Keeffe stated that, if one compares the costings and externalities, the State is clearly saving money. By neglecting carers, we are throwing money down the drain. We have an ageing population. We know the demographic will change significantly and we have the reports supporting this from the ESRI. This is a huge gap and the Minister should re-examine the area. I know from my constituency that there are many dissatisfied people who feel very let down by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Bill must be strongly opposed. It does little to address the need for justice and equality for the poor in society and those in need of material support. It must also be strongly opposed for the notorious section 26, which gives the extraordinary power to social welfare inspectors to join with members of the Garda, customs officers and any other agency of the State which can be mustered in the so-called multi-agency vehicle checkpoints. This is a draconian provision and I am not surprised that, when it was first mooted, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs was apparently too embarrassed to come out and defend it, with the result that we witnessed the extraordinary situation for several days of a senior civil servant carrying out the Minister's dirty work. The Minister, in a very lame fashion, has attempted to justify it in his speech.</P>
      <P>What we are witnessing here is a deliberate attempt to target unemployed people and communities and to create a layer of uncertainty and fear and an air of nervousness in them. The State is being given the power in the Bill to have so-called multi-agency vehicle checkpoints outside large working class communities, where every vehicle coming and going can be stopped and the occupants interrogated about from where they are coming, where they are going, what they are doing and so forth. It is an absolutely intolerable power to trawl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key question is what is the agenda. It is clear it is not to root out the supposed massive fraud among a vast array of unemployed people but to create a climate of fear and a badgering atmosphere among unemployed people so that they feel compelled and pressurised to take up the disgustingly low-paid jobs on offer from the many employers who constantly moan about the fact they cannot get workers to fill them. How could they give the level of wages they propose <Col N="603" /> to pay? Section 26 of the Bill ties in with the Small Firms Association and its agenda, which is opposed to the national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour being introduced in 2000. The association enthusiastically supports this measure because it wants unemployed people badgered into low-paid jobs to fill the vacancies for which people cannot be found because the wages are so miserable.</P>
    <P>The process is to criminalise the unemployed, not because they are fraudsters but to suit the agenda of powerful business interests in society. A building worker out on disability or made redundant when a construction job finishes who goes with some tools to an ageing parent or to do someone a favour could find themselves criminalised by this procedure and treated as a suspect. Their tools would be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that there was something irregular or criminal in what they were doing. That is shameful. Deputy Aylward has severe reservations about this aspect. Deputy Lenihan is present in the House and will probably contribute next.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter which we should have been permitted to raise by way of private notice question because of the necessity to get answers from the Tánaiste who regrettably is not present but is represented by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>This is one of the worst industrial disasters, in terms of local impact, in recent years. The impact has been aggravated by the manner of decision making and communication to a loyal workforce. The decision was a bolt from the blue. Shop stewards had intuitively picked up something in the wind last Friday but no information was forthcoming. On Monday morning local management stunned the workforce by making this final and completely unexpected announcement.</P>
      <P>Today's newspaper coverage makes harrowing reading. Industrial crises are invariably painful but it is unforgivable on the part of the company to announce the termination of the employment of a loyal, long serving workforce in this fashion. It is difficult to believe that any reputable senior management, notwithstanding being based outside the country, would handle so-called reduction in demand for its products in Portarlington in this manner in a plant where the good industrial relations were acknowledged by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Pat Gallagher, has posed the question which everyone in Portarlington wants to hear answered. When did the Tánaiste learn that all was not well at Avon <Col N="604" /> Arlington? When was she informed that the plant would close? Why was the main trade union concerned, SIPTU, not advised of the imminent disaster? </P>
    <P>It is difficult to conceive that the Government was not made aware of the imminent closure of a plant which has such local significance. The early warning unit in the Department is still functioning. Did it not know that there were problems on the horizon and, if so, what action was taken? What actions did the Tánaiste take with the IDA? What contacts took place with the corporate management? Did the Tánaiste meet the company about the problems on the horizon and, if not, why not?</P>
    <P>This is a devastating blow for Portarlington and its surrounding hinterland. The cessation of Odlums, Bord na Móna, the local ESB power station and Butlers Engineering have all preceded the departure of Avon Arlington. No town can absorb this sequence of job losses. Three hundred people were employed full-time and up to 200 in an ancillary capacity. The devastation is more serious since in many cases there is more than one employee per household.</P>
    <P>Almost by stealth a number of serious closures or major redundancies have happened in the past year or so. The scale of the losses in Clonmel, Donegal, Killala and Portarlington is alarming and demonstrates the fragility of some of our apparent success. The situation may not have attracted the attention it warrants because of general economic buoyancy but it is proving difficult and will continue to prove difficult to replace stable, long established jobs in the areas so badly affected.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is becoming the Minister for task forces. We wish them well. In the interim those hurting in Portarlington will want to hear answers from the Tánaiste how this disaster crept up on her. I am sure she has good reasons for not being present in the House. I ask the Minister of State to apply his mind to giving us answers rather than reading out a deadpan script. It is regrettable &ndash; I mean no disrespect to the Ceann Comhairle's office &ndash; that this important issue was not handled by way of a private notice question. Reading out a script is not the way to deal with something as serious as this.</P>
    <P>I hope the State is assisting the trade union involved, SIPTU, to negotiate the redundancy package and that the infrastructure is being put in place to advise the workers of the way around the obstacles in their path.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss of 265 full-time jobs and a further 150 casual workers is a cruel blow for the people of the Midlands. The widespread shock and deep sense of disappointment has shaken the community to the core. I acknowledge the reaction of the Tánaiste, her visit today to the plant in Portarlington and the announcement of a special task force under the chairmanship of the Laois county manager, Mr. Michael Malone. I wish the team well in its endeavour but it will <Col N="605" /> need the care and attention of the IDA and officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment at the highest level if it is to succeed. There are now three special and urgent task forces charged with the responsibility of job creation as a fire brigade operation in the Midlands. It was with much irony that the first meeting of the task force took place tonight in Portarlington in the same room where public representatives, myself included, met the Tánaiste in December to impress on her the poor job situation in County Laois which was almost in crisis before this week's shocking news.</P>
      <P>Even without the job losses at Avon Arlington there are just under 1,000 people unemployed and signing in Portarlington, over 1,000 ten miles away in Portlaoise and 800 in Rathdowney. The stark reality is that the Government and State agencies in particular have failed the Midlands and County Laois. We have watched with envy as announcements and initiatives on jobs are made week after week with no reference to County Laois. The IDA's annual report shows the Midland region bottom of the national league and County Laois bottom of the Midlands league. In premiership parlance, County Laois is towards the bottom of the Vauxhall Conference.</P>
      <P>Today's disbelief and shock throughout north Laois and east Offaly will rapidly be replaced by anger and despair on the part of my constituents unless real and positive progress is reported as a matter of extreme urgency. The plant in Portarlington was in being for 23 years and was placed in the town to soften the blow of huge job losses in Bord na Móna and the ESB as well as traditional locally based industries that collapsed in the milling and textile area. Much of the workforce in Portarlington is drawn from the rural villages of Bracknagh, Geashill, Walsh Island, Cloneygowan, Ballybrittas, Emo, Rosenallis and Clonaslee where there is no alternative work or career prospects. The only news they are waiting for is what is happening in Brussels about CAP reform.</P>
      <P>Why did the early warning system in the Department not signal this catastrophe as rumours of an impending closure circulated in the area last year? What contact was made with the parent company? Why did no one in authority visit the United States to mount a salvage operation? Was it known to the Tánaiste that operations by the parent company in Poland where labour costs are cheaper would put the Portarlington plant in jeopardy? The parent company is solvent and thriving and alternative product lines might have been explored. It appears closure is accepted with no prospects of saving any of the 400 jobs. Unlike the multinational job losses in urban areas &ndash; Deputy Rabbitte's constituency being one &ndash; there is no urban mass to absorb the fall-out. Portarlington has a population of 5,000 with the aforementioned villages having no more than a couple of hundred families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four points must be considered. An attractive and acceptable redundancy package must be set in place to alleviate the economic hardship <Col N="606" /> inflicted on the workforce by the loss of a wage packet. The company can afford such an arrangement and it must be delivered. It is acknowledged by Avon Arlington that the workforce has at all times been dedicated, committed and flexible. Excellent working relations had been established between management and SIPTU. This has been acknowledged by the parent company.  A firm of professional career consultants should be engaged without delay and based in Portarlington to prepare an out placement programme for employment and assist with the preparation of CVs, interview skills, etc.</P>
    <P>FÁS must prepare a skills audit without delay, not only for the town of Portarlington but the surrounding areas of north Laois and east Offaly so that a potential investor can be aware of the skills in the area. If there is a deficiency resulting in a less than attractive workforce, this should be set right by proper and adequate training programmes as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Every effort must be made to provide a replacement industry, whether by way of investment in the Avon plant or otherwise, and a firm timeframe must be placed within which the task force must report.</P>
    <P>Counties Laois and Offaly cannot absorb job losses on such a scale. With an already higher than average jobless rate, the term &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is no exaggeration. I wish the task force and the Minister well in their endeavours. The people of Laois and Offaly await a positive and active response sooner rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste asked me to take the Adjournment Debate tonight as she is unable to return on time from her visit to Portarlington this afternoon to meet with the management, workers and trade unions of Arlington (Avon) Limited and to address the first meeting of the task force.</P>
      <P>I, too, was greatly disappointed at the yesterday's announcement by Avon Products, Inc., that its subsidiary, Arlington Ltd., will close its Portarlington plant in County Laois at the end of April with the loss of 265 permanent and 80 seasonal jobs. It comes as a great shock, both to the employees and the people of Portarlington and County Laois. Over the last 25 years, Arlington Ltd. has been a major employer providing high quality employment in County Laois.</P>
      <P>Arlington Ltd. was established in 1974 and was subsequently taken over by Avon Products Inc., New York, in 1977. It is engaged mainly in the manufacture of jewellery and, to a lesser extent, cosmetics, soap and aerosols.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first indication of the impending closure was on Wednesday, 24 February 1999, when the Tánaiste met the Irish management of the company and Avon's decision to close the Portarlington plant was disclosed. While the possibility of saving these jobs was discussed, the company explained that it has evaluated and analysed all possible options in attempting to avoid closing <Col N="607" /> the plant and that its production volumes of jewellery have been steadily decreasing since 1991. Since then, total production has reduced from 10 million units to last year's 2.6 million units. Avon's market share continues to decline due to competition from developing markets and there are no indications of a reversal in this trend. Avon's only other jewellery manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic have also been negatively impacted and last year the company was forced to close two of its three production facilities in those locations. To compound this, demand for soap, which is also manufactured at Arlington, has also been decreasing, from 16 million units in the early 1980s to less than 4 million units in 1998, with continuing decreases forecast for 1999.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this decline in the market, Avon had continued to invest in Arlington, adding new production systems and equipment as well as the addition of new product categories. However, these categories do not generate sufficient revenue or sufficient full-time employment to justify maintaining the production facility.</P>
    <P>Avon has stated that the unavoidable decision to close Arlington in no way reflects on the ability of the workers. The company has praised the outstanding relationship it has had both with its workforce and with the local community. Avon is acutely aware of the impact this decision will have on the local economy and particularly the people of Portarlington. For this reason, and for the sake of the workforce, Avon has undertaken to work with IDA Ireland and other Government bodies to minimise the impact on employees and on the community.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies and the House that IDA Ireland, for its part, is actively pursuing a strategy to increase employment in County Laois. As part of the agency's marketing efforts to enhance the attractiveness of the county for inward investors, it entered into a land swap with Laois County Council in 1997. This resulted in the establishment of a new 45-acre business and industrial park by IDA Ireland on Mountrath Road, Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1997, IDA Ireland invested approximately £500,000 for the provision of all the necessary services and landscaping to enable the park to be established as a quality location to compete for overseas mobile investment. At the same time, IDA Ireland issued a BES certificate to private developers for the construction of a 20,000 square foot unit at the park, and construction of the new facility commenced in October 1998.</P>
    <P>The availability of this new business and industrial park and an advance factory facility is critical to IDA Ireland's marketing programme for inward investment to the area. With this new facility coming on stream in the very near future, IDA Ireland will concentrate its efforts on securing a client for County Laois at the earliest possible stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> Enterprise Ireland is also active in the region. Three proposals for expansion in Midlands Furniture Ltd., Independent Microlabs Ltd. and Irish Dairy Services Ltd. were approved by Enterprise Ireland in 1998 which will create a total of 50 new jobs. In addition, the natural resource sector is strongly represented in the county. Laois Sawmills, Portlaoise, supplies timber products to the furniture and horticultural sectors and Vasa Ltd., Stradbally, produces mink pelts, utilising the waste material from the poultry industry. The purchase by South of Ireland Asphalt Company of the former assets of Butler Engineering Ltd. and Butler International Portarlington is reviving the fortunes of the steel industry in the north of the county and building on the skilled workforce already in place. SIAC is also providing advance industrial space for new and existing enterprises wishing to set up in Portarlington.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Laois County Enterprise Board has created over 600 jobs over the past five years. The board organised a unique enterprise exhibition for County Laois last year. This exhibition was a clear statement of both the quality and quantity of local enterprise throughout the county and shows that indigenous industry is thriving in County Laois.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the ongoing efforts of the agencies, in view of the impending closure of Arlington and the significant job losses involved, the Tánaiste has ordered an immediate response to the company's announcement with the establishment of a task force. The task force will be chaired by Mr. Michael Malone, Laois county manager, and comprise representatives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, Laois County Enterprise Board, SIPTU, IBEC and local industry.</P>
    <P>The company has undertaken to work closely with the task force to assist the workers in exploring the most suitable education, training, employment and enterprise options available to them. The company will co-operate with IDA Ireland in arrangements to market the suitability of the plant for a replacement industry.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste met representatives of the workforce and their trades union representatives today. She also met the task force to impress upon it at first hand the urgency of its task.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference for the task force will be to secure alternative job creating enterprise, both from overseas and indigenous investors for Laois; to provide an immediate skills assessment and suitable training opportunities for the affected workers; and to provide the necessary information and assistance to any employees who may wish to establish their own enterprises.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the task force has been asked to liaise with public and private sector and community bodies which can assist in promoting the area for investment and job creation. FÁS, in conjunction with the company, trades union representatives and Laois County Enterprise Board, will commence an immediate intervention programme to provide assistance to employees, that <Col N="609" /> is, job seeking skills, interview techniques, early retirement advice, investment opportunities, CV services and counselling; to establish the skills pool which is available to new investment; and to assess skills of workers to be laid off and assist employees with training and re-training, identification of job opportunities, job skills requirements and opportunities for self-employment.</P>
    <P>This announcement is clearly a major blow for the workforce and for the area generally. I am hopeful that the work of the task force and the generally positive situation of the economy will lead to early re-employment of the people concerned. I thank all the local Oireachtas Members for their personal concern and absolute attention to this sad industrial catastrophe since it was announced. On behalf of the Tánaiste, the Government and all of the State agencies reporting to the Tánaiste and our Department, I assure the House that we will do our utmost to redress the position as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this question this evening. I want to highlight a specific case and to make a general point.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance on 16 February to ask him if a tax or duty concession to purchase a car will be given to a person in Dublin 12 who has two artificial eyes and whose wife drives for him &ndash; a simple, straightforward and clear case. This man is unable to drive because of his disability.</P>
      <P>The reply I received was that the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme provides tax relief for the purchase of a vehicle whether for use as a driver or as a passenger, and six different types of disability were listed. The reply stated that the scheme targets relief at persons who are severely and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility. It stated that the scheme is operated on a day to day basis and that visual impairment is not a disability which comes within the scope of the specified criteria laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all honesty, if someone has two artificial eyes and does not qualify for assistance for the purchase of a car as a passenger because they do not have the required disability, what disability must one have to qualify for this benefit? The answer, according to the six categories the Minister listed, includes persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons wholly without the use of one of the legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such as they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have <Col N="610" /> serious difficulties of movement of the lower limb.</P>
    <P>Since I raised this question in the Dáil last week, and since publicity was given to the gentleman concerned &ndash; a very good natured man who copes with his disability with good humour &ndash; I have been contacted by a number of organisations and individuals who pointed out the hardship they are experiencing, including a couple whose son has a condition called hemiplegia, a cerebral palsy condition where the child is literally, at the age of nine, like a stroke victim on one side, and who have been denied this benefit. There is a general application in this case, but there is a very specific one in the case of the person I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I ask that this man be given this concession, to which he is clearly entitled if any sense of justice has been applied to the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. I want it specifically for this man because it is justified. I want the Minister of State to confirm that this man, who has two artificial eyes and who is sitting with his wife in the Public Gallery waiting to hear the reply, is entitled to the disabled persons tax concession as a passenger. Is there any clearer case than this one to illustrate the unfairness of the regulations as they are drawn in the six categories listed?</P>
    <P>This is not a case of someone who has a slight impairment. This person has no eyes, he has two artificial ones. He cannot get around in a car without being driven. If the 1994 legislation was passed for anybody, it was passed for my constituent.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to confirm that my constituent will be given his due right under the law and that the scheme will be reviewed and extended to include people like the child I mentioned earlier whose parents are also sitting in the Gallery and who have a right to expect that the law of the land, in the way it is regulated, is applied fairly, evenly and justly. I hope the Minister of State will not give me the sort of reply I got to the parliamentary question last week because I am not going away. I am determined to see that changes are brought about to this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, introduced an exemption from road tax for vehicles adapted or constructed for and used by disabled persons who in the main would have been confined to wheelchairs. The scheme was later extended to allow relief from VAT and from vehicle excise duty on the acquisition of a vehicle and from excise duty on the fuel used. Vehicle excise duty was replaced by vehicle registration tax &ndash; VRT &ndash; with effect from 1 January 1993. Medical certification was by the disabled person's own doctor and required that the person be &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his or her legs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A framework for a new consolidated scheme of reliefs was provided for under section 92 of the <Col N="611" /> Finance Act, 1989. The regulations made under that Act set out criteria for eligibility for the reliefs as well as specifying their scope and various procedures to be complied with to qualify for benefit. The resultant Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989 came into operation in December of that year.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the working of the provisions set out in the 1989 scheme was carried out in 1993-94 and resulted in the adoption of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. The tax concessions have never been available to persons, such as this category of individual, who fail to meet the basic requirement of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The specified medical criteria apply to persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without both legs; persons wholly without or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A person must satisfy one or more of the medical criteria laid down in the regulations. The fundamental requirement for qualification for relief is that the person is seriously and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility. Medical certification is provided by the senior area medical officer in the local health board. If a person is refused the required medical certificate, the case may be appealed to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal &ndash; an independent board whose decision is final. As was pointed out in reply to several parliamentary questions on this topic, many persons appeal who do not meet the basic scheme requirements.</P>
      <P>The benefits which apply under the disabled drivers' scheme are relief from VAT and VRT up to a maximum of £7,500 in connection with the cost of both the purchase and adaptation of a suitably adapted vehicle for the use of a qualifying disabled driver. Further relief is available in respect of a replacement vehicle every two years thereafter; relief from VAT and VRT up to a maximum of £12,500 in connection with the cost of purchase and adaptation of a suitably adapted vehicle by a family member residing with and responsible for the transport of a qualifying disabled person. Further relief is available in respect of a replacement vehicle every two years thereafter; repayment of excise duty on up to 600 gallons of fuel per annum for use in transporting the disabled person in the tax relieved vehicle; and exemption from the repayment of road tax on the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> These reliefs are also available in respect of specially adapted vehicles purchased by certain qualifying charitable organisations for the transport of disabled persons. These are generous tax reliefs for the qualifying persons and are costly to the Exchequer. It is estimated that the relief cost the Exchequer approximately £14.4 million in 1998 and will cost approximately £16.5 million in 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. This is an increase from approximately £4 million originally in 1994.</P>
      <P>As the House will see, the medial criteria relate essentially to disabilities which seriously and permanently impair the physical mobility of the person concerned and reflect the origins of the scheme as a relief for disabled persons who are confined to wheelchairs but who nevertheless are capable of driving suitably adapted cars.</P>
      <P>Visual impairment is not a disability which comes within the scope of the specified medical condition which, although disabling, may not compromise the physical mobility of the person concerned to a serious degree. The principle issue of concern expressed in connection with the relief is in relation to the medical criteria. Arguably, the pressure to extend the scheme is driven by its valuable reliefs, giving access to tax free cars and fuel, essentially for life. The scheme cannot be extended to all and every person who suffers from some form of disablement or disability &ndash; however deserving each group considers its case to be. Requests are continually made for the medical criteria to be relaxed so as to extend the range of qualifying disabilities to include other categories, notably those suffering from, among other ailments, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, the effects of stroke, heart conditions, cerebral palsy and epilepsy&mdash;</P>

      <P>In addition, there are demands to allow persons not fully meeting the current criteria relating to the loss of limbs to be admitted. The number of potential beneficiaries is unclear but, according to lobbyists for the disabled, there are up to 350,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> The logic of starving the probation and welfare service of adequate and urgently needed resources is difficult to understand. It is totally incomprehensible when it is compared with its sister organisation, the prison service. The probation and welfare service deals with 5,000 offenders each year. The prison service deals with 10,000 offenders. It costs an average of £52,000 to keep someone in prison for one year. It costs a mere £2,000 to keep someone under the supervision of the probation and welfare service. An average of 70,000 of those who go through the prison service re-offend. On average, the probation and welfare service supervision of offenders has an 80 per cent success rate. While it takes more than 1,600 prison officers to manage a prison throughput of 10,000 per annum a mere 148.5 probation and welfare officers look after the welfare of 5,000 offenders placed under their care. The salaries, wages and allowances for the prison service will cost the Irish taxpayer £119 million in 1999. Some prison officers will take home £45,000 in overtime alone. Salaries, wages and allowances for the probation service will cost £7.2 million. The results in terms of efficiency, efficacy and economy are there to be seen. Yet, the Minister continues to pour £118 million every year into the running costs of the prison system and to add another 1,000 prison spaces at a cost of £125 million to a system which is a proven failure. At the same time the probation and welfare service which is a proven success is starved of money and of personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1984 the Whitaker report on the penal system reported that &ldquo;a progressive strengthening of the service is essential for more effective and extensive use of alternatives to imprisonment&rdquo;. In November 1997 the Government set up an independent expert group to look into the probation and welfare service. The group's first report was published on 2 November 1998. Its main recommendation was &ldquo;that the number of basic rate probation and welfare officers be increased from 148.5 to 225 with appropriate increases in the <Col N="614" /> number of senior and clerical support&rdquo;. This would cost £2.5 million. It represents excellent value for money and is absolutely essential. Yet, the Government and the Minister have failed to make any allowance for this in the Estimates for the public service. The net result is that more than 600 prisoners who were released from prison into the care and supervision of the probation and welfare service are free. Surely this is farcical in view of the fact that supervision was a strict condition of their release? Nevertheless, they remain totally unsupervised.</P>
    <P>There are insufficient probation and welfare officers to deal with the rehabilitation of sex offenders and drug offenders in prison. The official neglect of both these categories borders on the criminal. The service is unable to cope with the demand from the courts for probation reports and has been unable, for the past number of years, to do any assessment reports for family law court cases.</P>
    <P>What is the point in setting up a review group and commissioning a report if the Minister disregards its main recommendation? Will the Minister tell the House the reason for his failure to make the crucial appointments so urgently recommended by the review group? Has he sought any financial assistance from the Minister for Finance? Is the Minister prepared to seek a Supplementary Estimate? This should present no problem. We recall that last year a Supplementary Estimate was introduced for Garda pay and overtime in the wake of the blue flu.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise that a strike is now imminent and is inevitable unless he moves now? The Minister must move. He must also move from the blinkered approach that has characterised his penal philosophy that incarceration takes precedence over rehabilitation. The Minister must see that there are viable, cost efficient and effective alternatives which work and which reduce re-offending. One of these &ndash; and a very important one &ndash; is the probation and welfare service. For far too long this service has been undervalued and under resourced. The moment of truth is at hand and the service is not prepared to play Cinderella any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for raising this matter. On 27 November 1997 I established an expert group to review the probation and welfare service with the following terms of reference. The expert group was to examine the role of the probation and welfare service having regard to recent and current developments, the needs of the service, in the context of its proper role, to deliver an effective and efficient service and the organisation and status of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first report of the group was published early in November 1998. It set out the present role of the probation and welfare service, the problems within the probation and welfare service and made a number of recommendations. The group recommended that the number of staff <Col N="615" /> serving be brought up to levels previously approved by Government decisions &ndash; this would have included the Government led by Deputy Higgins's party. This will mean an increase in the number of basic grade officers serving from 148.5 on 31 December 1997 to 225, with appropriate increases in the number of senior staff and clerical support. It recommended that the current system for the recruitment of staff be streamlined. The review group found that there is a need to invest in a comprehensive public information and awareness programme and recommended that funding be set aside for this purpose. The group also recommended that an invitation to tender for a new IT system issue immediately and a dedicated IT section be established within the probation and welfare service as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It was recommended that a comprehensive staff training needs analysis should be undertaken including an analysis of the training needs associated with the introduction of the new information technology system. It was also recommended that the recommendations of the ESRI in relation to research needs should be implemented as soon as possible. It was further recommended that the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Regulations, 1984 [Regulation 4(a)] which require groups participating in the community service order scheme to carry their own insurance be amended.</P>
    <P>In relation to staffing matters, there are 15 vacancies in the basic grade of permanent probation and welfare officer and the Civil Service Commission is currently recruiting staff to enable these posts to be filled in the first half of 1999. As regards the additional 65 probation and welfare officers and the ten other senior staff and clerical support staff recommended in the expert group's report, my Department is considering the recommendation made by the expert group in consultation with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In relation to providing a comprehensive public information and awareness programme, I am sure the Deputy would agree that much of the excellent work done by the probation and welfare service goes unnoticed and I will examine how best a public relations initiative can be progressed to promote knowledge about the current and future development of the service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> As regards an IT package for the service, it has been possible to make progress by putting in place local area networks in the probation and welfare offices. These are being installed at present and a considerable amount of computer hardware has been purchased. I hope that by the end of 1999 there will be a comprehensive information technology system in place. My Department will also implement a comprehensive training programme for the new IT system and take into account other additional training needs as they arise.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service has a small research unit and when the extra staff and the improved IT system are in place this will allow for the development of more detailed statistics and data.</P>
    <P>As regards to community service projects and related insurance issues, I am examining this whole area with a view to providing easier and more cost effective insurance cover for people doing community service work.</P>
    <P>In its first report the group also set out the parameters for the next report which is to include the future role and needs of the service, the service's role in relation to juvenile justice, family law and related children's issues, including adoption, drugs, pre-court, mediation and reparation, the necessary changes in legislation and the organisational status of the service. It is expected that the final report will be ready mid-1999.</P>
    <P>I trust that from what I outlined the Deputy will appreciate that far from having a blinkered view of the probation and welfare service I have been looking out onto the horizon for some time with a view to improving the service. I have been doing that ever since the Government in which he served rode off into the sunset.</P>
    <P>I want to inform the Deputy that last week I met IMPACT, the union representing the probation and welfare officers, to outline the current position and to assure them of my commitment to the service. It goes without saying that I would hardly have bothered to set up an expert group to examine the probation and welfare service unless I intended to bring about substantial improvements, which could have been brought about by the Government in which Deputy Higgins served as Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 3 March 1999.</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): The North-Eastern Health Board has carried out a preliminary investigation of an allegation that a member of staff at one of its hospitals had sought payment from a patient for a special orthopaedic support jacket to which the patient was entitled free of charge. The board has now referred the matter to the Garda for investigation and the employee involved has been placed on leave. I understand that the Garda investigation is continuing. It would not be appropriate for me to comment any further on the case.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the number of notifications to health boards under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, far exceeds the number of inspections; the average timescale in each health board area between notification and inspection; the steps, if any, he will take to address these delays; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, pre-schools are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first step in this process the health boards held public information meetings and carried out information campaigns to ensure that providers were made fully aware of the inspection process and the requirement to notity the boards. On receipt of a notification the health board inspection team is required to provide advice, guidance and support to the provider as necessary. This may involve a number of advisory visits. Where deficiencies are identified during a preliminary inspection, review visits are required to ensure that specific improvements are made. Additionally a significant volume of administrative work has to be completed by the inspection teams. Depending on the volume and the complexity of <Col N="618" /> the preparatory work the average time between notification and inspection varies somewhat.</P>
    <P>All health boards are, however, working towards having all first inspections of notified pre-school services in their area completed by the end of June 1999 as set out in the guidelines which accompany the regulations, and provision for this is included in their 1999 allocations.</P>

      <P>Doctors have a clear ethical obligation to safeguard their own health particularly where this may affect their ability to properly take care of their patients. Self-treatment and addiction to alcohol or drugs are recognised as posing particular threats to the health of doctors, and by extension, to the health of patients.</P>
      <P>By definition, inappropriate self-treatment by doctors is difficult to detect and monitor. The problem may be concealed even from colleagues and spouses. Many such cases are dealt with each year by the sick doctors committee. This is an <i>ad hoc </i>group of medical practitioners and representatives of the GP Wives Association which attempts to persuade doctors with such problems to step back from practice and seek treatment for their conditions. This scheme works very effectively and I would like to pay tribute to the dedicated group of doctors who have undertaken this work over the years.</P>
      <P>I have recently received a discussion paper from the Medical Council on the introduction of a more formal scheme to deal with health issues that come before the council. I will be meeting the council in the next few weeks to discuss this and other issues.</P>

      <P>Since taking office I have provided some £19.5 million to implement the provisions of the national cancer strategy. This is substantial funding, over and above the resources already being devoted to the provision of cancer services throughout the country. Among other issues, the funding is addressing regional imbalances in the <Col N="619" /> availability of cancer treatment services outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased with the progress made so far. Since implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced, I have provided for a total of 22 additional major consultant posts in the treatment and care of people with cancer. I have also provided funding for a range of important support staff, who have either taken up duty or are currently being recruited.</P>
      <P>The national cancer strategy was accompanied by an action plan which indicated how the provisions of the strategy would be implemented. The funding I have provided effectively delivers on that plan. There is of course, more to be done in the area of cancer, and I will be examining the scope for further funding in the context of the Estimates for 2000. The funding I have already given under the national cancer strategy is effectively a stand-alone budget for new developments in cancer services, in the sense that it must be directed to this area and cannot be used for other purposes.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the cost of certain drugs used in the treatment of cancer have been rising significantly. My Department is currently examining the extent of these increased costs and I will be taking this issue into account when framing the allocations for 2000 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The establishment of the social services inspectorate, which will concentrate for an initial three year period on child care services, is a priority for my Department. The remit of the inspectorate will be: (i) the inspection of health board residential homes for children under the Child Care Act, 1991; (ii) the monitoring of the organisation, operation and management of child care services; (iii) the eval<Col N="622" /> uation of the quality and responsiveness of services as experienced by users and carers with a view to improving standards; (iv) the provision of professional advice and expertise on the formulation, implementation and review of child care policy and the effective and efficient delivery of services; (v) the development strategies to give effect to recommendations of relevant inquiry and review reports, for example, the Madonna House inquiry, the Kelly Fitzgerald inquiry, the Kilkenny incest inquiry, the McColgan inquiry; (iv) such other additional tasks as may be assigned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, the overall issue of the availability of nurses is being kept under review by the Health Service Employers' Agency, HSEA. The HSEA established a task force in 1998 to examine the full nature of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>
      <P>A HSEA survey of Dublin hospitals showed 448 vacant staff nurse posts on 15 January 1999. However, a survey of the same hospitals carried out one week later by the Department revealed a significant reduction in the number of vacant posts &ndash; down to 384 on 22 January 1999. A further survey carried out during the week ending 5 February 1999 provided an almost identical result, 384.9 vacancies.</P>
      <P>This downward trend is consistent with the increase in the number of nurses applying to An Bord Altranais for registration. The returns indicate that there is a particular difficulty in recruiting nurses for specialist areas such as theatre, intensive care, coronary care, accident and emergency and paediatrics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> Health board and voluntary hospitals outside of the Dublin area have indicated that they have no difficulty in filling permanent nursing posts but occasional problems arise in recruiting temporary or locum staff to cover sick leave, annual leave and maternity leave.</P>
    <P>The survey returns reinforce the indications given to the HSEA by hospital management that nurses are leaving Dublin and taking up positions in rural areas. The cost of housing and traffic gridlock are seen as disincentives to taking up nursing posts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The strength of the economy is having an impact on the availability of nurses. Nurses have enhanced mobility by virtue of their education, training and skills. In the current economic boom, they are much sought after by pharmaceutical and related companies in the private health sector, as well as by commercial concerns in other sectors.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not in a unique position in relation to the shortage of nurses. The reality is that the United States, the United Kingdom and most other European countries are also experiencing a shortage of nursing personnel. Pay rates for staff nurses are higher here than in the United Kingdom and a number of other European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that An Bord Altranais reports an increase in the number of nurses applying for registration which would suggest that nurses are returning from abroad. In 1998, the board received 1,400 applications for registration from nurses abroad, compared with 939 in 1996. Conversely, the number of Irish nurses going abroad dropped from 1,079 in 1996 to 850 in 1998.</P>
    <P>Arising from the work of the task group, the HSEA outlined to the nursing unions in November 1998 a number of initiatives to address the shortage, including the standardisation of overtime rates and full incremental credit on permanent appointment for relevant previous nursing experience at home and abroad. This has been warmly welcomed by nursing unions as a constructive contribution towards helping resolve the problems of nursing shortages.</P>
    <P>The HSEA is committed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. The only options for permanent employment are full-time work or job-sharing. The absence of more flexible attendance patterns has been identified as a major obstacle to attracting nurses and midwives with family responsibilities back to work. The HSEA expects to be in a position to present a discussion document on a revised scheme of working arrangements to the nursing unions later this month. This initiative is being undertaken under the programme for partnership.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged a nurse researcher to specifically study nursing needs for the coming years and to carry out research on the reasons nurses are leaving their profession. When this research has been completed, my Depart<Col N="625" /> ment will be in a better position to further address the issue of nursing shortages.</P>
    <P>In relation to negotiations  with the nursing organsations, the Deputy will be aware that the Labour Court recently recommended significant improvements in existing allowances for nurses working in specialised areas and who hold special qualifications. The court accepted that there are grounds for improvements in the pay of ward sisters and higher grades to reflect the new roles proposed for those grades in the report of the Commission on Nursing and recommended that the parties enter into immediate discussions on implementation of that report. Those discussions are to be completed by 1 May 1999 at which stage the parties are to report back to the court.</P>
    <P>I announced on 10 February that the Government was prepared to accept these Labour Court recommendations. Discussions between the HSEA and the nursing unions began on 16 February and an intensive programme of talks was agreed. I regret the decision of the nursing alliance to withdraw on the first day of the scheduled programme on Thursday last.</P>
    <P>Management's position, as expressed by the HSEA, is that all the issues must be discussed before a composite proposal, including pay, in respect of all the middle and senior manager grades can be put to the nursing alliance. The management side is committed to making such a proposal by the end of March, which would allow a further month for discussions before both sides report back to the Labour Court by the 1 May deadline set by the court.</P>
    <P>In light of the difficulties that have arisen, the Labour Court called both parties to a hearing last Saturday. Following lengthy discussions with the parties, and in order to facilitate the process, the court has decided to appoint a chairman to preside over the negotiations.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>The continuing rise in the incidence of suicide and parasuicide and, in particular, reports of high levels of parasuicide among the homeless is a cause of considerable concern. The report of the national task force on suicide, which was published last year, put forward a national suicide prevention-reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A core recommendation of the task force was the establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards. The group's main responsibilities include the review of ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, the co-ordination of research into suicide and the making of recommendations to the chief executive officers of health boards which, it is hoped, will assist in the reversal of the growing incidence of suicide and parasuicide. The group was established last year by the chief executive officers of the health boards and has met on three occasions, most recently on Tuesday, 26 January 1999. Arising from the deliberations of the group so far, it is intended to appoint a full-time researcher-co-ordinator with secretarial facilities. I have provided the necessary funds to the group to allow this important work to proceed. The <Col N="628" /> research work to be undertaken by the group will, I hope, have a positive impact on the incidence of parasuicide among at risk groups, including the homeless.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department continues to work closely with a wide variety of statutory and voluntary groups to ensure people have the information and support to make healthy lifestyle choices. In order to increase the levels of knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with smoking and to reduce the number of people smoking, several national multi-media anti-smoking campaigns have been initiated over the last number of years. In late December last year, I launched the most recent of these. The campaign urges smokers to &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; and the advertisements have been featured in newspapers, on radio and outdoor sites. The campaign was developed in co-operation with the Irish Cancer Society and the eight regional health boards and an important element of this initiative is the support being made available to assist those attempting to quit smoking. Smokers were encouraged to telephone for a comprehensive stop smoking advice kit, free of charge. The kit includes tips for quitting smoking. For those seeking local assistance or counselling the kit contains contact numbers for health board support services and the stop smoking Quitline &ndash; a counselling phoneline being offered by the Irish Cancer Society.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has provided support for the development and delivery of training for general practitioners on smoking cessation interventions. This initiative is operated in partnership between the Irish College of General Practitioners and the health boards. This will add considerably to the support available on the ground to people who wish to stop smoking.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department co-ordinates two school programmes which seek to prevent young people taking up smoking. The smoking reduction action programme, SCRAP, is a peer-led anti-smoking programme for schools which was developed by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society, the National Youth Federation and with support from the Department of Education and Science. The Smoke-busters project, which is aimed at primary school children, seven to 11 years in an urban environment, was developed in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A voluntary code on smoking in the workplace was developed with the support of the Irish Con<Col N="629" /> gress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation and the Health and Safety Authority. The code is included in a booklet entitled &ldquo;Working Together for Cleaner Air&rdquo;, and was distributed to over 5,000 companies, State and Semi-State institutions in late 1994. This code encourages a consensual approach to smoking control policies through a consultation process between staff and management interests.</P>
    <P>Action against smoking continues at health board level and in the voluntary sector. The health promotion unit, in association with voluntary agencies active in this area, produces a range of materials, including leaflets and posters containing information on smoking and encouraging smokers to quit.</P>
    <P>In addition to health promotion and information measures, there is also in place a range of legislative provisions which include a range of measures to help curtail tobacco consumption. Environmental controls on smoking were strengthened and extended in 1996. Smoking is prohibited in many areas frequented by children, including schools, child care centres, pre-schools, crèches, playgroups, day nurseries and other services which cater for children. Smoking is also prohibited in public areas such as banks, building societies, barber shops, hairdressing salons, bowling alleys, bingo halls, bridge centres, hospitals, doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms, taxis and hackney cabs. New restrictions on smoking have been introduced in cafes, canteens, restaurants and snack bars providing for specified non-smoking areas.</P>
    <P>Shortly after I took office I established a smoke free policy group to carry out a fundamental review of all aspects of smoking and health policy, including legislation. I look forward to receiving the report of this group in the near future.</P>

      <P>In December 1997 the Government established a Cabinet committee to oversee the work of an inderdepartmental working group whose task it would be to prepare a Green Paper on abortion. Work on drafting the Green Paper is proceeding. The process involves consideration of the constitutional, legal, medical, moral, ethical and social issues which arise regarding abortion. When the drafting has been completed I intend to convene <Col N="630" /> another meeting of the Cabinet committee, when it will commence consideration of the draft. Publication of the Green Paper must await a final decision of the Government in due course. I acknowledge that the process is taking longer than expected but any dates given by me are at all times indicative, pending final approval by Government. It is the Government's intention to refer the Green Paper, when completed, to the all-party committee on the Constitution for consideration.</P>
      <P>The Office for National Statistics, London, has indicated to my Department that statistics on the number of abortions carried out in the calendar year 1998 are not yet available. Figures for the period 1 January to 30 September 1998 indicate that 4,473 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in that period. A total of 5,336 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in 1997.</P>
      <P>I have made an additional £1 million available to the health boards in 1999 for the further development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services. The health boards have been asked to concentrate this additional funding on measures aimed at reducing the rate of unplanned pregnancy in women aged between 15 and 34 years, as the majority of abortions performed on Irish women involve women in this age group.</P>

      <P>In January 1999 I received a letter from the chairman of the Beaumont Hospital board setting out his board's concern about the capacity of the hospital to meet the demand on services within available resources. The letter highlights in particular the following issues from the hospital's perspective: the shortage of step-down accommodation, the demands on the hospital's accident and emergency and dialysis services, the high level of health board referrals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since receipt of the chairman's letter, officials of my Department have met with the hospital in context of the annual service plan discussions and the above issues were discussed at length and a number of specific actions were agreed. In relation to the shortage of step-down accommodation, it was acknowledged that this was a widespread problem in the Dublin area. With this in mind, I have allocated £9 million in 1999 for the development of services at national level for older people, including the provision step-down facilities. This should free up acute beds for more <Col N="631" /> appropriate usage, particularly in the Dublin area. In relation to the hospital's high level of health board referrals, it was agreed that the hospital should review the appropriateness of its referrals from outside its catchment areas for routine procedures and take whatever remedial actions it deemed necessary in consultation with the relevant health agencies. In relation to the hospital's demand on accident and emergency and dialysis services, additional funding of the order of £800,000 has been availabe to the hospital in its 1999 letter of determination to meet service needs in this area. The Deputy will also wish to know that my Department approved additional capital and revenue funding totalling £4.306 million for Beaumont Hospital this year. I am confident that the above measures will greatly alleviate the hospital's service difficulties this year.</P>
    <P>At the hospital's service plan meeting with officials in February 1999, follow-up action involving the Department of Health and Children and the hospital was agreed on a range of issues over and above those identified above.

      <P>The decision that all childhood cases of leukaemia should be referred for initial assessment to the specialist paediatric oncology unit at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, was taken on the basis of best international practice. It arose from a recommendation to me from the National Cancer Forum, an expert body which advises me on the implementation of the national cancer strategy and related matters. The only change to current practice will be that newly diagnosed cases will be referred for initial assessment and treatment planning in Crumlin. This does not mean that all cases would necessarily have to be treated in Crumlin. After the initial assessment, subsequent treatment, including chemotherapy, may then be delivered in the child's most appropriate local hospital, on a clearly defined and agreed share care basis, subject to proper supervision.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Forum was established in March 1997 as part of the action plan to implement the national cancer strategy. Its purpose is to act as a focal point of communication and co-ordination and to act as a unifying link for planning and delivery of all levels of cancer services. Its terms of reference include advising the Minister for Health and Children on: progress in the implementation of the national cancer strategy; the evaluation of the effectiveness and quality of cancer services; the co-ordination of cancer services at national and regional level; best practice in cancer prevention, treatment and care; the development and implementation of protocols for the treatment and care of cancer patients; and the co-ordination of research into cancer, in conjunction with the Health Research Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the National Cancer Forum, which comprises some of the most eminent cancer specialists in the country, is fully capable of advising on issues relating to paediatric oncology. Where it requires additional advice on any issue, it can seek it from specialists in the relevant area. <Col N="633" /> In the case of this issue, the forum sought detailed submissions and advice both from clinicians in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin and the Adelaide and Meath hospitals, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght.</P>

They have indicated that they were concerned about the events as reported in the media and that they have investigated the matter. However, I understand the hospital authorities are reluctant to elaborate on the detail of the case as they do not want to breach the patient's right to confidentiality. They have advised my Department that normal procedures were followed in dealing with this case. They have further stated that they would meet with the patient to discuss the matter if she so desires and the patient has been advised to this effect.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the need for the provision of a comprehensive and integrated health service with a view to meeting the requirements of current and projected population and demographic trends; his views on the need for strategic investment in key areas in order to meet these requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The health strategy &ndash; Shaping a Healthier Future &ndash; reflects an acceptance of the benefits to be derived from strategic management in seeking to provide a comprehensive integrated health service to meet the current and projected needs of our population. The strategy sets health and social gain for patients at its core and specifically addresses the issue of creating better linkages between different aspects of the health services so that from the patient's point of view an integrated seamless service is received. The programme for Government &ndash; An Action Programme for the Millennium &ndash; further emphasises a strategic approach to our health services.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the way in which health service requirements can be affected by population trends, in particular by the ongoing increase in the percentage of older persons, the increase in recent years in the number of births and the increased life expectancy of persons with mental and physical disability. These population trends are a major consideration in my Department's planning of health service developments generally. In this regard an important exercise which will commence shortly will review services for older people and related hospital services.</P>
      <P>Service plans, which health boards are required to submit annually to me as Minister for Health and Children under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, provide an opportunity to review requirements across the range of health services. Reports of the directors of public health also serve to draw attention to population and other trends with implications for health and health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> In the context of the population trend and epidemiological data available to it and taking account of current knowledge on the most efficient and effective ways of addressing the health needs indicated by these, my Department is continuing its policy of strategic investment across a range of health service areas. These include services related to cancer and heart disease &ndash; two major causes of premature death in our society &ndash; services for older people and for persons with a physical and mental disability as well as investment to implement the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative. The 1999 revenue expenditure programme for my Department represents an investment increase of £300 million over the out-turn for the previous year amounting to a 10 per cent increase. In regard to capital investment, over the three year period, 1999-2001, this will be £525 million compared to the 1995-97 period when only £309 million was spent. The investment programme as a whole makes significant provision for the critical service areas and stands as a testament to my commitment to a strategic approach to managing our health service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>The development of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, is a continuing process and major development projects have been undertaken by the hospital since it opened in 1957. The expansion and upgrading of the operating theatre department forms part of an ongoing programme to develop the hospital as a major paediatric centre, providing a comprehensive range of services for children. This development is being accorded a high priority by the hospital and by my Department within the overall development programme.</P>
      <P>The theatre development proposed will enable the hospital to meet increased demand and future needs. A development brief has been prepared by the project team overseeing the development which provides for five new operating theatres, complete with ancillary accommodation, day surgery area and central sterile supplies department. It is proposed that these developments when commissioned will be followed by the upgrading of the existing theatre department to provide two further theatre suites. The next stage of the project involves the appointment of a design team to facilitate detailed planning of the proposed development. On completion of that phase tenders for construction will be sought.</P>
      <P>The estimated completion date for the development is 2002. However, the timing of the completion of planning and tendering, and the commencement and completion of construction for the development will depend on several variable factors which are difficult to assess accurately in advance. It is not possible for me, therefore, to give a precise timetable for the project.</P>
      <P>The staff required to enable the theatres to be commissioned is under ongoing consideration by hospital management and the recruitment process for any additional staff required will proceed in tandem with the pace of the development to ensure that no delays will arise in commissioning the theatres when their construction and equipping has been completed.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that there has been any delay in advancing this project. I am committed to the improvement of paediatric and, indeed, adult cardiac services in this country, and I anticipate that significant progress will continue to be made in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the waiting times for paediatric cardiac surgery, at 31 December 1998, the latest date for which figures are available, the number <Col N="639" /> of public patients on the cardiac surgery waiting list at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children was 77. This compares with a figure of 97 who were awaiting cardiac surgery at the 31 December 1997 and represents a reduction of almost 25 per cent on that year.</P>
    <P>Of the 73 patients awaiting cardiac surgery, 16 are awaiting between three and six months and 57 are waiting over six months. In relation to a gender breakdown of the list there are 57 females and 16 males awaiting cardiac surgery. The ages of children awaiting such surgery ranges from under one year to 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the proposed development of the theatres at the hospital will make a significant contribution to reduced waiting times and will facilitate an increase in the number of cardiac procedures performed at this hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>All medical and dental practitioners employed in the health service are obliged, as a condition of their employment, to indemnify themselves against claims for negligence. Indemnity normally gives the individual unlimited cover for claims made against them arising out of their work for public hospitals, from their private practice or from good Samaritan acts. Indemnity is normally taken out through membership of one of the two medical defence organisations which operate in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Since 1992, non-consultant hospital doctors, public health doctors, dentists employed by health boards and some other small groups of salaried doctors have been covered by a group medical indemnity scheme. The scheme was originally conceived as a measure to deal with industrial relations unrest among NCHDs who were dissatisfied with the then existing reimbursement scheme. On the basis that these groups are salaried doctors and dentists with little or no private practice it was decided to remove from them the obligation to hold individual indemnity cover and to devise a group scheme to purchase cover for them.</P>
      <P>The medical indemnity scheme was never intended to replicate the indemnity cover being provided by the medical defence organisations. Rather, it provides indemnity for the financial consequnces of negligence arising from work undertaken as part of the doctor/dentists' activities in a post approved by the Department of Health and Children in the public health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> In the years since 1992 the scheme has been amended to deal with problems arising during that period. Originally it did not provide representation at coroner's inquests. This has now been included. It was further amended in 1997 to remove ambiguities relating to cover for needlestick injuries caused to persons other than patients. The medical indemnity scheme does not provide cover for representation before the Fitness to Practice Committee of the Medical Council. It may, in certain circumstances, provide representation in other disciplinary proceedings. The Department is strongly of the view that an employer would not be put in the position of paying for services such as this. It would not be in the interests of hospitals or doctors that they should do so as, in certain circumstances, the hospital may be the body initiating a complaint against a doctor. It is in the doctor's own interest that he or she has a source of independent professional advice and representation. NCHDs should also be aware that they expose themselves  to risk when they diagnose, treat or prescribe for a relative or friend. They need to provide themselves with appropriate cover for this area of practice.</P>
    <P>In 1992 both the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation emphasised the importance of NCHDs and others covered by the scheme taking out supplementary cover for those aspects of their professional lives not covered by the scheme. This is available from the Medical Defence Union, Medical Protection Society and St. Paul.</P>
    <P>I therefore, do not accept that there are loopholes in the scheme given its express purpose. In any event the operation of the scheme is kept under regular review.</P>

Discussions with clinical staff are ongoing to resolve a range of medical issues associated with the expansion of the service in the first instance before the expansion of the service can take place.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Southern Health Board that in line with these discussions certain proposals have been made and these are now being examined by the board. A further meeting is being planned over the coming weeks. I have asked the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board to keep the Deputy informed directly on the progress of these discussions.</P>

      <P>The 1999 service plan recently submitted by Tallaght Hospital outlines the services it plans to provide in 1999. The plan aims to consolidate services transferred from the base hospital to Tallaght in June 1998 and to maintain activity at the levels prevailing in November and December 1998.</P>
      <P>In relation to job cutbacks the plan &ndash; excluding commissioning staff &ndash; reflects a reduction of 25 posts, which will be achieved through the completion of temporary contracts in the period to 30 June 1999.</P>
      <P>The plan highlights the fact that the hospital will not now be bringing on stream its planned private and semi-private facilities until next year and will, therefore, continue to be approximately 75 beds short of the bed complement it had in the base hospitals. This is the reason for some reduction in services. The plan acknowledges that some services have been hit by the bed reduction, particularly elective orthopaedics with a 25 per cent fall in activity in the second half of the year compared to the output at the base hospitals and urology with a 10 per cent fall in activity.</P>
      <P>The hospital had an overall occupancy from August through to December 1998 of 94 per cent. As projections for 1999 are based significantly on this period, I would envisage the hospital operating at somewhat similar capacity to the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>The general medical services scheme provides, amongst other services, prescribed drugs and medicines free of charge to persons who would be unable to provide these items for themselves without suffering undue hardship. A comprehensive range of the most modern prescription therapies are available under the scheme when prescribed by the patient's general practitioner. In order for a product to be included in the scheme, it must satisfy a number of criteria. The criteria states that the product must be such that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and that the product should not be advertised or promoted to the public.</P>
      <P>Nicotine replacement therapies belong to a category of products that do not satisfy these criteria, in that they are generally available over-the-counter, and most are advertised directly to the public. Accordingly, they are not included in the list of items reimbursable under the general medical services scheme.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the Department's health promotion unit has recently conducted a national multi-media anti-smoking campaign to encourage smokers to give up and non-smokers to refrain from taking up the habit. The campaign, which was launched on 1 January 1999, was entitled &ldquo;Break the Habit for Good&rdquo; and was developed in co-operation with the Irish Cancer Society and the eight regional health boards. An important element of this initiative is the support being made available to assist those attempting to quit smoking.</P>
      <P>In addition, as part of the campaign the Irish College of General Practitioners are working with the health boards with a view to training general practitioners on smoking cessation interventions. This will add considerably to the support available on the ground to people who wish to stop smoking.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any one month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 July 1999, the existing drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes will be merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit or individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition such as Alzheimer's disease, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card. In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a <Col N="644" /> personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>

      <P>In the 1997 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, published in November 1998, the inspector highlighted the poor conditions that exist in some wards located in the old, large, Victorian-style hospitals which are unsuitable for in-patient care of psychiatric patients. However, as these wards are closed and more community-based alternatives are provided, steady progress is being made towards improving the quality of mental health care in this country.</P>
      <P>In his 1997 report, the inspector pointed out that the rate of progress in upgrading unsatisfactory accommodation or providing alternative community residential accommodation, as well as the development of acute units in general hospitals, has been dictated by the availability of capital funding. In order to address this problem, £7 million was provided in capital funds in 1998 which will accelerate the provision of acute psychiatric units in general hospitals. For example, I have included provision for units at Portlaoise, Kilkenny, Sligo, Nenagh, Ennis, St. Vincent's, Elm Park and Beaumont Hospital in the capital programme. Capital funds have also been made available for the provision of additional community-based facilities throughout the country including facilities for older people with mental health problems.</P>
      <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has, over the past decade, played a crucial role in raising standards in the mental health services in this country. I acknowledge the influence of the inspector and his team in improving the quality of our mental health services and in the promotion of good practice. The improvements achieved in 1997 are documented in the report and while these improvements are welcome, I fully acknowledge that much remains to be done to improve both physical facilities and services within the mental health sector. It is my intention to continue with the initiatives I started in 1998 in order to improve the rate of progress in providing a modern mental health service.</P>

    <P>The chapter in the report entitled Industry Changes claims that &ldquo;Ireland has a low healthcare spend as a percentage of GDP at 7 per cent in comparison to an EU average of 8 per cent&rdquo;. Comparisons of health spending as a percentage of GDP are notoriously difficult given that GDP is growing at a uniquely fast rate in Ireland. The following table, which is based on the latest comparable available statistics published by the OECD, compares Irish health expenditure with the average for EU and OECD countries. The figures relate to 1996 and include both capital and current expenditure. Figures are shown for total expenditure, which is made up of both public and private expenditure, and public expenditure taken on its own. Health spending is expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product and also shown is spending per head of <Col N="646" /> population which is compared using US dollar purchasing power parities.</P>

    <P>Source: OECD, 1996.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>However, some caution should be used in the interpretation and analysis of these figures. Health systems deliver very different services in different countries and this is likely to influence the figures despite the fact that the OECD makes every effort to take this into consideration. In addition, the demands of the public vary between countries with, for example, continental systems having to deal with much higher proportions of their populations in older age groups. Also Ireland is only now beginning to catch up with our EU partners in terms of national income and this means that these countries have had greater resources to build up services over a long number of years. The OECD in its economic survey of Ireland published in 1997 compiled a special report on the health services. The report noted that there had been major increases in spending on community services and that there had been significant improvements in hospital productivity in recent years. The report concluded that the Irish health system, based on a mixture of public and private care, resulted in good provision of health care at a relatively low cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In response to the Deputy's second point regarding possible EU restrictions, I want to emphasise that this Government will continue to invest in the development of our health services while at all times respecting the terms of the stability and growth pact as agreed in the Dublin European Council. This commitment is clearly demonstrated in the 1999 original health estimate which when compared with the provisional 1998 outturn shows an increase of 10 per cent, one of the largest increases in many years. This level of funding has been provided against a background of careful management of overall public finances. If the level of increased investment by this Government is sustained, I would expect that our relative position in regard to OECD as we move into the next millennium will be more favourable.</P>

      <P>Regulation 258/97 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients came into force in all member states on May 15 1997. Foods and food ingredients which have not been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community as of May 15 1997, fall within the scope of this regulation. The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients intended for human consumption, including <i>inter alia</i> genetically modified food, must undergo a safety assessment and be officially authorised before being placed on the European market. It also contains provisions in certain instances for the labelling of novel foods and food ingredients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is the competent authority for this regulation in Ireland. The assessment of applications made under the novel food regulations is carried out by the Food Safety Auth<Col N="648" /> ority of Ireland's GMO and novel foods sub-committee. To date, no application under the novel foods regulation has been made in Ireland but, the GMO and novel foods sub-committee has commented on applications that have been submitted by other member states. However, no application has, to date, been approved for placing on the market for human consumption in the EU.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has responsibility for Directive 90/220 on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. This directive covers the environmental risk assessment and release approval of all GMOs through both the research and development stage &ndash; so called field trials &ndash; as well as the placing of products containing GMOs on the market. The Environmental Protection Agency enforces this directive on behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Prior to the coming into force of Regulation 258/97, I understand that a Novartis maize containing a kanamycin resistant marker gene was authorised for human consumption under Directive 90/220.</P>
    <P>Since Regulation 258/97 came into effect, no product can be placed on the market for human consumption without being assessed and approved under it.</P>
    <P>The GMO sub-committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland advises me on issues relating to the genetic modification of foodstuffs and affords a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food. This committee has discussed the use of this kanamycin resistant gene and considers, in line with international scientific opinion, that this antibiotic is no longer clinically significant in human or veterinary medicine and considers the risk associated with the use of this marker gene to be vanishingly low to both the environment and to human health.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> I am considering the establishment of a children's ombudsman in this context. The Deputy will appreciate that the appointment of an ombudsman for children has implications for a number of Departments dealing with issues relating to children and it will be necessary to clarify departmental roles and responsibilities before the issue can be progressed. For this reason no proposals have yet been brought to Cabinet.</P>

      <Quest>the facilities which exist in Ireland for the diagnosis and treatment of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Hypermobility syndrome; the number of patients who suffer from these conditions; the research, if any, being undertaken on these syndromes; the hospitals which provide treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ehlers-Danlos and Hypermobility syndromes are a heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterised by articular hypermobility, skin extensibility and tissue fragility. These conditions affect many parts of the body including the skin, joints, blood vessels, heart and bones. Patients with these conditions may require attention from various specialists including paediatricians, general physicians, dermatologists, cardiologists, geneticists, rheumatologists, orthopaedic and other surgeons.</P>
      <P>Treatment for patients with such syndromes is dependant on their individual needs and may be provided by a wide range of consultants. In some instances the identification of such syndromes is part of a secondary diagnosis or condition and treatment for such patients is centred around their primary condition. It is therefore difficult to privide a precise number of patients who suffer from these syndromes.</P>
      <P>The hospital inpatient inquiry system in my Department records information on hospitalisation in all acute publicly funded hospitals. The most recent year for which data is complete is 1997 and this indicates 18 hospital discharges recording a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and 171 discharges recording a diagnosis of Hypermobility syndrome. These patients were seen in hospitals throughout the country. It should be noted that if patients are admitted more than once in a given year for some condition, each attendance will be counted separately in HIPE.</P>
      <P>There is no research being undertaken in this country into these disorders but I have been informed by the National Centre for Medical Genetics that research into these disorders is being undertaken in Canada and Wales.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding labelling regulations for genetically modified foods; and if he has raised this important issue with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union, supported by member states, has developed legislation in relation to the labelling of genetically modified foodstuffs. The purpose of measures taken by the European Union on the labelling of such food is to give consumers clear, neutral and scientifically sound information on products derived from a genetically modified source.</P>
      <P>My Department is the competent authority in Ireland for EU legislation pertaining to the genetic modification of foodstuffs intended for human consumption. There are two EU regulaions in this regard.</P>
      <P>Regulation No. 258 of 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients came into force in all member states on 15 May 1997. The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, including genetically modified foods, must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved and authorised before being placed on the European market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labelling should make it possible for consumers to make choices and the novel foods regulation states that there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic or food property &ndash; for example, composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects and/or intended use of the food &ndash; which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. There must also be specific labelling to advise the consumer of the presence in the novel food or novel food ingredient of: material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population; material which is <Col N="651" /> not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which gives rise to ethical concerns; or an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification.</P>
    <P>I should also state that these labelling requirements for novel foods as prescribed by the novel foods regulation are additional to the general food labelling provisions which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The labelling and other provisions of Regulation No. 258/97 as outlined above do not apply to foods or food ingredients which were used for human consumption to a significant degree within the Community before the entry into force of the regulation and, therefore, not considered to be novel. To address consumer concerns in this regard, the Commission published Regulation No. 1139 of 1998 concerning the labelling of certain foodstuffs produced from genetically modified organisms. This regulation came into effect on 1 September 1998 and ensures that the same labelling rules for the information of the final consumer apply to foods and food ingredients consisting of, or derived from, GMOs which were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation No. 258/97.</P>
    <P>The regulation applies to foods and food ingredients which are produced, in whole or in part, from: Monsanto genetically modified soya beans and Novartis genetically modified maize.</P>
    <P>The regulation lays down additional labelling requirements for these products. Such labelling ensures that the final consumer is informed of any characteristic or food property, such as composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects or the intended use of the food, which renders a food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.</P>
    <P>In essence, if genetically modified protein or DNA is present in a foodstuff, then that foodstuff is subject to the additional labelling requirements.</P>
    <P>The controls as outlined provide protection to consumers and I wish to assure the Deputy that I am keeping the matter under continuing review to ensure that this continues to be the case. I am aware that consumers wish to be in a position whereby they can decide whether or not they want to consume products either containing genetically modified material or produced using genetic modification techniques, and I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to urge for maximum transparency on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland's scien<Col N="652" /> tific committee has established a GMO and novel foods sub-committee which advises my Department on issues in relation to the genetic modification of foodstuffs. This sub-committee also affords a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food.</P>
    <P>My Department is in on-going consultation with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to ensure that consumers are informed to the greatest degree possible in relation to the genetic modification of foodstuffs.</P>

      <P>I launched The Millennium Entrepreneur Fund, on Friday, 26 June 1998. The fund is a £1 million Enterprise Ireland-led initiative to encourage overseas based Irish technologists to establish new enterprises back in Ireland. The new fund is jointly sponsored by LM Ericsson; Bank of Ireland; industrialist Neil McCann and Enterprise Ireland, with 50 per cent finance being provided by the EU through Enterprise Ireland under the Seed and Venture Capital Measure of the Operational Programme 1994-99.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the fund is to provide early stage risk seed capital funding to highly skilled individuals or teams with strong international experience; an identified technology based high growth potential business focused primarily on export markets; entrepreneurial drive and amibtion who are willing to set up a business either in a manufacturing sector or in an internationally traded service sector; and at least one team member currently resident overseas, but willing to return to Ireland to set up in either a manufacturing sector or an internationally traded service sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that this fund does not provide grant aid. The fund provides early stage equity finance up to a maximum of IR£100,000. Applicatons are invited from individuals or teams, up to a maximum of three individuals, with third level degree qualifications or equivalent <Col N="655" /> training/experience involving a key Irish national who is relocating to Ireland with strong achievement in careers to date in an international business environment and with industrial experience in the specific industry/service sector.</P>
    <P>The business must be technologically based with high growth potential. The enterprise has to be set up and based in Ireland.</P>
    <P>No approvals have been made to date. While the fund has been promoted internationally since the announcement, the legal structures setting up the fund were only finalised in January 1999. It is planned that these investments will be made within a three year period. One hundred inquiries have been received to date and a number of formal applications are currently being considered and evaluated for presentation to the board of the millennium fund.</P>
    <P>The goal of the fund, which is managed by Enterprise Ireland, is to assist ten new high potential start-ups.</P>
    <P>In addition to seed funding, the Millennium Entrepreneur Fund will assign a company mentor and a patron company to offer advice and support to the new start up businesses. The mentor will typically be an experienced business strategist with expertise in developing high potential start-up companies. The patron company will be a successful Irish company, some of whose senior managers will be designated to offer practical advice and guidance to the start up.</P>
    <P>The full range of Enterprise Ireland services and programmes are available to the entrepreneur.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 1995 is to protect workers at work from accidents, fatalities and ill health. The legislation does not specifically relate to special areas of conservation.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the statutory body responsible for the day to day promotion of occupational health and safety and the enforcement of the above legislation. If the Deputy is concerned that certain aspects of the health and safety legislation in the context of the specific issue raised in his question are being breached, then he should bring the matter to the attention of the Health and Safety Authority at 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2, Tel. 6147000.</P>

It was among the first group of 14 LES areas and the service has subsequently been extended to a further eleven areas. Since its inception, the Tallaght LES has <Col N="657" /> developed at a steady pace and has become a very valuable service for the unemployed in the Tallaght area. It currently operates from two local employment centres &ndash; Tallaght Village and Brookfield &ndash; and six contact points &ndash; Fettercairn, Jobstown, Ballycragh, Killinarden, Avonbeg, Kilnamanagh.</P>
      <P>Since November 1995, the Tallaght LES has contacted a total of 3,816 people and 2,045 clients have formally registered for mediation services with the LES. These registrations can be broken down into the following categories:</P>

    <P>The census of April 1996 showed that there were 5,500 unemployed people living in the Tallaght Partnership area. As of 19 February 1999 there was a total of 4,570 people receiving UA or UB at Tallaght Social Welfare Office. These figures provide a context against which the LES registrations can be viewed. The 2,045 LES registered clients would not necessarily be a sub-set of the total currently unemployed in Tallaght, as measured by the live register. Also, the catchment area covered by the Tallaght LES may not be exactly coterminous with that covered by the Tallaght Social Welfare Office. Therefore, it would not be meaningful to express the LES comulative caseload as a percentage of the current live register in the area.</P>

      <P>The Council of Europe Social Charter which was adopted in 1961 was ratified by Ireland in 1964. Ireland reports on an annual basis on its compliance with the provisions of the charter which it has accepted. This report is examined in the first instance by the Committee of Independent Experts which examine it from a strictly legal point of view. The conclusions of that committee are then forwarded to the Governmental Committee which, in turn, in submitting proposals to the Committee of Ministers for a recommendation or any other action, takes into account social, economic and other policy considerations.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Ministers has indicated difficulties in our compliance with some aspects of certain provisions of the charter such as Article 4 &ndash; the Right to Fair Remuneration and Articles 5 and 6 &ndash; the Right to Organise and the Right to Bargain Collectively. Ireland maintains that our laws in these areas are justified and, in strict terms, are not in contravention of the charter. The concerns of the Committee of Ministers on these and all other provisions have been replied to in Ireland's recent reports on the implementation of the charter.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that, following a decision taken by a ministerial conference held in Turin in October 1991 to update and adapt the charter in order to take account of the social changes which occurred since the text was adopted in 1961, a revised social charter was drawn up and opened for signature in May 1996. Ireland will shortly examine again the text of the revised charter with a view to its acceptance.</P>

      <P>Allegations that Ronald Weisz was declared a bankrupt in New York State in 1994 and has a conviction in the United States for fraud were recently made to our Department. Section 183 of the Companies Act, 1963, as amended, prohibits an undischarged bankrupt from acting as a director of a company. As the bankruptcy was allegedly declared in a foreign state, legal advice was sought on the issue of jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised that a person declared a bankrupt in the US and remaining undischarged would not be in breach of section 183 by acting as a director in this jurisdiction by virtue of the definition of undischarged bankrupt as prescribed by section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963. I am also advised that the Irish courts do not necess<Col N="661" /> arily recognise a foreign bankruptcy with the possible exception of, <i>inter alia</i>, a bankruptcy in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>It is also alleged that Ronald Weisz was a directory of ABC Racquetball Courts Inc. a company incorporated in the USA, and thus is in breach of the Companies Acts for failing to list details of other directorships on the companies annual returns filed with the CRO. The Department does not currently have any substantive proof that Mr. Weisz was a director of this company.</P>

      <P>The decision to license the cultivation of oysters and clams on two specific sites, measuring 4.3 hectares in all, in Gweebarra Bay, County Donegal followed public consultation and consultation with statutory organisations including Bord Fáilte which had no comments to offer and Dúchas, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which confirmed it had no objection to the proposed aquaculture from a nature conservation point of view. Both Donegal County Council and the Northern Regional Fisheries Board indicated they had no objection.</P>
      <P>The licensing decision was published in the <i>Donegal Democrat </i>on 14 January 1999 to meet the requirements of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, (No. 23), so as to allow the applicant and any other interested person to appeal that decision to the independent statutory Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board established under that Act. As an appeal has been duly made to the board against that decision I am unable to comment on the decision.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture licensing arrangements now in place require public advertisement and formal consultation with specified statutory organisations, including those referred to, on all licence applications. Licensing decisions are governed in particular by section 61 of the 1997 Act, which specifies key factors to be taken into account in the decision-making process, including existing and potential alternative beneficial uses of the areas concerned, the likely ecological and environmental effects of the proposed aquaculture, as well as the likely impacts on the economy and heritage value of those areas.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities within the constraints of EU legislation. I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and indeed Irish suppliers of goods and services must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>In that context my Department is facilitating discussions between representatives of the Irish Offshore Operators Association, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Offshore Suppliers Association on the utilisation of Irish resources and services in the offshore petroleum industry. These discussions are ongoing. I am anxious that Irish involvement be increased and sustained over the longer term.</P>
      <P>There are, however, no powers available to require undertakings in regard to jobs or the provision of services with the oil companies involved in offshore exploration activities. Responsibility as regards employment of workers and indeed the provision of services and related issues are strictly matters for the exploration companies and their contractors. There are no powers available to oblige operators engaged in exploration activities in the Irish offshore to use Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services. The imposition of such conditions on licence holders is precluded under EU regulations.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that Enterprise Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has responsibility for ensuring maximum input of Irish industry in offshore exploration activities. They have been very active in this area for some time and have assisted the operators in identifying Irish companies who can tender for work and have assisted companies by identifying opportunities that are arising in both petroleum exploration and production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously outlined my concerns about fishermen who operate out of smaller inshore boats, dependent on catches of whitefish for their regular income. These are the most vulnerable people in the fishing communities as they are most affected by weather conditions. My priority in recent weeks was to devise a structured response that will protect the livelihoods of such fishermen during periods when they are unable <Col N="666" /> to fish and have very low incomes, given that EU state aid rules for the fishing industry rule out aid packages for income loss due to periods of bad weather.</P>
      <P>Following my detailed discussions with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the agreement of Government was secured to the introduction of a new scheme to be known as &ldquo;Fishing Assist&rdquo; which will benefit low income self employed fishermen. The legislative basis for the scheme is provided in the Social Welfare Bill, which was published last week.</P>
      <P>The new scheme includes changes to the income support arrangements for fishermen as follows: 80 per cent of all income from self employment will be assessed, rather than 100 per cent as has been the case heretofore; child related income disregards of £100 per annum for the first two qualified children and £200 per annum for the third and subsequent children; and relaxation of &ldquo;signing on&rdquo; arrangements.</P>
      <P>It is expected that over 500 low-income self-employed fishermen will benefit from the Fishing Assist measure which will cost up to £1 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>This scheme provides a structured response to a long-term problem and tackles the situation of low income fishermen in the whitefish and inshore fleets who are particularly vulnerable to prolonged periods of bad weather which interfere with fishing activities.</P>
      <P>I have also established a working group, comprising fishing representatives, my Department and BIM, to review and advise on the extent of short-term weather related difficulties in the fishing industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware section 54 of the Harbours Act, 1996 provided for the appointment to both of these port companies of constables formerly employed by the predecessor bodies of <Col N="667" /> those companies. The responsibility for policing the jurisdictional areas of both port companies is a matter for the companies themselves.</P>
    <P>I have instigated a general review of the operation of the 1996 Harbours Act, in conjunction with the Irish Ports Association and the port companies. The intention is to establish whether the legal framework under which the major State ports operate, is constraining in any way their ability to deliver on their commercial mandate both now and in the future. We need to be satisfied that port managements at the nine commercial State port companies are not being organisationally constrained by the present legal framework and also that private sector involvement and investment is not discouraged by it.</P>

      <P>Meetings between the Foreign Ministers of the European Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are normally held every two years. The next such meeting is scheduled to be held in Berlin on 30 March.</P>
      <P>The EU Common Position on Burma was adopted during the Irish Presidency of the EU in October 1996 in response to the serious human rights abuses which were seen to be taking place in that country. The Common Position has been renewed every six months since then and was strengthened and extended at its most recent renewal by the General Affairs Council last October. Among other things, the Common Position places restrictions on the issue of visas by EU countries to senior members of the current regime in Rangoon.</P>
      <P>In July 1997, Burma and Laos were accepted as full member states of ASEAN. As a result, Burma now expects to participtate in all formal EU-ASEAN encounters, including the Foreign Ministers meeting scheduled to be held in Berlin next month. However, the Burmese Foreign Minister, Win Aung, is included in the list of those covered by the EU visa ban and will not therefore be granted a visa by the German authorities to attend the meeting unless all EU partners agree to a waiver of the ban. Ireland is among those who believe that the Common Position should be respected and upheld in this instance.</P>
      <P>At this point in time, it seems unlikely that agreement will be reached among partners to grant the Burmese Foreign Minister a visa. Should that prove to be the case, it is understood that the ASEAN side will refuse to attend the Berlin meeting which will accordingly have to be either cancelled or postponed.</P>

      <P>The Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Bill passed the United States House of Representatives and Senate by unanimous consent and was signed into law by President Clinton on 30 Octover 1998. The Act amends US immigration law to insert a new visa programme called the Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training (Q-2) Visa Programme. This programme will allow 4,000 people a year aged 35 or under and having residence in Northern Ireland or the six Border counties to come to the US for a period of not more than three years for the purpose of developing job skills and conflict resolution abilities. The new legislation is substantially the same as that proposed by the New York-based Irish Immigration Reform Movement, with a downward adjustment in the number of visas available and the length of stay allowed. The only substantial amendment was the dropping of a waiver that would have allowed un-documented Irish people already in the US to benefit from the programme.</P>
      <P>The legislation provided for the programme to be approved by both the Attorney General (the Immigration and Naturalisation Service) and the Secretary of State. The consultation process is well under way and will have to be completed before the programme can be put in place and applications can be accepted. It is expected that this process will take some more months to complete. The Embassy in Washington will continue closely to monitor progress.</P>

      <P>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was signed by Ireland on 1 October 1973 and ratified on 8 December 1989. Upon ratification, Ireland made reservations to Articles 6(5), 10(2), 14, 19(2), 20(1) and 23(4). The reservation entered to Article 6(5), regarding the death penalty, was withdrawn.</P>
      <P>On 24 August 1998, Ireland transmitted notification of the withdrawal of the reservation to Article 14(6) and the reservation to Article 23(4) of the Covenant to the Secretary General of the United Nations. The enactment of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993, which makes legislative provision for compensation of miscarriages of justice, rendered Ireland's reservation to Article 14(6) of the covenant, which provides that such compensation may be made by administrative rather that legal means, unnecessary.</P>

      <P>Ireland maintains the following reservations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: The reservation to Article 10(2) states: Ireland accepts the principles referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 10 and implements them so far as practically possible. It reserves the right to regard full implementation of these principles as objectives to be achieved progressively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Reservation to Article 14 states: Ireland reserves the right to have minor offences against <Col N="671" /> military law dealt with summarily in accordance with current procedures which may not, in all respects, conform to the requirements of Article 14 of the Covenant.</P>
    <P>The Reservation to Article 19 paragraph 2, states: Ireland reserves the right to confer a monopoly on or to require the licensing of broadcasting enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Reservation of Article 20, paragraph 1, states: Ireland accepts the principle in paragraph 1 of Article 20 and implements it as far as it is practicable. Having regard to the difficulties in formulating a specific offence capable of adjudication at national level in such a form as to reflect the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations as well as the right to freedom of expression, Ireland reserves the right to postpone consideration of the possibility of introducing some legislative addition to, or variation of, existing law until such time as it may consider that such is necessary for the attainment of the objective of paragraph 1 of Article 20.</P>

      <P>Ireland has signed but has not ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The enactment of two pieces of domestic legislation is necessary before Ireland can ratify the Convention. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, dealing with discrimination in the workplace was enacted in June 1998. Preparations continue at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with regard to the second piece of legislation, the revised equal status legislation, which will outlaw discrimination in non-employment areas. It is hoped that the revised Equal Status Bill will be published before the end of the Dáil's Easter recess.</P>

      <P>Protocol No. 7 to the European Convention on <Col N="672" /> Human Rights was opened for signature on 22 November 1984 and was signed by Ireland on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The rights elaborated by the Protocol are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the Department of Health and Children; and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The Department of Foreign Affairs plays a co-ordinating role.</P>
      <P>A number of the rights elaborated by the Protocol are also reflected in the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Ireland is a Party. In particular, Article 1 of the Protocol &ndash; the right of a lawfully resident alien not to be expelled except in accordance with law &ndash; reflects the language contained in Article 13 of the Covenant. Similarly, Article 4 of the Protocol &ndash; the right of a person not to be tried or punished a second time for an offence for which they have already been convicted or acquitted. &ndash; and Article 5 of the Protocol &ndash; equality of rights as between spouses &ndash; correspond to Articles 14(7) and 23(4) respectively of the Covenant.</P>
      <P>The question of ratification has been considered by the Government Departments concerned over recent months so as to take full account of the substantive legislative changes and other legal developments which have taken place in the relevant areas since signature of the Protocol in 1984. Those complex issues involve, for example, matters relating to the expulsion of lawfully resident aliens and equality as between spouses following marital breakdown.</P>
      <P>The matter is far advanced. However, further consideration is required in order to establish, in particular, whether a recent decision by the Supreme Court pertaining to deportation proceedings has implications as regards Article 1 of the Protocol.</P>

      <P>Ireland proposes to become a party to both the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, done at Vienna on 23 May 1969 and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organisations or between International Organisations, done at Vienna on 21 March 1986. Before the State can become a party to the Conventions, further consideration of their terms will be necessary due to their complexity and no date has been set by which Ireland will become a party to them. Many provisions of both Conventions are replicated in customary international law and are thus applicable to Ireland in its treaty relations with other states and with international organisations. I am satisfied that while it is desirable that Ireland should in due course become party to the Conventions, our internationals relations are not adversely affected by the fact that we are not party to them at present.</P>

      <P>Ireland, along with the other member states of the United Nations, is a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice. Bearing in mind the important role which the court can play in resolving international disputes, and bearing in mind also Ireland's commitment under Article 29.2 of the Constitution to the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the question arises <Col N="676" /> whether Ireland should make a declaration under Article 36(2) of the Statute of the Court, accepting the court's compulsory jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Government is favourably disposed towards accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the court now that a method has been found for regulating and resolving the sovereignty dispute over Northern Ireland. The modalities of making the necessary declaration are being reviewed. It should be borne in mind, in any case, that the absence of such a declaration does not preclude disputes from being submitted to the court in appropriate cases, arising out of either a specific agreement between the parties or pursuant to treaty obligations. It should also be borne in mind that other forms of dispute settlement may be more suitable in certain cases.</P>

The committee, in its concluding comments and recommendations, expressed satisfaction with the high quality of the report and the constructive dialogue it had with the high level delegation, led by the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The Human Rights Committee raised eight principal subjects of concern in relation to Ireland's first report under the Covenant. These include: the legal status of the Convention under Irish law; the provisions of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976; the regulation of law enforcement officials, the adequacy of our legal aid schemes; the issue of imprisonment for non-payment of debts and imprisonment of juveniles; freedom of information legislation including the availability of information on abortion; the provision of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act; the absence of divorce legislation and the legal status of non-nationals. Many of these issues have been addressed by legislative and constitutional means over the past five years including; the ending of the National Emergency on 16 February 1995, the constitutional referendums on abortion information and divorce and the rescinding of the Ministerial Order made under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act.</P>

      <P>The European Convention on the non-applicability of statutory limitation to crimes against humanity and war crimes was opened for signature on 25 January 1974. It has been signed by Belgium, France, The Netherlands and Romania. The Netherlands is the only state to have ratified. The Convention has not entered into force since it has not been ratified by the required number of countries. The United Nations Convention on the non-applicability of statutory limitation to crimes aginst humanity and war crimes was opened for signature on 16 December 1968. It entered into force on 11 November 1970 and has been ratified by 43 countries.</P>
      <P>The object of these Conventions is to encourage the adoption of measures by Contracting States to ensure that statutory limitations shall not apply to crimes against humanity and war crimes. The position in this jurisdiction is that statutory limitations do not apply to criminal offences and, accordingly, the question of signature and ratification by Ireland of these Conventions is not seen as a priority and has not received consideration in recent time. The Government has, therefore, no immediate plans to arrange for the ratification by Ireland of either Convention.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received representations from the Federation of Irish Societies to reduce the cost of Irish passports in view of the fact that that a person entitled to get an Irish passport in the United Kingdom has to pay £40 where the equivalent United Kingdom passport is £21 which is a financial disincentive for Irish people who wish to assert continuation of their own Irish identity within the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the fee for a British passport is significantly less than that for an Irish passport, the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain regularly asks us to reduce the Irish fee on the grounds that it is a disincentive for Irish citizens who are also British citizens from applying for Irish passports.</P>
      <P>The position of successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs is that it would be inequitable for Irish citizens at home to have to pay higher fees for passports than Irish citizens in Britain or any other foreign country. Such a concession would also mean a significant loss of revenue to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Passport fees are set independently by EU countries. Our fee of IR£45 (Stg.£40) is about the average of passport fees of the EU countries while the fee for a British passport is among the lowest.</P>

      <P>In 1995 the Government decided on a range of measures to improve law enforcement in relation to the illegal importation of drugs. These measures included, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of a joint task force involving the gardaí, the Customs Service and the Naval Service. The measures also included the designation of certain Naval personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994. This statutory authority allows Naval Service personnel to board and detain vessels suspected of being involved in illegal drug trafficking, without the necessity of having a member of the Garda Síochána present. In practice however, this power has been operated to-date under the direction of the joint task force.</P>
      <P>Since the formation of the aforementioned joint task force, the Naval Service has been involved in 19 drug interdiction missions. The prosecution of personnel involved in such activities is a matter for the gardaí.</P>

      <P>The statistical information sought by the Deputy is not readily available and would take some considerable time to collate. Screening audiograms are carried out on FCA personnel by the Army Medical Corps. Where a screening audiogram shows hearing loss of a certain degree, depending on factors such as age, the person is referred to an ENT consultant for a definitive audiogram and medical opinion in compliance with health and safety regulations. In the case of FCA personnel, it is the practice of the Medical Corps to give a person, whose result at screening audiometry indicates the need for such a consultant referral, a letter for their general practitioner in which the results of the screening audiometry are given, and referral to an ENT consultant is requested. While the Army Medical Corps carries out the screening audiograms, the provision of any subsequent medical care is a matter between the individual and their own personal health care provider. This procedure ensures that any medical problems can be attended to in the most appropriate health care setting. However, the results of the ENT consultant's examination may not necessarily be reported back to the Army Medical Corps in every single case.</P>
      <P>The military authorities are aware of a number of FCA personnel, whose results as measured by an ENT consultant, were better than those found at screening audiometry. An investigation by the Army Medical Corps did not reveal any definite reason as to why this was so.</P>
      <P>In all cases where evidence of hearing loss is identified by screening audiograms, diagnostic audiograms are also requested. Ultimate gradings are determined by the results of the diagnostic audiogram.</P>

      <P>In order to be considered for payment of headage grants herdowners must submit a valid area aid application for the relevant year. The area aid application for the person named was received on 10 June 1998 and consequently under EU regulations cannot be accepted. The closing date for receipt of applications was 15 May. Where applications were submitted up to 9 June, they could be accepted and a penalty applied. Applications received after that date could not be accepted.</P>
      <P>Without a valid area aid application, premium payments can issue for up to 15 livestock units equivalent. Payments in respect of the suckler cow premium and special beef premium applications for the person named issued on 11 February 1999 and on 15 February 1999, respectively.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the national commonage framework plan agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, pending the completion of the individual commonage framework plans, enables farmers with owned commonage to join the revised REP scheme for natural heritage areas (NHAs) and commonage land. Farmers who have leased commonage lands and farmers who have not farmed the commonage will be eligible to participate in the REP scheme in respect of other lands farmed by them but will not qualify for the additional payments in the enhanced REP scheme for NHAs and commonage land.</P>
      <P>Currently there are approximately 40,000 participants in REPS and this figure is expected to rise as a result of the new measure being introduced. A total of £132.75 million was paid to REPS participants in 1998 and estimated expenditure in 1999 is £178.00 million.</P>

      <P>The objectives of the REP scheme include the establishment of farming practices and production methods which reflect the need for environmental conservation and protection, the protection of wildlife habitats and endangered species of flora and fauna and the producton of quality food in an environmentally friendly manner.</P>
      <P>The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, is in the process of drawing up commonage framework plans in consultation with my Department. The main aim of these plans is to set sustainable stocking levels which will allow for the regeneration of damaged vegetation. Where commonages are found to be degraded, this will result in a reduction of the existing stocking densities and all participants with qualifying commonage land will be eligible to apply for the increased payment rates under supplementary measure A of the REP scheme.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission has not yet approved any aspects of the pilot rural renewal scheme. The business elements of the scheme were formally notified to the EU Commission on 17 September 1998 as EU Commission approval is needed for these elements i.e. capital allowances and double rent relief. The latest position is that the Commission has written to us with several queries arising from our initial application. The reply to them is currently being prepared. Some of the questions are of a standard nature relating to the types of enterprises that may be permitted under EU state aids rules. Other questions relate to the interaction of operating aid with the new regional aid guidelines published by the Commission, including the link between the nature of the handicaps addressed by the operating aid and the nature of the aid. There are further questions about aid intensity ceilings. It will be necessary to have further discussions between my Department and the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment before finalising the Irish response to all the questions.</P>
      <P>I would stress that this is part of the normal process associated with obtaining EU approval and that the procedure may take some time to complete. Any final decision made by the Commission in this context will be announced at the appropriate time. EU Commission approval is not needed for the residential elements of the rural renewal scheme and the reliefs for the rented residential accommodation under the scheme commenced on 1 June 1998. In addition, I have made provision in section 41 of the 1999 Finance Bill for the introduction of owner-occupier reliefs under the rural renewal scheme for expenditure incurred after 6 April 1999 in the construction, conversion and refurbishment of qualifying residential property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the estimated qualifying expenditure under the seaside resort scheme is of the order of £250 million with a potential cost to the Exchequer of the order of £110 million. These figures are based on a survey of tax districts in which <Col N="698" /> eight of the main qualifying areas are located. This estimate of costs reflects not only the cost incurred on foot of claims allowed to date but also the residual cost over future years arising from these claims as well as projects that are either not yet completed or not yet commenced.</P>
    <P>In my budget speech I announced extensions to the multi-storey car park scheme for projects located outside the  Dublin and Cork metropolitan areas, the designated islands scheme, the residential elements of both the 1994 urban renewal scheme and Temple Bar scheme and the seaside resort scheme. I also stated that the estimated cost of all these extensions would be £3.5 million in 1999 and £6 million in 2000. These estimated cost figures were based on the number of projects that my Department was informed would qualify under the proposed extensions. In the case of the seaside resort scheme, it appears that due to amendments in the scheme proposed since the budget and an increase in the take up of the scheme, the original estimate of the potential cost of the extension will have to be revised significantly upwards. However, it is not possible at this stage to indicate what the revised cost will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme the Deputy is referring to is the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme. The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The scheme targets relief at those persons who are severely and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions of the scheme was carried out in 1993-94 and resulted in the adoption of the current regulations. The six types of disablement are as follows:&ndash; (a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; (b) persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; (c) persons without both hands or without both arms; (d) persons without one or both legs; (e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and, (f) persons having the medi<Col N="699" /> cal condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
    <P>These criteria relate essentially to disabilities which seriously and permanently impair the physical mobility of the person concerned and reflect the origins of the scheme as a relief for disabled persons who were confirmed to wheelchairs but nevertheless were capable of driving suitably adapted cars. For this reason, visual impairment is not a disability which comes within the scope of the specified medical criteria. The scheme can also be said of many other medical conditions which although disabling, do not compromise the physical mobility of the person concerned to a serious degree.</P>
    <P>An inter-departmental group has recently been established, under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with a view to determine what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the scheme.</P>

The taxpayer's application for the one-parent family allowance, which the inspector of taxes received in January 1997, indicated that the taxpayer's son would be attending school until the end of the 1996/97 academic year. No claim for the one-parent family allowance has been received in respect of 1998/99. The inspector of taxes has written to the taxpayer requesting information to enable the inspector of establish whether or not the taxpayer is eligible for the one-parent family allowance in the current tax year.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to reducing the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and to improve incentives to work. In my budget speech last December I stated that &ldquo;I intend to deliver over the five budgets of this Government the tax proposals as agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> In my first budget, I concentrated on providing relief to all taxpayers through a package which concentrated particularly on cuts in both the standard and higher rates. In this year's budget, I introduced a major reform of the tax system which aimed to remove as many people as possible from the tax net and to maximise the incentive to work. This involved standard rating the basic personal and PAYE allowances, and increasing these allowances significantly. The standard rated personal allowance was increased by £1,050 single, £2,100 married to £4,200 single, £8,400 married. The standard rated PAYE allowance was increased by £200 to £1,000. These changes represented the first step in a move to a full tax credits system. The budget 1999 package focuses resources on the lower paid. The result of these changes will be to ensure that a single person on PAYE will not pay tax on any income below £100 per week. Because of the significant cost of this reform, it was not possible in this year's budget to further reduce the rates of income tax, but this will be addressed in future budgets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance (No. 2) Act of 1998 introduced a number of tax measures to assist those wishing to purchase houses as owner occupiers. The Act gave effect to tax measures which represented a significant part of the Government's package of measures aimed at addressing problems in the housing market. This is a three pronged approach aimed at increasing the supply of serviced land, reducing excess investor demand and assisting ordinary house purchasers.</P>
      <P>The Act introduced three tax measures to achieve these aims. It reduced the rate of capital gains chargeable on development land, for a limited period, in order to encourage the early release of such land for building. It restructured the stamp duty regime, first by reducing the rates applicable on houses at the lower end of the market, and second by imposing stamp duty on new dwellings bought by non-owner occupiers. Most significantly, it removed the deductibility of interest on borrowings for the purchase of rented residential accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures were designed to restore balance to the housing sector &ndash; balance between supply and demand, and balance between investors and owner occupiers. It was recognised at their introduction, that those measures aimed at alleviating excess demand would have a more immediate effect while the measures aimed at improving supply would take longer to have an impact. The evidence to date shows that the demand side measures are having the desired <Col N="702" /> effect. The rate of increase in house prices has moderated. All the reports suggest that owner occupiers have replaced investors as purchasers of new homes.</P>
    <P>These measures, taken in conjunction with the significant reduction in interest rates in the final quarter of last year, have been of considerable benefit to house buyers. In view of this, and the time frame required for these measures to have their effect, I have no proposals at present to introduce new taxation measures to assist house buyers. However, this area is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>It is clearly a central objective of the Government to maximise Ireland's receipts under the Structural Funds in the next round. It has to be recognised that Ireland cannot expect to obtain the equivalent level of transfers as it did in the current round. The Government accepts that a lower transfer will be inevitable. However, the level of transfer must be fair and equitable having regard to Ireland's infrastructural backlog relative to most of the EU. This has been the Government's strategy since the publication of the European Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's reference to a recent application presumably refers to the case made by Ireland to EUROSTAT to introduce a greater degree of regionalisation. This application, currently being negotiated, would have the effect of changing Ireland's classification from its existing status as a single NUTS II region to two NUTS II regions for Structural Funds purposes. The creation of two regions at NUTS II level will be fully consistent with the aims of the Government's regional policy and with the desire of the European Commission, as outlined in Agenda 2000 and other policy statements, to achieve a greater influence of local interests over regional policy and bring about a better concentration of resources in the areas of greatest need in the next round.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 239 together.</P>
      <P>The GMO and novel food sub-committee was originally set up as a working group under the auspices of the Food Safety Advisory board and held its first meeting on 14 November 1996. This sub-committee advises my Department on an ongoing basis on issues in the area of genetic modification of foodstuffs. The sub-committee also affords a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology and its application to food. The work of the sub-committee is ongoing commensurate with developments in the area of genetic moficiation.</P>
      <P>The GMO and novel foods sub-committee acts as the assessment body for applications made under Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients. To date, no application for the placing of a novel food on the Irish market has been made to my Department as the Irish competent authority although the sub-committee has commented on a number of applications which have been made to other member states.</P>
      <P>The committee also comments on the human health aspects of applications made under Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. This directive is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and it is enforced on his behalf by the Environmental Protection Agency. I understand that the GMO and novel foods sub-committee is in the process of preparing a report on GMOs and novel foods. No decision has yet been made as to its publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 242 together.</P>
      <P>Regulation (EC) No. 259/97 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients came into force in all member states on 15 May 1997 and introduced a statutory pre-market approval system for novel foods, including genetically modified foods, throughout the  European Union. The regulation provides that foods which are substantially equivalent to others do not have to undergo the same safety assessment that is required for all other novel foods. A novel food is substantially equivalent to an existing food if, on the basis of scientific evidence or an opinion delivered by one of the competent bodies for the purposes of this regulation, it is deemed to be identical as regards composition, nutritional value, metabolism, intended use and the level of undesirable substances contained therein. The labelling provisions of the regulations still apply to the food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The World Health Organisation, WHO, and Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, OECD, introduced the concept of substantial equivalance with particular reference to foods produced by modern biotechnology. This concept embodies the idea that existing organisms used as foods or food sources can serve as a <Col N="706" /> basis for comparison when assessing the safety and nutritional value of a food or food ingredient that has been modified or is new. If a food or food ingredient is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient, it can be treated in the same manner with respect to safety and nutritional value, keeping in mind that establishment of substantial equivalence is not a safety or nutritional assessment in itself, but an approach to compare a potential new food with its conventional counterpart.</P>
    <P>If a company wants to launch a product on the EU market, it can deem the product to be substantially equivalent providing it falls into one of the following categories: foods and food ingredients produced from, but not containing GMOs; foods and food ingredients consisting of or isolated from micro-organisms, fungi or algae; and foods and food ingredients consisting of or isolated from plants and food ingredients isolated from animals, except for foods and food ingredients obtained by traditional propagating or breeding practices and having a history of safe food use.</P>
    <P>A company wishing to launch the product can claim substantial equivalance and then place the product on the market. In this instance, the company must inform the Commission that they are placing the product on the market. Alternatively, the company can approach a competent authority, claim that a product is substantially equivalent to another one and request verification of this claim. All other member states are informed by the Commission that such a product is being placed on the market and are given an opportunity to raise an objection about its substantially equivalent status. The following products have been notified to the Commission as substantially equivalent:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of dental treatment and the recruitment of dental staff in North Mayo are the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. I have had inquiries made of the Western Health Board. I understand that the Western Health Board placed advertisements for dental vacancies in all Western Health Board areas in October 1998 in several publications i.e. <i>Irish Independent</i>, <i>Sunday Independent</i>, <i>Irish News </i>and <i>British Dental Journal.</i>Applications were received expressing an interest in posts in Galway and Roscommon but unfortunately no applications were received for the Mayo vacancies which were advertised again on the 7 February 1999 in the same publications but to date there has been no response.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure continuity of service, emergency cover is provided by the existing health board dentists to children in the affected areas. In addition the Western Health Board is at present examining the possibilities of engaging private dentists on a contract basis to provide services for children. I understand that the Western Health Board has made an agreement with a private dental practitioner in the Belmullet area to provide a service to second and sixth classes in one school on a pilot basis. If successful, this service will be extended to other schools in the area.</P>

      <P>The dental treatment services for children in national schools are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. For the past number of years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>The school-based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools. Children in second, fourth and sixth classes are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach. Subject to available resources the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The  small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment, etc. provided as necessary.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, some health boards can have difficulty in filling dental posts in geographically remote areas and in fully implementing the school-based approach. I have asked my Department to explore with health boards ways in which it might be possible for the boards to provide an adequate dental service to children in areas which experience persistent recruitment difficulties.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, everyone, regardless of income is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges, from which medical card holders are exempt. At present these charges are set at £25 per night, subject to a maximum of £250 in any 12 month period, in respect of in-patient public hospital services. Any patient who is formally admitted to a bed which has been designated as a public day bed, is regarded as an in-patient of the hospital and is therefore liable for the £25 in-patient charge, unless otherwise exempt. Non-medical card holders are entitled to public out-patient services free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. <Col N="709" /> Private patients are liable for the appropriate accommodation charges and consultants' fees in addition to the statutory charges. All persons who opt for private treatment are liable for any expenses they incur and neither the Department of Health and Children nor the health board is in a position to provide financial assistance towards these costs. I would also like to mention that it is possible to obtain tax relief on unreimbursed medical expenses. The person concerned should contact his local tax office in this regard.</P>

All necessary follow-up services for defects discovered at these examinations are provided free of charge and continue until the condition has been fully treated. In the case of dental services, I propose to extend entitlement up to 16 years of age later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the health promotion unit of my Department, either on its own, in conjunction with the health boards or in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, has developed a range of initiatives that contribute to the promotion of health amongst our young people in the school setting.  These include programmes relating to issues such as drugs, HIV, AIDS, nutrition and exercise but more recently significant support has been accorded to the health promotion school initiative which assesses the importance of the school setting in promoting health and introduces programmes and practices <Col N="710" /> that support efforts on behalf of all in the school community to ensure a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, officials from my Department have been involved with course committees of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in developing social, personal and health education syllabi which will contribute to the curricular components of this area in the future.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the consultant's contract, a consultant's commitment to his/her public patients is continuous for so long as he or she is responsible for that patient's care. Within that overall commitment consultants have a scheduled commitment which reflects the periods of time during which they are expected to be physically present in the public hospital or otherwise engaged on behalf of the public hospital. In the case of a full-time commitment this equates to 11 sessions on 33 notional hours per week. The contract allows hospital managers to monitor the consultant's scheduled commitment and to take appropriate action if they are not satisfied that the consultant's commitment to public patients is being properly discharged.</P>

      <Quest>the reason he proposes to increase the threshold from £32 to £42 per month before families can get a refund on the cost of prescribed drugs used in any one month; if he will review this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements in the existing schemes. The new scheme will effectively merge the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new family scheme will have significant advantages over the existing drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. Many families and individuals have very heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and have to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter before they receive a refund. This <Col N="711" /> can cause considerable cash flow problems for a significant number of families and individuals. This will not happen under the new drug payment scheme. From the introduction of the new scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines. It means that families and individuals will, for the first time, be able to budget for the cost of medicines. Families and individuals will know that, whatever the size of their drugs bill, they will not have to pay more than £42 per month. In addition, there are families where, although one member may qualify for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card, combined expenditure on medicines by other members, which can be considerable, cannot be recouped until the end of the quarter. With the new drug payment scheme, no family will have to pay more than £42 in any month for prescribed medicines. The new scheme will be of significant benefit to such families.</P>
    <P>The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the current drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example, in one month have expenditure of say £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
    <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion on the new drug payment scheme. Where expenditure by a family or an individual exceeds £42 per month on prescribed medicines, the balance will be met by the State. This in in contrast to the old DCSS scheme, where patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase in the threshold from £32 to £42, the position is that there has been no increase in the threshold for the existing schemes since 1991. It must also be borne in mind that the new £42 threshold in respect of the drug payment scheme refers to family expenditure in contrast to the existing £32 threshold in the drug cost subsidisation scheme, which relates to individual expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children, and despite the many competing demands which are made on the resources available to my Department, I have consistently identified as one of my priorities the provision of the additional residential, respite and day services outlined in the document, &ldquo;Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &ndash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since June 1997 I have allocated an additional £53 million, with a full year cost of £59 million in 2000, towards the cost of meeting the needs identified in the assessment of need. In the three year period 1995 to 1997, the previous Government allocated a total of £36.22 million in capital and revenue funding, or on average just over £12 million per year to these services. This compares with an average of over £25 million per year allocated by me to these services to date.</P>
      <P>I have also put in place a £30 million national capital programme to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need to provide the infrastructure necessary to support the services. This is the first time that such a programme has been provided and it allows for a much more co-ordinated approach to be taken in the planning of services as opposed to the haphazard approach taken in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> In 1998, 220 new residential places and over 300 new day places were put in place from the additional revenue and capital funding provided that year. In 1999 it is estimated that the additional funding will allow for the development of the following: approximately 400 new residential respite places; approximately 200 new day care places; the transfer of persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropirate placements; health related support services for school-going children with autism; and additional specialist and other support services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The delivery of acute hospital services at the Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene, is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. As the Deputy will be aware, in September 1997 the South-Eastern Health Board unanimously adopted a plan for the Kilkenny Hospital system that involves the rationalisation of all hospital services in Kilkenny city onto the St. Luke's Hospital site. This plan involves the development of existing services in St. Luke's, the addition of new specialities of acute psychiatry, paediatrics, geriatics &ndash; including a long-stay unit &ndash; the further development of community services and the provision of a community hospital to support the acute hospital.</P>
      <P>A central element of this plan will involve the transfer of elective orthopaedics from Kilcreene to Waterford Regional Hospital in line with the conclusions of a major review of orthopaedic services in the region which was completed in 1992 by a joint Department of Health-Comhairle na nOspidéal expert review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full implementation of the Kilkenny Hospital plan will require progress on a number of fronts, including the provision of suitable accommodation at Waterford Regional Hospital for the transfer of elective orthopaedic services there. In view of the complexities inherent in co-ordinating the implementation of the plan, a project team, involving officials, medical and nursing <Col N="718" /> staff of the South-Eastern Health Board and officials of my Department has been established to draw up an implementation timetable, a priority list for the developments and to work on costings. A joint management-unions group has also been established to develop career options and to provide career guidance, advice and training, as necessary, for nurses and other staff at Kilcreene who will be affected by the impending changes.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, elective orthopaedic procedures will continue to be performed at the hospital while this process of implementation, in consultation with all relevant interests, is under way. In this context, the South-Eastern Health Board is conscious of the ongoing maintenance needs of the hospital, pending the full transfer of services under the Kilkenny plan. It is a matter for the board to address these ongoing needs in the normal way in the context of overall funding available to them for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the psychiatric committal system operated under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 has collapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, as amended by subsequent Acts, lays down detention procedures for persons with mental disorder under three categories; either as a temporary patient, a person of unsound mind or an addict. Briefly the procedures governing the involuntary admission of a patient to a psychiatric hospital or unit are as follows. In the first instance an application for a person to be admitted as an involuntary patient <Col N="720" /> is completed, normally by a spouse or relative of the patient. The application must be made to the person in charge of the hospital and be accompanied by a recommendation from a registered medical practitioner that following examination, in his or her opinion, the person meets the criteria for involuntary admission. In the case of a private patient, two medical practitioners must certify, following separate examinations, that the person meets the criteria for involuntary admission. The decision to make an involuntary admission order on the basis of the application and accompanying certificate from one or two medical practitioners is a clinical decision taken by a medical officer in the psychiatric hospital or unit. I am satisfied that these procedures are operating satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The powers of the gardaí under the Mental Treatment Act are limited to assisting in the conveyance of a patient who is the subject of an application for detention as person of unsound mind in accordance with section 169 of the Act. Section 184 relates to the making of an application for a temporary involuntary admission order and in such cases the gardaí are not empowered to provide assistance in the conveyance of the person to hospital. In normal circumstances the applicant would accompany the person to hospital. Where the applicant is unable to convey the person to hospital, nursing staff of the hospital where the person is to be conveyed usually provide assistance. I am aware, however, that some nursing staff in one health board are refusing to assist in the conveyance of patients to hospital. In such cases, other health professional staff assist in the conveyance of patients as the need arises.</P>
    <P>New mental health legislation, currently being prepared in the Office of the Attorney General, will empower the Garda Síochána to assist, where necessary, health professionals in ensuring that persons who need to be detained are conveyed to hospital with the minimum delay.</P>

      <P>I recently accepted a recommendation by the National Cancer Forum that all childhood cases of leukaemia should be referred for initial assessment to the specialist paediatric oncology unit at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. This was taken on the basis of best international practice, It arose from a recommendation to me from the forum, an expert body which advises me on the implementation of the national cancer strategy and related matters.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that the only change to current practice will be that newly diagnosed cases will be referred for initial assessment and treatment planning in Crumlin. This does not mean that all cases would necessarily have to be treated in Crumlin.

      <P>I recently met representatives from CHILD, Children's Hospital in Leukaemia Drive, and I reassured them that there would be no transfer of resources, whether equipment or staff, from the new unit at Tallaght. The decision made regarding cancer treatment will also not affect current services being provided for children at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>My Department has written to the chairman of the National Children's Hospital setting out my desire for a structured collaboration between the three Dublin children's hospitals. In this context, I feel that it should now be possible to develop a positive agenda for improvement of paediatric services to which each hospital can subscribe.</P>
      <P>I again emphasise that primacy must be given to the best interests of our sick children, including those requiring oncology and haematology services.</P>

    <P>Regarding the Deputy's question concerning the development of a north County Dublin based hospital to meet the increasing demands of the growing north Dublin suburb, he will be aware <Col N="723" /> that I recently announced that the level of capital investment in the health services for the next three years has been decided. Exchequer capital spending on the health service infrastructure will total £525 million over the next three years and include provision for a number of major hospital developments in the north Dublin region. In this context, it is worth mentioning two major developments which are under way in north Dublin.</P>
    <P>First, the Deputy will be aware that a major development project for the Mater Hospital has been under discussion for some time. Consequently, I was pleased to be in a position to approve the development of phase I of the project in November 1997, at a cost limit of £25 million.</P>
    <P>In May 1998, I approved the appointment of the design team for the development. Its initial task will be the preparation of a development control plan, DCP, for the entire Mater site, including the relocation of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, followed by phase I of the development. Phase I will include a new accident and emergency department, a new out patient department; a new hospital sterile services department and new operating theatres. The construction of Phase I is expected to commence in 2000 and there is a general acceptance that phase II, which includes the relocation of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street on the Mater campus, should proceed as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>Second, in January 1998 I gave the go ahead to the capital development programme for James Connolly Memorial Hospital, which provides for the inclusion of new acute wards and the refurbishment of existing wards, new intensive care and coronary care units, a new accident and emergency department and a new department of physical medicine. Detailed accommodation briefs have been finalised for this development and are currently under consideration by my Department. The development will be on a phased basis with phase I scheduled for completion in 2001.</P>
    <P>While there are no plans for the development of a new hospital on the northside of Dublin or in the north County Dublin area in the immediate future, my Department is keeping the situation in relation to acute hospital services under review with regard to changes in demographics within the eastern region.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that pending the completion of the above developments it is vital that existing services on the north side of the city are maintained to a high standard. For this reason, in 1999, my Department approved additional funding of £4.306 million for Beaumont Hospital for service developments, medical equipment, 1999 waiting list initiative, cardiovascular strategy, cancer strategy and accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the additional funding and capital developments which I mentioned above are evidence of this Government's commitment to Beaumont <Col N="724" /> Hospital and to the overall improvement of acute hospital services on the north side of Dublin.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Callely</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the location and speciality of the recognised national hospitals; the hospitals and the number of beds in each hospital in the Dublin area that are allocated to their specialty; the waiting list for each hospital; if he will provide a regional breakdown of those waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6203/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of formally designated national specialty services within individual hospitals in Dublin. These would include the National Cardiac Surgery Unit at the Mater Hospital, the National Liver Transplant Centre at St. Vincent's Hospital and the National Neurosurgery Centre at Beaumont Hospital, by way of example. In addition, some of the major acute providers offer services which are often perceived as national specialties by virtue of the degree of specialist expertise which has been developed within the relevant hospitals by individual consultants or the specialties concerned.</P>
      <P>National specialties are provided as part of the individual hospital's overall services and bed capacity and as such are resourced within the hospital's total annual determination; it would not be possible to provide a breakdown of the beds allocated to each national specialty.</P>
      <P>In the context of the proposed establishment of the new eastern regional health authority, there are a number of critical issues which fall to be considered regarding future arrangements for the formal designation of and funding arrangements for national specialty services. My Department has indicated to the chief executive officers of the major hospitals that this issue is currently under detailed consideration within the Department.</P>
      <P>My Department is conscious of the need to improve efficiencies in the delivery of acute services, both at regional and national level and to ensure that the patient interest is served at all times. The recently announced proposals for the establishment of joint structures for both the paediatric and maternity services serve as an example of a departmental initiative in this area. My Department is considering the scope for developing other collaborative networks within the acute sector with the aim of improving service provision at local, regional and national levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally with regard to the Deputy's query about waiting lists, I must point out that waiting list figures collected by my Department relate to the numbers of people on the in-patient waiting lists of a particular hospital rather than to a patient's place of residence. It would not therefore be possible to give details of people waiting on a county by county basis. The numbers on the waiting list at all the acute Dublin hospitals at the end of December 1998, the most recent period <Col N="725" /> for which information is available is as per attached list.</P>

      <P>I am aware that differences exist in service provision for people with physical and sensory disabilities between different areas of the country. This is due to differing needs, differing responses to service needs, historical and many other factors. This was one of the key issues examined by the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities. In its report, Towards an Independent Future, the group recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services in each health board. These committees provide a structure for the involvement of voluntary sector service providers and people with disabilities themselves in the planning and co-ordination of services at local level. The committees are now in operation in all health boards. The review group also recommended the establishment of a database on the health service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities. I have established a database development committee which is preparing detailed proposals for the development of the database.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>The information on residential and respite places available to people with physical and sensory disabilities has been requested from the health boards. This  information has not, as yet, been received from all of the boards. It will be furnished to the Deputy as soon as it is to hand.</P>
      <P>Respite care for people with physical and sensory disabilities and their carers is provided by means of a range of support services, such as home support and day activity services, as well as residential respite care. The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, in making recommendations for the development of the services, distinguishes between respite care services provided in non-residential and that provided in residential settings.</P>
      <P>Since my Government took office it has provided a total of £36.55 million for the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £3 million, £6 million full year cost in the year 2000, has been provided for the development of the services this year. Priorities for the allocation of this funding will be decided by health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disabilities services. The provision of additional residential care services will be considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information from the national intellectual disability database indicated that, as at September 1996, 7,572 persons with a mental handicap were in receipt of five or seven day residential services. 14,989 persons were in receipt of day services, of whom 1,875 also received residential support services. A further 243 persons were identified as receiving residential support services only. However, because of the fact that, for most people, respite services are provided as a secondary service, in addition to their primary service, which would be either in educational or day placement, the level of reporting of this secondary service in 1996 did not fully reflect the level of respite services being provided. Data in respect of 1998, which I expect will be available in the next three months, will more fully reflect the level of respite service for people with mental handicap and autism and I will arrange for this information <Col N="727" /> to be forwarded to the Deputy when it becomes available.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, respite services are provided in a number of ways. In addition to those services provided in a residential setting, respite care is also provided by host families through the various share a break and other similar schemes, where individuals are placed with families who offer to assist in caring for persons wit a mental handicap and autism.</P>
    <P>My Department's Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, which is based on information from the national intellectual disability database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap, including the need for residential-respite places. That assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places during the period 1997-2001, at a revenue cost of £63.5 million.</P>
    <P>This year I was pleased to be in a position to provide additional revenue funding of £12 million, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, to continue the process of meeting these needs. This funding will provide approximately 320 new residential places; 80 new respite places and 200 new day places. It will also provide additional health related support services for children with autism, continue the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate placements and provide additional specialist and other support services.</P>
    <P>The provision of 80 new places specifically for respite care will enhance the level of respite services available to persons with a mental handicap and autism.</P>
    <P>Capital funding of at least £10 million will also be made available from the national capital programme to support the new service developments in 1999. This brings to £53 million, at a full year cost of £59 million, the funding which I have allocated towards meeting the requirements set out in the Assessment of Need, since my appointment in June 1997.</P>

      <P>The total number of designated acute hospital beds at 25 January 1999 was 12,286. The existing acute hospital bed stock has been accommodating an ever increasing level of activity in the acute hospital sector over recent years. In the period January to October 1998, for instance, total discharges, both in-patient and day cases, in the <Col N="728" /> acute hospital system were up 3 per cent on the same period in 1997. The increasing level of activity is largely being facilitated by significant increases in the level of hospital care being delivered on a day case basis, in line with trends in modern medical practice. In 1998, day case activity for the first ten months of the year showed an increase of almost 9 per cent over the same period in 1997. This trend, together with increased activity at out-patient level and reduced in-patient average lengths of stay, points to the achievement of a more effective use of the acute hospital bed stock to the benefit of the many thousands of extra patients who are now receiving treatment in our hospitals.</P>
      <P>The adequacy of existing resources, including bed numbers, to meet the needs of the population is kept under constant review, particularly in light of emerging demographic trends. In this regard, it has been agreed with the Department of Finance that the next major programme review of health expenditure should focus on acute hospitals and services for the elderly. It is proposed that the review will address the existing overall capacity of the system, taking account of changing demographic structures and equity of access to services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total level of activity, elective and emergency, delivered in the acute hospital system in the first 11 months of last year was up 3 per on the same period in 1997. This increase in activity enabled some 23,000 more patients to be seen on an in-patient or day case basis and over 15,000 more patients to be treated in accident and emergency departments than in the corresponding 1997 period. Similarly, over 50,000 more out-patient attendances were recorded in the first ten months of last year than in the same period in 1997. The ability of hospitals to deliver this level of additional activity in 1998 was facilitated by the additional resources made available for specific acute hospital service developments in 1998 of £44 million and by continuing trends towards the increased delivery  of services on a day case and out-patient basis. The number of patients treated on a day case basis in the first 11 months of 1998 was up 9 per cent over the same period in 1997.</P>
      <P>In developing and delivering service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day case and out-patient care is a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity. The level of projected elective activity would be planned to take account of anticipated levels of emergency admissions over the period. In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures would also form a part of the local bed management function aimed at optimising the overall activity delivered within the resources available. The number of bed days lost through temporary bed closures in 1998 accounted for just 2 per cent of the total number of bed days available.</P>
      <P>The performance of the acute hospital sector in 1998 in delivering on service plans to provide treatment to a greater number of people than ever before is strong evidence that the system is working well to meet the needs of the population. Conscious of the ongoing conflict between available resources and the competing infinite demands for services, I am aware that, while this is being achieved, difficult choices often continue to have to be made at an operational level. In any modern health system this will always remain the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognising that, the scale of increase in overall resources devoted to the public health services in 1998 and 1999 reflects the strong commitment of this Government to addressing the genuine needs that exist. In 1999 non-capital expenditure on health will be some £3.4 billion, an increase of approximately 10 per cent on the <Col N="730" /> 1998 out-turn level when hepatitis C compensation payments are excluded. This follows on a similar increase of 7 per cent in 1998 over 1997. In the context of overall Government spending policy, these increases represent a major statement of priority on our part. In working with health boards and hospitals to maximise the impact of this investment on the health and social status of the population, it is my intention to continue to develop services and to seek improvements wherever possible in the delivery of care.</P>

    <P>The orthodontic services continue to be developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service. This ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
    <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services. The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan.</P>
    <P>I understand that this group has recently made its report to the chief executive officers of the health boards and is now under consideration by them.</P>

      <P>While it is recognised that a dog can provide both a sense of security and companionship to many elderly people, it would not, unfortunately, be feasible to introduce such a scheme without incurring substantial administrative costs and a loss of revenue to the local authorities who rely on the revenue from the sale of dog licences to finance their dog control activities. At a practical level also, such a scheme would give rise to difficulties for local authorities in attempting to establish the true ownership of a dog which was covered by a reduced fee licence but which was being kept by person who was not eligible for such a licence.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back-to-work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to long-term unemployed people, who could not otherwise do so, to return to work and it has been most successful in this regard.</P>
      <P>The scheme is non-statutory and, consequently, decisions cannot be appealed to the social welfare appeals office. All appeals are determined centrally by a more senior officer to ensure consistency.</P>
      <P>The scheme is aimed at people taking up stable employment or self-employment. Consequently work of an occasional, temporary or casual nature, short-term, seasonal work or work of a contractual or commission nature does not qualify for the scheme. If for any reason a person loses his/her job, payment of the allowance is suspended, and returned to the live register. However, the allowance is restored if he/she obtains further employment which satisfies the criteria. The scheme is not, however, for situations where people who take up work intermittently.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain people with disabilities under the age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. It is also available to carers in receipt of carer's allowance and from April 1999, free travel will be available to carers of people in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relative's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. At the end <Col N="740" /> of 1998, over 530,000 free travel passes were issued at an annual cost of £32.6 million.</P>
    <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
    <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Time restrictions have been put in place because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening.</P>
    <P>There are no peak time restrictions on DART or suburban rail services provided by CIE and private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most effective and effecient manner.

    <P>The free travel scheme, as in the case of other social welfare schemes in Ireland, is available to all eligible persons irrespective of nationality. It would not be possible to extend the scheme to Irish nationals resident in Britain as this could be contrary to EU law, which in many instances prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement scheme is designed to provide employees with families and on low incomes with an incentive to take up, or to remain in, low-paid employment. In order to enhance the value of the scheme and increase the return from work, and in accordance with a commitment given in the Partnership 2000 agreement, I gave priority attention to reforming the scheme on coming into office. Accordingly, the 1998 budget provided for the reform of the scheme so that entitlement is now calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross income, as was previously the case. This measure was introduced with effect from 1 October 1998.</P>
      <P>This change has already had a positive effect on the number of families qualifying for the supplement. There are now almost 14,000 FIS recipients, the highest number recorded since the scheme was first introduced in 1984.</P>
      <P>In addition, the income thresholds were increased by £7 per week with effect from June 1998. The 1999 budget includes provision for a further increase in the income thresholds of £8 per week. with effect from June 1999.</P>

      <P>The eligibility conditions for community employment are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. At present those eligible for the scheme include recipients of unemployment payments, one-parent family payment and people referred by the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> A widow's pension is not a qualfying payment for community employment. However, my Department will assist widowed persons who wish to participte on a scheme by assessing their eligibility for a qualifying payment, such as the one-parent family payment, and, if possible, transferring them to that payment for the duration of the community employment scheme. At the end of a period on community employment the person can revert to the widow's pension without any particular difficulty.</P>
    <P>The participation of widows on training programmes is part of a much broader issue which relates to the access women in general have to these opportunities. In the normal course someone who has been out of the workforce for a number of years by reason of, for example, working in the home will be excluded from many labour market opportunities. In accordance with a commitment in Partnership 2000, a working group chaired by the Department has been established to examine this issue. It is expected that the report of the group will be completed around the middle of this year and consideration will then be given to what action needs to be taken on foot of its recommendations.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance. From April 1999, the scheme will be available to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. It is also available to people in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension, blind person's pension and other people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. At the end of December 1998, over 530,000 free travel passes had been issued at an annual cost of over £32.6 million.</P>
      <P>The free travel companion pass is available to certain people who are medically assessed as unfit to travel alone. This enables a person, 16 years of age or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, the companion passes are available to the following main groups: recipients of blind person's pension and all blind people who are registered with the national council/league of the blind; recipients of disability allowance who are <Col N="744" /> medically certified as unfit to travel alone. persons in receipt of a qualifying payment who are medically certified as being a permanent wheelchair user; persons receiving care from a carer who is in receipt of a carer's allowance; persons aged 75 years or over who are unfit to travel alone.</P>
    <P>The extension of the scheme to these groups was in recognition of the specific difficulties they experienced when travelling alone. A person in receipt of an invalidity pension may qualify for a companion pass if they are in one of these groups.</P>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most effective and efficient manner and the issue raised by the Deputy will be examined as part of the review process.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated to the Deputy recently that it would not be feasible to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments. As there are over 450,000 people in reciept of social assistance payments, this would  necessitate frequent reviews of entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated or the capital was moved into a different investment option. For this reason a notional value is ascribed to the capital owned.</P>
      <P>There are a wide range of investment options currently available, for example, deposit accounts, special savings accounts, investments in stocks and shares and Government securities etc. The rate of return varies considerably as between these different investment options and, therefore, it would not be possible to calculate the cost of assessing means on the basis of the actual interest earned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the objective of the present capital assessment arrangements, which were introduced by the previous rainbow Government, is to ensure that those with smaller amounts of capital at their disposal receive a greater share of available support then those who <Col N="745" /> have large amounts of capital available to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs.</P>

      <P>Horseriding in the Phoenix Park is governed by the Phoenix Park Act, 1925, and the Phoenix Park, Dublin, bye-laws, 1926. At present horseriding is permitted in the park subject to certain restrictions on routes and breeds of horses. However, horseriding in the park is under review by my Department at present as it requires greater control in order to protect the amenity of the park and to prevent damage and disturbance by horses.</P>
      <P>Although the suggestion of establishing a centre to train young people in the care and upkeep of horses is a laudable one, I do not consider that such a centre would be appropriate in a national historic park. The exclusive use of areas of parkland is incompatible with my Department's aim of maintaining a parkland for passive recreation. My Department's policy, as outlined in the 1986 Phoenix Park management plan, is not to allow any further additions to existing areas of exclusive use. It may be possible, however, to accommodate such a project on lands owned by the local authority.</P>

      <P>The vacancy for chairperson of the management committee arose at the beginning of this year due to the departure of the incumbent, who also represented Meath County Council, to take up a position with another body. While no formal procedures exist for the appointment of a chairperson, it is expected that when the county council nominates a replacement as its representative on the committee, the matter of the chairperson will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management committee has convened regularly since its formation in July 1996. As the Deputy is aware, its main purpose is to ensure an <Col N="748" /> integrated approach to: &ldquo;tourism development, heritage and amenity management in the Valley of the River Boyne, from its upper reaches in Meath to the sea at Drogheda.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this respect the committee has succeeded in providing a forum for consultation and exchange of views among the many public and private interests represented on it. While the committee is not an executive agency, it has been effective in ensuring an integrated approach to the planning of several initiatives and programmes within its terms of reference. These have included the appointment of a fisheries manager to promote the development of angling in the Boyne catchment, the commencement of work on the Boyne Way riverside walk; the establishment of a Boyne Valley promotion company, since absorbed by Meath Tourism Ltd; the launch of a dedicated promotion brochure and design of a distinctive &ldquo;logo&rdquo;, and the commencement of planning for an overall signage strategy and cycle route. From the perspective of my Department's specific remit, the management committee has been kept informed of the ongoing development work and operational arrangements at such sites as Brú na Bóinne, including the Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth archaeological complex, Trim Castle, Tara, Loughcrew, Slane and Bective Abbey. In addition, work on Grange Castle will shortly commence.</P>
    <P>While funding of the many activities addressed under the Boyne Valley integrated development plan is a matter for the individual executive agencies concerned as part of their ongoing responsibilities, a sub-programme specifically associated with the plan is also being pursued by my Department. This includes devlopment of a long-distance walk between Slane and Oldbridge, and improved access and information at Bective Abbey, Slane and Loughcrew. Expenditure of £520,000 has already been incurred in respect of this sub-programme for the riverside walk and a further provision of £50,000 has been made in this year's Estimates.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 160 of 24 February 1999. No specific external studies have been commissioned during the period referred to by the Deputy. However, tenders were sought in June 1997 with the following terms of reference: to determine the present position of the Irish language as a means of communication in the Gaeltacht and to make recommendations in relation to the revision of the present Gaeltacht boundaries; and to assess the impact of the schemes and programmes being operated by An Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta and by Údarás na Gaeltachta on the speaking of Irish as an everyday language in the Gaeltacht and to make recommendations in reaction to the future direction of such schemes and programmes.</P>
      <P>However, I decided not to proceed with the study due to the fact that (1) I was not satisfied with the terms of reference as they were too restrictive; (2) the time frame for carrying out the study was too long in view of the need for urgent action on language policy in the Gaeltacht, and (3) in view of the large amount of money involved taken in conjunction with (1) and (2) above and the large amount of information already available to me in relation to the proposed subject of the study, I felt the money could be better employed in dealing directly with the linguistic pressures on the Gaeltacht rather than pursuing endlessly further studies on the matter.</P>

      <P>The question of the ratification by Ireland of the UN Convention Against the Taking of Hostages is a matter for decision by Government.</P>
      <P>However, before Ireland would be in a position to ratify the convention, certain changes may be necessary in our domestic law. This matter is currently being examined in my Department, which, as the Deputy will be aware, has an extensive programme of legislation at present. Once the legislative position has been clarified and any necessary legislation put in place ratification could then take place. While I am not in a position to give a precise timeframe, the above mentioned examination will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to parental leave under the legislation applies in relation to all parents of children under five years of age born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996.

      <P>I understand that following the Parental Leave Act coming into operation on 3 December 1998, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, formally lodged a complaint with the European Commission to the effect that Ireland had not correctly transposed the EU Directive on Parental Leave as it had restricted entitlement to such leave to parents of children born or adopted on or after 3 June 1996. This complaint is currently at the stage of investigation formally by the European Commission. I have not had any meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on this matter to date. The question as to whether the Act should be amended does not arise at this stage. I should add that my Department has, as yet, received no communication from the European Commission regarding this matter.</P>

      <P>The Act is now operational apart from two important sections. These are sections 26, social reports in District Court, and 28, appointment of guardian <i>ad litem </i>for a child and provision for separate representation of a child. Those two sections, which have some bearing on membership of the convention, have financial and staffing implications for the Probation and Welfare Service and health boards. The implications are being addressed in the context of current overall reviews of delivery of services in these areas and a decision on membership of the convention will be announced in due course.</P>

      <P>I have no record of having received any representations specifically from the Federation of Irish Societies recently. However, I inform the Deputy that I have taken a number of steps to combat racism and intolerance towards persons and groups including asylum seekers and refugees residing in Ireland. Following on the work undertaken during the European Year Against Racism in 1997, I established a national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism in July 1998. The consultative committee operates as a partnership of non-governmental organisations. State agencies, social partners and Government Departments and will advise the Government on matters relating to racism and interculturalism. The committee has been provided with an office premises and facilities in Dublin and an allocation of £90,000 to fund its programme of activities in 1999.</P>
      <P>One of the priorities of the national consultative committee in its forthcoming work programme is to work with Government and non-governmental agencies to develop strategies to address the racism experienced by refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>A revised Employment Equality Bill was enacted in June 1998 and, when it comes into operation later this year, will outlaw discrimination on a number of grounds including race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin. Revised equal status legislation is currently being developed in my Department and I envisage that the Bill will be published before the Dáil resumes after the Easter recess. The proposed Equal Status Bill will prohibit discrimination in non-employment areas, such as education, the provision of goods and services and accommodation, on the same grounds.</P>

The Garda authorities are satisfied that the complainant was informed at the time that a criminal investigation was not warranted.

      <P>The advisory committee that was established by the Garda Commissioner to examine CCTV systems as an aid to policing and to evaluate each application has received in excess of 31 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems, including one from Dún Laoghaire. At present six locations have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing. The prioritised locations are as follows: Bray, Cork, Dublin South Central, Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick. The remaining applications, including Dún Laoghaire, are still under consideration by the committee and it is anticipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as staffing and budgetary resources permit.</P>
      <P>Each of the applications currently under consideration will be prioritised with regard to the respective levels of crime in the locations in question and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on same. Applications are also evaluated from a technical and telecommunications perspective. It is also only fair to state in this regard that the commitment to existing schemes, as well as those prioritised by the advisory committee, limits the scope for the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas at the present time.</P>
      <P>Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and my Department. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera. Each application submitted must also be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their full support.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 338 and 352 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme for the employment of secretaries which was introduced in 1978, my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. This is the scheme under which St. Joseph's junior school and St. Joseph's senior school qualified for the shared secretary arrangement. However this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and there is no provision for the appointment of full-time secretaries in <Col N="761" /> posts which are being shared. In the circumstances it will not be possible to sanction the appointment of an additional full-time secretary to either school.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial services.</P>
    <P>Should the existing shared post fall vacant, my Department will provide both schools with a grant of £15 per pupil per annum towards the cost of secretarial services (subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 to each school) in accordance with the current terms of the PESP scheme.</P>

      <P>The third level student support schemes operated under the aegis of my Department provide a means tested maintenance grant to eligible students who are pursuing approved third level courses.

Different limits apply where there are less than four dependent children, between four and seven dependent children, and eight or more dependent children. Furthermore, where there are two or more children attending full-time third level education or other specified courses, the relevant income limits are increased by £2,060 where there are two such children, £4,120 for three children and so on, by increments of £2,060.</P>

      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged area status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.

As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.</P>

Such requests are examined under various criteria but, in particular, as to whether or not the building will be required for further educational use.</P>
      <P>In the case of Rathmore, it is intended to build a new national school to replace the existing boys school building. The existing site is unsuitable for a new school building because of its size, topography and poor drainage facilities. Strenuous efforts were made locally to acquire an alternative site, but this proved extremely difficult until recently when two possibilities emerged.</P>
      <P>My Department considers it appropriate that the old vocational school building be retained until a site has been obtained for the new boys school. The chief executive officer of the vocational education committee has been notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the last general expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme both at primary level and second level. This expansion took place in 1994 when an additional 54 schools were included in the scheme at primary level and 55 schools at second level.</P>
      <P>On that occasion applicant schools were assessed as to priority of need by reference to a range of criteria which had been agreed between the Department, schools' management and the teacher unions. At primary level, the criteria in question took account of such factors as the levels of unemployment, local authority housing and rented accommodation occupancy and medical card holding among the families of the pupils concerned. The total points scored by schools under the above headings were then weighted by a factor which took account of the prevailing pupil teacher ratios among the applicant schools. At second level, account was also taken of rural disadvantage, lone parent households, literacy-numeracy difficulties and lack of formal educational qualifications.</P>
      <P>At primary level the average percentage of pupils, in the lowest scoring 20 schools of the 54 that were added to the scheme in 1994, whose parents were included in the relevant categories, was as follows: level of unemployment &ndash; 52 per cent; local authority housing &ndash; 45 per cent; rented accommodation occupancy &ndash; 7 per cent and medical card holding &ndash; 55 per cent.</P>
      <P>At second level the relevant percentages were as follows: level of unemployment &ndash; 67 per cent; local housing &ndash; 59 per cent; medical card holding &ndash; 70 per cent; rural disadvantage &ndash; 41 per cent; lone parent households &ndash; 17 per cent; literacy-numeracy &ndash; 50 per cent and formal education qualifications &ndash; 12 per cent.</P>

      <P>The administration of State examinations annually, catering for about 140,000 candidates in over 4,500 examination centres, is a major logistical challenge. The task would become impossible to administer if students having been registered to take the examination in one school were free to subsequently take the examinations in another school. The only reasonable position that the Department can adopt is that once entered by a particular school a student must take his-her examinations in a centre in that school. The Department can exercise some flexibility in exceptional circumstances, e.g., illness.</P>
      <P>In relation to transport, the expectation is that the arrangements for transport to and from the school that apply at other times during the school year should also apply during the examination period.</P>
      <P>In the case of the candidates referred to by the Deputy, my Department received a request on 2 February 1999 for a change of examination centre.

Also, the data for 1990-91 and 1995-96 specifically excludes those pupils who left school and emigrated whereas the earlier data does not.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 382, 388, 389, 390 and 391 together.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme was established to enable long-term unemployed people to return to education and training programmes, with a view to enhancing their employability, without losing their social welfare entitlements. Participants on the scheme are paid a training allowance at least equal to their social welfare entitlement had they remained on the live register. They also retain their secondary benefit entitlements, such as rent allowances, butter and fuel vouchers. In addition, they are paid a travel allowance, if they reside more than three miles from the centre, and meal allowance.</P>
      <P>The programme, which is administered by the Vocational Education Committees, is subject to constant review by my Department in conjunction with vocational education committees. The regulations governing it are amended when deemed appropriate. Recent amendments to the regulations included: the equalisation of allowances payable to VTOS participants with these payable to participants in the back to education scheme of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs; and the removal of the participation limit of 10 per cent maximum for lone parents, disabled people and spouses.</P>
      <P>A study is at present being undertaken on how to make the scheme more effective in reaching older long-term unemployed people.</P>
      <P>The annual cost of the VTOS scheme is of the order of £25 million, which is used to pay training allowances, teachers' pay, books and materials. Expenditure on the scheme is broken down into pay and non-pay. Pay comprises the salaries of teachers and administrative costs. Non-pay includes training allowances, books, equipment, materials and overheads.</P>
      <P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following tables.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, institutions were very concerned about the implications for academic autonomy of certain proposals of the last Government. In all of this Government's dealing with institutions we have respected this idea. Crucially we have increased the ability of <Col N="781" /> institutions to focus on developing and protecting the quality of their courses.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Government has taken the unprecedented step of devolving the allocation of a £180 million research programme to an objective international review procedure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 394 together.</P>
      <P>At primary level there are at present 1,302 remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of schools served by each remedial teacher and the breakdown between full time and shared remedial teachers is not readily available. An inordinate amount of time would be involved in obtaining this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> The following table details the number of remedial posts allocated in each county, together with the number of schools and pupils who currently have access to this service at primary level.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have data on the number of pupils who receive remedial support at any given time. The service is targeted at those most in need of assistance, who would normally be assessed as being at or below the 10th percentile on standardised tests in basic literacy or numeracy, or their equivalents.</P>
    <P>The salary costs of the remedial service at primary level amount to approximately £32 million. Additional expenditure of approximately £260,000 is made in respect of material or equipment grants to remedial teachers at primary level.</P>
    <P>At second level there are 350 ex-quota remedial posts. In the voluntary secondary, community and comprehensive sectors, the posts are allocated to individual schools. In the vocational sector the posts are generally allocated on a VEC scheme basis and it is a matter for the relevant chief executive officer, with the agreement of the VEC, to allocate the resource to individual schools within the VEC scheme.</P>
    <P>The total enrolment in the second level schools which have access to an ex-quota remedial service is approximately 217,100.</P>
    <P>The salary costs of the remedial service at second level amount to approximately £8.7 million.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of my recent announcement that from next September a remedial teacher service will be available to all primary and second level schools.</P>

      <P>Second level schools generally liaise closely with their primary feeder schools in relation to pupil transfers. Most second level schools organise open days for senior primary pupils and their parents to visit the schools. This arrangement enables the primary pupils and their  parents to familiarise themselves with the schools and the programmes on offer and can be of great assistance in easing transition from first to second level.</P>
      <P>There is a particular need to encourage the transition from primary to second level of pupils from disadvantaged areas. This is best achieved by ensuring that such pupils and their parents have developed, during their period in the primary system, an appreciation of the importance of continued education to their children's long-term development.</P>
      <P>Children attending primary schools in disadvantaged areas are supported by a range of special programmes, including: the disadvantaged areas scheme, which currently covers an estimated 75,800 primary school pupils in 318 schools and involves the allocation of 294 concessionary teachers posts and special capitation funding of £2.3 million per annum; the home-school-community liaison scheme, which currently covers over 58,000 pupils in 225 primary schools and involves the allocation of 133 locally based co-ordinators working with parents and schools in the selected areas; the breaking the cycle of disadvantage initiative, which currently covers approximately 14,000 pupils in 156 schools and involves a special allocation of 121 teachers and special funding of approximately £700,000 per annum; the eight to 15 year old early school leavers programme which is targeted on approximately 2,000 pupils in 78 schools in 14 selected projected areas. A total of £3.62 million is being made available to this programme over the next two years.</P>
      <P>All of these programmes are targeted at supporting the participation  of disadvantaged children in the primary system and fostering the development of an appreciation of the value of continued participation in the education system.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> Post leaving certificate courses are funded as part of the overall teaching and non-pay resources issued by the Department towards the running costs of schools. A separate breakdown of the costs of the post leaving certificate programme is not available for the period prior to 1997, as the financial data prior to that includes other elements of the vocational preparation and training programme.</P>

      <P>The youthreach programme was introduced as a joint initiative by FÁS and the vocational education committees in 1989, to provide integrated education, vocational training and work experience for young people in the 15-18 year age group who had left school with either no qualifications or minimal qualifications.</P>
      <P>The numbers and cost of the programme in the VEC sector are set out in the following table. The figures up to the end of 1997 do not include training allowances paid to participants, as these were paid by FÁS up to 6 April 1998. The 1998 outlay on training allowances is for part of the year only.</P>

    <P>*Includes £3,643,166 allowances from 6 April 1998.</P>
    <P>A prescriptive approach as to the numbers on foundation and progression level was not adopted at central level, in order to ensure that local centres would have the maximum flexibility to respond to local need. The actual take-up of trainees on foundation and progression level is currently being gathered and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is available. Of those who complete youthreach, 70.6 per cent enter employment or further education or training. All youthreach trainees avail of certification options ranging from subjects in the junior certificate to City and Guilds, RSA and other providers, and certification from the National Council for <Col N="788" /> Vocational Awards. NCVA certification at foundation level was implemented nationally with effect from September 1997, and level 1 will be implemented nationally with effect from March 1999. Registrations and in-service training took place for this in 1998. The NCVA has an agreement with FÁS which provides for mutual recognition for progression purposes of the FÁS integrated assessment system foundation certificate and the NCVA foundation certificate. In addition, a number of youthreach centres are pursuing options under the leaving cert applied programme. In the VEC sector in 1977, 29 per cent of youthreach trainees had some form of junior cycle qualification on entering the programme, but this was usually less than five grade Ds. The remainder had left school with no qualifications.</P>
    <P>Twenty seven per cent of youthreach trainees are aged 15, 34 per cent are 16, 24 per cent are 17, and 15 per cent are 18 years or over.</P>

      <P>Community training workshops are funded on a contract basis by FÁS, and the numbers, outcomes from the programme, qualifications on entry and certification options available are matters for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to whom identical questions have been directed. The role of my Department in the matter is to allocate teaching hours through the vocational education committees as extra supports for participants with literacy and numeracy difficulties.</P>
