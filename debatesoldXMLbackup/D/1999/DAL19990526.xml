      <P>On a point of order, will you study the reasons given by the Taoiseach yesterday for not giving answers to political matters here in the Dáil on the grounds that these were for a tribunal, and the implication that the tribunal, in a political matter, is somehow superior to the Dáil which set it up, and that Ministers are now adopting a new doctrine of ministerial accountability which is not to account to the Dáil?</P>

      <P>On the order of business, has the Taoiseach considered the implications of the firemen's strike and that the Army has indicated an inability to deal adequately with the implications of that? Will any emergency provisions, involving legislation or otherwise, be made to deal with the risk to the lives of people after 3 June when this strike is due to commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Contingency arrangements have been put in place by the relevant Departments. That was done in recent weeks. This strike and dispute is totally unnecessary. The Labour Court has made a recommendation on the matter. The 1968 parity between the Garda and firemen is not at issue. The productivity issues that have been listed are for normal discussion. They appear to me to be matters that should be agreed locally. It is a matter of whether they are existing or new productivity issues and that does not justify a national strike. I respectfully suggest that the parties negotiate; the labour relations mechanisms of the State are available to them. The core issues on which people voted for strike action are not at issue, so it is rather peculiar that we could have a national strike when the issues have been addressed and should be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Defence Forces and the agencies have made the arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach will visit some of the fire stations to see whether the strike is justified on the basis of what has failed to be worked out. Many stations are in a bad condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>A promise was given 18 months ago that the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill would be published in late 1998. The Government is in court on this matter and it is not giving a good example when it does not consider going to court as&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill be published? Given that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, will meet the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland at 11 a.m., will the Taoiseach give the House some information on that Bill which was at an advanced stage in November 1997? Will the Dáil be given news of the Bill before a press conference hears about it? When will the Bill be published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some movement on legislation in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Will the Taoiseach restore the national parks and historic properties Bill to the legislative agenda? The Bill was removed from the list because of other priorities. Instead of asking the Taoiseach, I can inform him that the Broadcasting Bill will be published tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am sure you will join me in congratulating the Irish Haemophilia Society for finally getting the Government to agree to the terms of reference for the tribunal of inquiry.

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated a difficulty in the past with the vague terminology used by the Taoiseach. In this instance there has been a two and a half year wait. Will he be more specific in terms of what would appear to be a relatively simple motion to be put to the House which all Members will wish to support soon. Will the Taoiseach specify when we can expect to be in a position to do so? This is a very important issue.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach was at the concert. There seemed to be no measures in place to keep the traffic moving and to separate those going to the concert from normal traffic. People were delayed for three hours. Will the road traffic legislation include measures to ensure that necessary resources are made available to the Garda in the case of major events? Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a role in this matter also.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation has its origins in the British-Irish Agreement and the subsequent amendment of the Constitution effected by the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1998. The signing of the Act by the President, following its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas and its approval by the people, added a new section &ndash; section 7 &ndash; to Article 29 of the Constitution. This provides that the State may agree to be bound by the Agreement, contains consequential provisions to enable the institutions established under the Agreement to function and, critically, provides for the insertion of a mechanism whereby new Articles 2 and 3 can be substituted <Col N="729" /> for the existing Articles and a new section 8 inserted into Article 29 on the entry into force of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Article 29.7.5 contains a mechanism whereby, if the British-Irish Agreement does not enter into force and the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution are therefore not made, the whole of the new section 7 ceases to have effect after 12 months. As the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act was enacted on 3 June 1998, the amendment would not be effective after 2 June 1999 in the absence of legislative action by the Oireachtas. However, there was provision in section 29.7.5 for an extension of the 12 month period by legislation &ldquo;for such longer period as may be provided by law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As Members will know, the British-Irish Agreement has regrettably not yet entered into force and it is clear it will not come into force by 2 June. Consequently, it will not be possible for the Government to make the declaration envisaged in Article 29.7.3 within that timeframe. Accordingly, the Government now considers it necessary to seek the approval of the House for the extension of the 12 month timeframe by an additional 12 month period. Such an extension is necessary if Article 29.7 and consequently the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 is not to lapse thereby making it impossible to implement the Agreement, the constitutional and institutional aspects of which are interlocking.</P>
    <P>The Government has opted for a clearcut 12 month extension. It might be possible to make a case for a one month extension by reference to the 30 June deadline, but this would be very tight and would involve a risk of having to return to the Houses again before the summer recess. The incidence of the recess argues against a three month extension, so the Government has taken the view that a 12 month period is preferable. It is the normal roll-over period for any temporary provision. There are other provisions in the Agreement which involve periods of two years, the expiry of which would broadly coincide with the expiry of the extension now proposed.</P>
    <P>This promised extension is not an indication of failure of the Agreement. The possibility of needing it was part of the Agreement. Nor is it to be taken as a signal that the Government believes 12 months will be needed to overcome current difficulties. On the contrary, our efforts are focused on a much shorter timeframe. The extension is rather a way to facilitate further dialogue with all parties to reach an all-inclusive settlement in Northern Ireland and put an end, once and for all, to the violence and political instability with which we have lived for so long. As Deputies will know, the deadline of 30 June has been set for devolution of power to the Northern Ireland Assembly. We are working to achieve this.</P>
    <P>All parties are being asked to go as far as they can and then a little further to reach agreement on issues which are difficult for them and those they represent. For the Agreement to work, it is critically important that they have the backing of <Col N="730" /> their constituents in Northern Ireland. I am heartened by the genuine efforts being made to achieve this, but further strenuous efforts need to be made. In presenting this legislation providing for an additional timeframe of 12 months, the Government is ensuring there will not be legal impediments to bringing the Agreement into force as soon as the current intensive efforts are successful.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand the Bill will not delay for 12 months the entry into force of the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 and the addition of the new paragraph 8 to Article 29. The Bill proposes an extension of time within which the Government can make the declaration envisaged in Article 29.7.3. Once the basis was established for making the declaration through the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement, the Government would be obliged under the Agreement to make the declaration without delay and the relevant amendments to the Constitution would then enter into force forthwith.</P>
    <P>What we propose fully preserves the conditionality and link which was incorporated in what the people approved in the referendum last year. An additional 12 months is provided for the Government to make the relevant declaration, but it can still only be made when the Agreement enters into force, triggering the operation of all the institutions and bodies for which it provides, including the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks and months on a regular basis I have kept the House informed of developments and the situation regarding the formation of the Executive. I did so most recently in the House yesterday and there is little I can add to that. Rather I want to focus on the advances which have occurred. Deputies will be aware of the progress which has been made regarding the implementation of the institutional and other arrangements provided for in the Agreement. The necessary legislation regarding constitutional change and the establishment of the institutions and bodies provided for in the Good Friday Agreement has been enacted at Westminster and in the Oireachtas. This includes the legislation on implementation bodies following the agreement reached last December on the areas for these bodies and also the areas for co-operation using existing mechanisms for implementation and the subsequent agreements on the detailed remits and structures of the implementation bodies. More recently, work has been advanced on other aspects of the functioning of these bodies and also on the <i>modus operandi</i> of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made on a number of human rights areas which are important to confidence building in the divided communities in Northern Ireland. A human rights commission has been appointed in the North headed by a highly and widely respected chairperson. The Bill to establish a human rights commission in this jurisdiction, which is being drafted on a priority basis, <Col N="731" /> based on proposals approved by the Government, will take account of the views of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. The Bill, which in some respects will go further than the provisions of the British Northern Ireland Act, 1998, establishing the Northern Ireland Commission, is expected to be published soon.</P>
    <P>In regard to equality legislation, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has set September next as the target for implementation of the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The Act prohibits discrimination in employment on nine distinct grounds: gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. In March, the Minister announced arrangements for the equality infrastructure being put in place to underpin employment equality and equal status legislation. The equality infrastructure which he announced and which was established under the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, consists of two new bodies: the Equality Authority which will replace the existing Employment Equality Agency and the Office of Director of Equality Investigations to provide a forum of first redress. The Equality Authority was appointed by the Minister on a designated basis in March.</P>
    <P>After enactment of the equal status legislation, the remit of these two bodies will be broadened beyond the employment equality area to cover matters under the Equal Status Bill. The Bill, which has completed Second Stage, is a comprehensive measure to promote equality and tackle discrimination in our society in the non-employment sphere. In February, the Government approved proposals for the ratification of the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities &ndash; it has now been formally ratified &ndash; to coincide with ceremonies relating to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Council of Europe. We are on target for the publication of the Irish nationality and citizenship legislation in this session.</P>
    <P>In the Good Friday Agreement, the Government agreed, taking account of the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and the Report of the Constitution Review Group, to bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights. These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights. Follow-up on these commitments has been taken forward by an interdepartmental working group and the question of incorporation of the ECHR is being further examined in this context.</P>
    <P>In both jurisdictions, large numbers of prisoners have been released. In the North the Patten Commission on the reform of policing is well <Col N="732" /> advanced in its work, as is the separate review of the criminal justice system. The process of normalisation of security has progressed significantly, with the dismantling and evacuation of forts and other installations and the discontinuation of army patrols over large areas. I am particularly pleased that following representations from the Government, Cumann Lúthchleas Gael and other sources, the British Army and the RUC will vacate the GAA grounds in Crossmaglen, the occupation of which has for so long been a running sore.</P>
    <P>We should acknowledge the valuable contribution the ceasefires of republican and loyalist paramilitary organisations have made. I also welcome the IRA's willingness to facilitate the return of the bodies of the 'disappeared' to their families, where results should now follow the enactment of the relevant limited immunity legislation in both jurisdictions. The British Act is expected to become law tomorrow and our own legislation is already in force. I hope there will finally be closure for the families in the cases which may be near to resolution, these families who have suffered for far too long. Also welcome are the efforts to replace the barbaric system of punishment beatings with a new system of restorative justice and the support this has been receiving from America.</P>
    <P>These are real changes which will assist the people of Northern Ireland in breaking down the barriers of sectarianism, while recognising the rights of each community to respect its traditions and ethos. In addition , there has been substantial change in the political atmosphere across all parties. Meetings between Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party are now routine. Meetings to consider North-South matters are no longer viewed with the same suspicion by Unionists. Political contacts and dialogue are taking place in a better atmosphere than ever before and there is a better understanding on all sides of the pressures that each side faces.</P>
    <P>Difficulties remain, however, and difficult issues which could exacerbate the situation subsist. There is a very worrying pattern of sectarian violence against Catholics across northern and eastern parts of Northern Ireland. There has been the horrific murder of Rosemary Nelson and the issues of concern to which it gives rise. The continuing sectarian harassment and intimidation of the people of the Garvaghy Road is entirely unacceptable. Direct dialogue between residents and the Orange Order is the obvious way forward, but, whether direct or indirect, dialogue is essential. The sense of threat and of siege that arises from sectarian attacks on the Nationalist communities must be lifted, with a focus on the conditions needed not only to restore normal rights of freedom of movement and freedom from harassment but also to improve community relations.</P>
    <P>If dialogue can take place between Unionists and Nationalists, republicans and loyalists at all levels, then the Orange Order can speak to the <Col N="733" /> communities, through which it desires to march. The principle of consent applies to that situation as much as it does to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. The principle of equality, so central to the Good Friday Agreement, must also apply. There are many decent members of the Orange Order and the Church of Ireland who have taken a principled stand against the unacceptable behaviour of some elements in Portadown and I welcome the resolution passed at the General Synod of the Church of Ireland. No genuine cultural identity should be aggressive or threatening towards those who do not share it.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement offers a truly historic opportunity for a beginning of new relationships on this island and between Ireland and Britain. It is also the realisation of many years of commitment and effort by many people to the cause of peace. Constitutional change is part of that comprehensive settlement and the necessity for it has been fully accepted by the people North and South. The Agreement is a balanced settlement, involving agreed changes in both Irish and British constitutional law, based on the principles of self-determination and consent. These changes reinforce the principle that in Ireland, North and South, it is the people who are sovereign. The Agreement provides for a peaceful method of resolving fundamental differences in the future, while creating a basis for practical partnership and co-operation now.</P>
    <P>As I stated in the past, the reformulation of Articles 2, 3 and 29 reflects modern, progressive Republican thought that is truly pluralist and keeps faith with the inclusive tradition of Irish nationalism which stems from Wolfe Tone and the United Irishmen. The Bill before the House is necessary to maintain the State's capacity to give effect to the reformulated Articles, which, as approved by the people, remain a vital element in the interrelated whole that is the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the full implementation of that Agreement in all of its aspects remains the key priority of the Government. We are working closely and unremittingly with the British Government and the pro-Agreement parties to achieve this objective. It is the duty of everyone who supports the Agreement to ensure that it works. While we must recognise and accept each other's difficulties, our focus must remain on the implementation of the Agreement and all its provisions.</P>
    <P>The Government appreciates the support received from all parties in this House on Northern Ireland matters, including the expeditious passage of this vital legislation. This is a measure of how well our democracy has developed since independence. We, as members of different parties, have individual policies and aspirations, but we can come together to support initiatives which are critical to the common good of our people, North and South. This is the same co-operative spirit which is now emerging in Northern Ireland. I am confident <Col N="734" /> that we will bring an end to the conflict and make a reality of the new dispensation that the Good Friday Agreement heralded.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the upsurge in loyalist violence against Catholics. The day before yesterday, security forces were quoted as linking the UFF to the Friday night gun attack in which a Catholic community worker was shot as he left a 14 year old girl back to her home in the Shankill Road area. The <i>Irish News</i> reported that the man targeted in the failed attack, 49 year old Frank Pettigrew, claimed that six months ago RUC officers threatened that he would be killed by loyalists unless he agreed to inform on IRA members. That claim has been denied by the RUC.</P>
      <P>There is a sense within the community that individuals or elements of some, if not all, of the loyalist paramilitary organisations are now involved in attacks upon vulnerable Catholic communities and on the Nationalist community in general. The way the RUC deals with this threat will have considerable influence on the attitude of the minority community to policing matters. There is a responsibility on the Irish and British Governments to give their full security assessment with regard to the nature and significance of these attacks.</P>
      <P>The reform of policing in Northern Ireland is an urgent issue and it forms part of the Good Friday Agreement. Police reform is not a pre-condition to any other part of the Agreement. However, it is an integral part of the Agreement as a whole and also of the political obligation that underpins it. The choreography of the Agreement must include substantial progress on RUC reform.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation before the House. The extension of time by 12 months is a prudent measure. The negotiators have worked hard and although agreement has not yet been reached, a level of trust has been built up between individuals which few would have thought possible several months ago. A solution can be found. The longer the guns remain silent, the more manageable the decommissioning issue becomes. In that sense, the passage of time is a positive and not, as sometimes presented, a negative.</P>
      <P>I understand the impatience of prime ministers, but I warn against the false hopes and fears that could be engendered by artificial deadlines. I hope the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister know exactly what they intend to do and say if the recently announced 30 June deadline is not met. I am concerned that they may not have an adequate contingency plan. I address these remarks directly to the Taoiseach. Without an adequate contingency plan, it would be better that a deadline such as the proposed 30 June deadline, were not made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation provides for an extension of 12 months for the constitutional change. There can be an outcome to the talks, yet the Taoiseach and <Col N="735" /> the British Prime Minister have decided on an extension of a little over a month, up to 30 June for the talks. How do these two different extensions of time or deadlines interact with one another? This question must be asked and, if possible, the Taoiseach must answer it. The talks participants should know exactly their options and choices. Uncertainty is not positive in this situation and the contradiction between the 12 month deadline in the legislation and the 30 June deadline for the talks has not been explained adequately by the Taoiseach either at Question Time yesterday or in his speech today. I do not know why there is one deadline of 12 months and another of one month.</P>
    <P>One respected newspaper columnist, Mr. Paul Bew, yesterday, reflecting on the change in Irish Government policy that took place when the Hillsborough Declaration was replaced by the more recent Downing Street formula said:</P>
    <P>The problem is that the world is beginning to believe that we are witnessing a radical policy reversal and that the possibility of any IRA decommissioning is fast receding. Why was such an impression allowed to gain ground?</P>
    <P>Last Sunday another columnist asked:</P>
    <P>And what are the political players to make of the Governments who in the space of a few weeks have veered from the certitudes of Hillsborough for an uncompromising demand for some form of IRA decommissioning to a proposal at Downing Street which appears to have all but removed that issue from the agenda?</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister have been prudent to allow such an impression to be created in the minds of intelligent observers, such as the two columnists I have quoted.</P>
    <P>While canvassing in Dublin's inner city for the local elections last week I met a woman who told me she had been intimidated by a paramilitary organisation not to be a witness in a particular court case. She still lives in fear for her children and herself. She asked me to help with rehousing because of her fear of the activities of this paramilitary organisation here in Dublin, less than two miles from this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>She named it and the individuals involved. Those who think that putting the guns and bombs of the IRA, the UVF and the UDA beyond use is an artificial hurdle created by malicious Unionists or meddling Tories simply to torture Sinn Féin might reflect on the example I have quoted of what I was told last week within two miles of this building. They might also reflect, as they brush decommissioning aside as some artificial issue invented to cause trouble, on what happened in South Africa where paramilitary weapons were not decommissioned at the time of <Col N="736" /> the political settlement and decommissioning was not part of the political settlement.</P>
      <P>In South Africa a demoralised police force stands aside while a vigilante organisation with 10,000 paid-up members stages savage public beatings of suspected criminals. The Director of Public Prosecutions of South Africa has said &ldquo;Our people live in agony, tormented by criminals and thugs who have taken over our townships and suburbs&rdquo;. If parties enter the Executive in Northern Ireland without decommissioning being committed to in a firm and believable way this will be interpreted as the political system giving <i>de facto</i> legitimation to private armies.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental element of democracy that democratic and constitutional authorities alone should have a monopoly of the legitimate use of force. Indeed, that is provided for explicitly in the Constitution. The idea that bodies such as the IRA, the UDA and the UVF controlling commercially valuable stocks of bombs and guns will fade away in a mist of goodwill, that would be created by Executive power-sharing and North-South bodies, seems a trifle naive to me. Yet, it is an assumption that is being made increasingly by intelligent people, not just writing in the columns of our newspapers but elsewhere. Is there a real basis for this assumption that these organisations with their valuable stocks of guns and bombs will gradually disappear in an atmosphere of political goodwill? If there is a basis for the assumption I would like to know what it is. I would like to hear the evidence for that assumption because those who advance it, or make proposals based on that assumption, should be explicit.</P>
      <P>It is fair to point out that a gesture of decommissioning is meaningless in itself. It is a commitment to a process of putting bombs and guns beyond use that is really important. Such a commitment is part of the Good Friday Agreement no matter how it is read. Would Martin McGuinness as a Sinn Féin member in a Belfast government be better able to deliver such a commitment to putting bombs and guns beyond use than Martin McGuinness as a leading member of Sinn Féin in the Assembly, who is apparently unable to do so? If the proposition we are asked to accept is that as a minister Martin McGuinness will be able to get the IRA to do things that he cannot as an Assembly member, I would like to hear the evidence for the assumption. If Sinn Féin cannot speak for the IRA now when Sinn Féin is out of government will Sinn Féin in government be able to do more? If that is the proposition we are asked to believe we should hear the evidence.</P>
      <P>This issue is the nub of the current negotiations being undertaken by the Irish and British Governments. The issues at stake are important to the fundamental quality of Irish democracy in the new millennium. It is not just a northern issue, it is fundamental to this State also and I have given an illustration from this city to indicate so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> The Taoiseach said yesterday that in putting forward the Hillsborough Declaration the two Governments had gone, as he put it, outside the Agreement. I do not accept this interpretation by the Taoiseach of the Good Friday Agreement. I ask him to explain it in his response to this debate. As a precursor to their admission to the talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement, all parties, including the Progressive Unionist Party, the Ulster Democratic Party and Sinn Féin, solemnly signified their acceptance of the Mitchell principles. One of the Mitchell principles they signed up to before the talks began is that the parties affirm their total and absolute commitment to &ldquo;the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations&rdquo; and &ldquo;that the parties give their total and absolute commitment to agree that such disarmament must be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent commission&rdquo;. A similar passage in the Hillsborough Declaration states:</P>
    <P>There is agreement among all parties that decommissioning of weapons is not a precondition but is an obligation deriving from their commitment in the Agreement and that it should take place within the timetable envisaged in the Agreement and through the efforts of the independent international commission on decommissioning.</P>
    <P>That is almost an exact reproduction of the sentiments of the Mitchell principles. At Hillsborough the Taoiseach said that decommissioning was an obligation on the parties deriving from their commitment in the Agreement. Yet, yesterday in the Dáil he said that this was outside the Agreement. How can something which derives from a commitment in the Agreement also be outside it?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should reread the Mitchell principles. I ask him to confirm what status he believes the Mitchell principles have in reference to the Good Friday Agreement. Is it his view that the Mitchell principles no longer apply and are completely erased by the Good Friday Agreement or does he agree that the principles are the cornerstone of the entire political process and the Good Friday Agreement can only be read in conjunction with them? If the Mitchell principles are integral to the Good Friday Agreement, how can the Taoiseach possibly argue, as Sinn Féin does, that there is no obligation to start decommissioning in the Good Friday Agreement? There is such an obligation, but it has not been met. It has not even been accepted by Sinn Féin, the Progressive Unionist Party or the Ulster Democratic Party. They are washing their hands now of the Mitchell principles and the absolute commitments they gave when they signed up to them. This is not good enough. For me and all democrats, the Mitchell principles are fundamental.</P>
    <P>These are difficult questions. The Taoiseach and others have a difficult job to do in the negotiations. I accept the Taoiseach is doing his best. Hindsight is a more exact science than practical politics and I freely admit that I am applying <Col N="738" /> hindsight to the difference I see between the Hillsborough Declaration and the Downing Street formula. However, that is my job and I would not be doing it if I did not draw attention to the fact that the Downing Street statement and the Hillsborough Declaration are radically different. I am doing my job without in any sense questioning the Taoiseach's commitment or talent with regard to this matter to which he is applying himself 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>As we seek a diplomatic solution to a real difficulty, we should not forget that since 1969, nine members of the Garda Síochána have been killed by paramilitary guns. Many more members of the Garda Síochána have been killed by paramilitary guns than by any other method or motive. The requirement to get those guns, which could kill more gardaí in the future, out of harm's way is not a mere verbalisation that can be dissolved by linguistic sophistry. We need to be rid of these engines of death once and for all.</P>
    <P>This responsibility and concern is shared by all the major parties in the House. It is not something that we as democrats can sub-contract to any political leader or Prime Minister outside this jurisdiction because, ultimately, we in this House must live with the use to which guns in the Thirty-two Counties might be put. The guns and bombs are there; they are not in London, the north of England or the Continent of Europe. This democracy is threatened more than any other by the existence of large valuable and commercially saleable stocks of weaponry on this island.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for getting rid of those guns cannot be sub-contracted by us to Prime Minister Tony Blair or Mr. David Trimble. It is a matter for us. The Taoiseach accepts this point; his article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> indicated that was the case. However, the Downing Street formula, in the way in which it departs from the Hillsborough Declaration, does not appear to reflect that as clearly as perhaps it should. This has nothing to do with Unionists or the British, it has to do with us and the quality of our democracy.</P>
    <P>Guns, bombs and private armies of whatever political colour or sectarian origin have no place in our democracy. This is a fundamental point, not a sophism. We must speak clearly about this point in the House. I always do so and I wish others who comment on the Northern issue would speak as clearly. We cannot take this for granted given that, since 1969, nine gardaí have been killed by paramilitaries. It is our business as democrats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say without fear of contradiction that none of us in Government or Opposition is pleased to be debating this issue today. Unfortunately, the proposal before the House arises directly from the failure of the political leaders in Northern Ireland to ensure the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement within its first year. However, such a situation is not calamitous. Neither I nor my party believe that the bringing forward of this Bill needs to <Col N="739" /> reflect on the ultimate prospect for success of the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
      <P>The proposals are necessitated by the legal mechanisms contained in the proposals endorsed by the people by referendum. Consequently, the Bill does not and cannot recognise how much work has been done between the passing of that referendum and today. It cannot recognise the progress made on issues such as the election of the First and Deputy First Minister, the agreement on North-South bodies or prisoner releases and human rights. I am glad the Taoiseach put on record some of the progress that has been made. However, I share Deputy Bruton's concern about the issue of guns and policing North and South, but particularly in the North of Ireland, and our expectations that are vested in the Patton report.</P>
      <P>The peace process appeared to run aground before but at each stage it has been rescued by last minute agreement and initiatives. Let it be so in this case also. However, there is little use pretending that the current difficulties are not among the most difficult we have faced since the beginning of the process. As such, I commend the intense efforts being undertaken by the two Governments and the Northern political parties to resolve the outstanding issues. We should never take that effort for granted.</P>
      <P>However, the hard work undertaken since, including the preparations prior to the Hillsborough Declaration, only serve to indicate further the difficult situation in which we now find ourselves. I do not mean to be critical but as the Governments alternate between applying pressure for movement on Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionists Party to the current impasse, the focus and united direction which epitomised the work of the Governments at their most influential have been lacking. I share Deputy Bruton's concern that the Governments know exactly what they will do in advance of doing it and that the briefings, statements and public support from spokespersons on behalf of the Governments show that they are singing not only from the same hymn sheet but also in harmony. For my part, I find that what I have said about the situation has not changed over the past month. I would rather we had moved on.</P>
      <P>Some months ago the problem was defined as there being on one side an attempt to insert into the Agreement a clause which is not there, namely, prior decommissioning, and on the other an attempt to deny the existence of the clause which made decommissioning necessary by May 2000. The problem has not changed. Trust, or more precisely, a lack of it, is at the heart of the problem. However, I wonder too if there is a lack of political nous. Given the history of the past 30 years, it is perhaps too much to expect trust between the major players on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I detect a resistance among some politicians to their fate. This fate is one of mutual reliance and dependence. If Mr. David Trimble needs Mr. Gerry Adams to make the Agreement <Col N="740" /> work and vindicate decisions he made this time 12 months ago, and <i>vice versa</i>, so too do the Ulster Unionist assembly party require the assembly party of Sinn Féin and the other pro-Agreement parties. Such mutual dependence is now a political reality.</P>
    <P>From such an acceptance could come two things: on the republican side, an appreciation why &ndash; for party political reasons and to develop the trust in their community to take the difficult steps ahead &ndash; the destruction of weapons that they perceive as having been used against their community is so symbolically important to Unionism; on the other side, Unionists might come closer to understand the difficulties already encountered by the republican movement in selling this process to their supporters, however unreasonable their position might be.</P>
    <P>They might understand too why it is so important that the republican movement acts as one on this issue. We have already seen to our cost at Omagh the extent to which dissident republicans are prepared to go to destroy this process and the current republican leadership with it. Dissident republicans are not alone &ndash; loyalist extremists seem increasingly taken with a strategy the sole design of which seems to be to provoke a reaction from mainstream republicanism, with the desired outcome of the destruction of the Agreement. The murder of Rosemary Nelson, the continuation of punishment attacks and increased targeting by paramilitaries are all reminders that we cannot afford this process to fail. A return to the nightmare of the last 30 years cannot be contemplated. Politics would be seen and be deemed to have failed. The democratic vacuum that gave rise to this conflict in the first place would return, with all the consequences we deplore and fear.</P>
    <P>There is light on the horizon. Recent opinion polls have seemed to suggest that support for the Agreement is now running at even higher levels than when the North and South referenda were held. The durability of that desire for progress and the final chapter on the Northern troubles remains palpable. However, the same polls indicated pessimism that the current impasse could be resolved. It seems to me that in effect the public were putting it up to their politicians. The people continue to support the politicians' work but they do not believe they have the capacity to deliver. Will any of the Northern politicians have the courage to prove them wrong?</P>
    <P>The respective positions of the UUP and the republican movement have remained unaltered and I referred to the work of the two Governments earlier. There are two separate proposals on the table from the SDLP, both of which centre on its support for the removal of Sinn Féin from the Executive if the republican movement's obligations on decommissioning by May 2000 are not fulfilled.</P>
    <P>What has been noticeably absent, however, is suggestions from the two parties to the impasse as to how they see the difficulties being resolved, <Col N="741" /> although there seems to be a chink of light from the Unionists this morning. Until now, in public at least, Sinn Féin, the IRA Army Council and the Ulster Unionist Party remain wedded to their original positions. I can only hope a more constructive attitude is being adopted behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the end of June deadline represents an attempt on behalf of the two Governments to concentrate minds. It no doubt represents the difficulties in sustaining the direct and personal involvement of the British Prime Minister over a further protracted period of time and the impending problem at Drumcree and the marching season. Again, we cannot take for granted the continued high level of personal involvement by the British Prime Minister on this issue. There may come a time when Mr. Blair decides that if the parties to the problem are not interested in a resolution, he is not in a position to pursue it further. That fact and the not unreasonable fear that if the Agreement is parked for a few months there may be no Agreement to return to, has obviously concentrated minds. Either way it is a high-risk strategy.</P>
    <P>As I see it, two events are creating most of the problems. No one underestimates the tension surrounding the Drumcree stand-off. I welcome the recent attempts to bring the two sides together. The refusal of the Orange Order to enter into dialogue directly with the residents is inexcusable but not surprising. Drumcree and the overall political position are inextricably linked. Those who support the Agreement and who recognise the threat posed to it by a repeat of last year's events have a particular obligation to resolve the issue.</P>
    <P>Understandably there is some concern within the Unionist camp, in particular about the outcome of the European elections. On that issue, Dr. Paisley may win a battle or two but he cannot be allowed to win the war; while that terminology is perhaps inappropriate to the history of these islands, the meaning is clear. Dr. Paisley's politics offer nothing to the people of Northern Ireland or the future of this island.</P>
    <P>However, neither do guns and central to the current impasse is the fear that guns used before can be used again. The important element is that guns remain silent but if the intention is to keep them silent what happens to them should not be important. Their destruction, in a fashion compliant with an Agreement endorsed by an all-Ireland election for the first time since 1918, should not become an obstacle to the single biggest achievement of the republican movement in its history.</P>
    <P>Reports in this morning's newspapers and radio programmes quoting a statement from the UUP Assembly party are welcome and should be taken up constructively by Sinn Fein, the IRA Army Council and the two Governments. Assuming the reports are accurate, and I have no reason to doubt them, the statement seems a reasonable advance on previous UUP positions. I await further developments on this issue and per<Col N="742" /> haps the Taoiseach, in his reply, could update us on any information the Government may have about the statement attributed to the UUP, in particular, Mr. Dermot Nesbitt.</P>
    <P>My party will support this Bill and in line with our overall support for the Government on Northern Ireland we will not table amendments. I take this opportunity to set out my one reservation to the Bill, namely, the extension of the period for the coming into force of the new Articles 2 and 3 by a year, side by side with the 30 June timetable for agreement between the parties on a scenario in which the d'Hondt mechanism can be triggered. Deputy John Bruton referred to this matter and it is the subject of an amendment to come before us in due course. In his reply on Second Stage I ask the Taoiseach to outline more substantially than in his opening contribution, the reason why the option of a full 12 months is being taken, as it is in marked contrast to the 30 June deadline. He addressed the issue in part but greater elaboration is required.</P>
    <P>In any event, the Taoiseach can be assured of my party's continued support for the resolution of this issue, bearing in mind the work done by my party since the onset of the Troubles in 1969, particularly in formulating the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, more recently, the work done by my immediate predecessor, Deputy Spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation has become necessary because the Government finds itself unable to declare, in accordance with Article 29.7 of the Constitution, that the State has become obliged under the Good Friday Agreement to give effect to the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 Constitution contained in that Agreement. While such a situation was anticipated in the wording of Article 29.7, adopted by the people in a referendum held in the 26 Counties a year ago, few anticipated that 12 months on we would be faced with the scenario now before us in the closing days of this month.</P>
      <P>This time last year a tide of hope and expectation swept the country in the wake of the Good Friday Agreement. Having watched the tortuous progress of the negotiations there was a great sense of achievement when they concluded on Good Friday. There was a sense that a new era had begun.</P>
      <P>A year later the Good Friday Agreement is stalled and its future is in question. The process of stalling began soon after the conclusion of the Agreement. Once the referenda and the assembly elections were over the Ulster Unionist Party dug itself into a trench from which it has yet to emerge. Indeed, it has kept digging. The UUP has successfully blocked the implementation of the Agreement, allowing only the establishment of the assembly and the appointment of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister but preventing the establishment of all the other key institutions agreed on Good Friday 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This crisis for the Agreement did not begin last week. We need only look at the series of dead<Col N="743" /> lines which have been missed because of the obstruction of the Ulster Unionist Party. The shadow Executive was to have been established in July 1998; the all-Ireland Ministerial Council was to have met and completed its work programme by 31 October 1998; the d'Hondt mechanism was to have been triggered on 10 March, it was then to have been triggered on the week beginning 29 March and Good Friday, 2 April, was yet another missed deadline. The assembly is in a state of limbo and can only meet when told to do so by the British Government. There is no shadow Executive, no all-Ireland Ministerial Council and the d'Hondt mechanism has yet to be triggered.</P>
    <P>We are in this crisis because the Ulster Unionist Party has attempted to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement, inserting the precondition of decommissioning of IRA weapons prior to Sinn Féin's entry to the Executive. Sinn Féin has repeatedly made clear this is a precondition which we cannot deliver. More importantly, it is a requirement we should not be asked to fulfil because it does not form part of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement has been correctly described as a contract between political opponents. There is an absence of mutual trust and confidence and it is vital, therefore, that the letter of the Agreement is applied. The application of the letter of the Agreement is the contractual obligation entered into by all parties to it. This obligation was endorsed by referendums in both jurisdictions a year ago. The only way to build trust and confidence between the political opponents who concluded the Agreement is for them to fulfil their contract with each other and with the electorate.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what some speakers would have the public believe, Sinn Féin has fully honoured its part of the contract. We have fulfilled all our obligations under the Agreement. Our party and the republican electorate is, therefore, very angry and dismayed that the Agreement freely entered into by the parties, and endorsed by the people, has been virtually dismissed.</P>
    <P>Tá gach dualgas ar Shinn Fhéin faoin gComhaontú seo comhlíonta againn. Bhí orainn ár mBunreacht a athrú, agus polasaithe bunúsacha a bhí againn le blianta fada, a chur ar leataobh chun tacú leis an Chomhaontú. Rinneamar sin mar bhí dóchas againn &ndash; mar a bhí ag muintir na hÉireann &ndash; go mbeadh dul chun cinn ann, go mbeadh an Comhaontú seo i bhfeidhm go luath agus go mbeadh deis againn uile polaitíocht nua a chruthú ar an oileán seo. Bliain ina dhiaidh sin táimid fós ag fanacht. Tá toil mhuintir na hÉireann á shéanadh ag na hAontachtóirí.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin amended key sections of its constitution to allow our elected representatives to participate in the Six County assembly. We never wanted such an assembly. It was not a demand of Nationalist Ireland; it was certainly never a demand of republican Ireland. We also urged a yes vote in the referendum, which made funda<Col N="744" /> mental changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. They were issues on which we had campaigned for many years and to which others had more than a warm regard over a prolonged period of time. For many republicans, both inside and outside our party, the amendment of these Articles was repugnant to their beliefs. However, Sinn Féin took a collective decision. We abided by it and implemented it.</P>
    <P>We did all this in good faith because we believed the Good Friday Agreement was the route to political progress on our island. The Agreement falls short of what republicans desire, even in the short-term, but it is nevertheless a historic accommodation which we reached in good faith with our political opponents. When we made fundamental compromises we had every right to expect that the Good Friday Agreement would be implemented in good faith. That has not happened. David Trimble put the compromises made by republicans into his pocket and then tried to rewrite the Agreement. Sinn Féin is not prepared to see the compromises we made in good faith pocketed or binned and the agreement we reached in good faith turned on its head.</P>
    <P>The context in which the Good Friday Agreement has been allowed to wither could hardly be worse. The siege of the Garvaghy Road community has been continuous and unrelenting since last summer. There has been a long series of attacks by Loyalist paramilitaries, including the murder of solicitor Rosemary Nelson, the legal representative of the Garvaghy Road community. The latest was a bomb attack last week on a pub in the Falls Road which could easily have caused multiple deaths and injuries.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that sectarian loyalism is poised to fill the political vacuum caused by the failure of mainstream Unionism to implement the Good Friday Agreement. It is vital, therefore, that what was agreed on Good Friday is put in place. Sinn Féin continues to deal in good faith with all the parties and both Governments to find a viable way forward within the terms of the Agreement. This we will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. What we cannot and will not do is to return to the politics of broken agreements and broken promises. We have been down that road as a nation too many times before.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill, I have put down an amendment which seeks to delete the cited period &ldquo;of 24 months&rdquo; and substitutes &ldquo;up to an including 30 June 1999&rdquo;. That is the deadline now set by the Governments for definite progress on the implementation of the Agreement. I do not agree that the period during which the Governments' declaration can be made should be extended beyond that date. The amended Articles 2 and 3 were adopted by the people in a referendum last year on the basis that the Agreement would be implemented in due time. Are we to wait two and possibly three or four years for that to happen?</P>
    <P>I have outlined the context in which I am taking this position. The compromises made by republicans and Nationalists to achieve the Good <Col N="745" /> Friday Agreement have been taken for granted, including by voices in this House. Not least of those compromises was the adoption by the people in this jurisdiction of fundamental changes to the Constitution. Those changes were not made unconditionally. They depend entirely on the implementation of the Agreement within a specific timeframe. The time period was included to guard against just such a scenario which now faces us, that is, obstruction and delay which, if allowed to continue, will set at naught the efforts and accommodations made over the past few years. While I have tabled an amendment and believe that if the new deadline set by the two Governments is to be taken seriously, that the Government here should adopt and support same, I will not, however, in the event of the Bill as tabled being put, oppose it, but do now record my decision to abstain for the reasons already stated.</P>
    <P>I recognise and emphasise that it is not only a personal statement but one representative of my party leadership and our activists at all tiers of Sinn Féin throughout the length and breadth of this island, that we must proceed at all times in a spirit of political accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal is as significant in its own way as the original proposal to give effect to the Good Friday Agreement. It is significant in the sense that it enables all sides of this House to demonstrate once again that we are united in a common cause based on no other interest or concern than a constant and continuing goodwill and commitment to bring about not only a resolution of the problems that may still need to be resolved but, much more significantly, to open up the major potential of a new era of opportunity and progress within the north of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the tone of this debate, just as the tone of the debate introducing this matter more than12 months ago, is one of measured concern and impatience. We are not impatient with those who may have problems to resolve because that is not the way we would like our view to be understood, although we may be impatient about that as well. Our impatience is born of something deeper and more vital. It is the impatience of political representatives who recognise the major potential for all of the people of Ireland, particularly the besieged people in the north of Ireland who have not been allowed over the years to enjoy the challenge and opportunity domestically and externally, that we have had the privilege to enjoy since this Parliament was established.</P>
      <P>I have attended many debates here in the past 34 or 35 years and have seen a welcome change of mood. That mood has been born of an understanding that did not exist 34 or 35 years ago and a confidence that from now on we want to share with all on this island the future prospects for this island, in whatever fashion and through whatever structures can be agreed between us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> I had the privilege this week of meeting some students from an American university, who had been in the North of Ireland and came South for a briefing from people who might have some comments to make to them. It was clear that they, too, shared what I call a positive impatience about this matter. They saw the dynamic that is affecting our community now. Sometimes we judge ourselves too harshly but that is another day's work. They saw the vigorous confidence of our young people and that they are competing with others in the world in their fields and beating the best of them, but they are also making a significant contribution towards resolving some harrowing human problems throughout the world. That is what gives a society balance &ndash; a balance based on the fact that we should not concentrate only on our immediate, but legitimate and understandable interests, but that we should recognise that, sé i scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine go léir &ndash; we all live in each other's shadow. Our role is to release the young people from the North, to discharge that same role, to give them that balance, confidence and opportunity to make contributions to solve even more deeply entrenched problems than they have inherited from those who went before them in the North.</P>
    <P>The indications at this stage are hopeful. The Taoiseach hit the nail on the head when he said:</P>
    <P>This, I think, is a measure of how well our democracy has developed since independence. We, as members of different parties, have individual policies and aspirations, but we can come together to support initiatives which are critical to the common good of our people, North and South.</P>
    <P>That statement could not have been made here 30 years ago. We might have liked to make it but we could not have made it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that we could not have made it even 15 years ago. As a measure of the commitment and purpose shown by the Leaders of all the parties during their times in Government, we can believe that no person is waiting to set a trap for another person or waiting to demonstrate that he or she is more republican than another person. Everyone is waiting for the opportunity to release the great energy that must be bubbling over in the North and to give the it a new role and status, such as we have been privileged to enjoy here. They should enjoy that role and status whenever the North is mentioned or people think of the North. That is why it is important to demonstrate today our readiness to extend the time for implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the concern that perhaps the time extension is too long and perhaps it may give the wrong signal. Those reservations were expressed legitimately and are well based. What is being done here is a formal clear indication, in the first instance, by the Government and by this directly <Col N="747" /> elected Oireachtas that, however impatient and dissatisfied we may be, we are still prepared to give every opportunity to those engaged in the political process in the North to resolve this issue in common cause and to open up the avenues to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I agree with what the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, said about the statement made and attributed to Dermot Nesbitt of the Ulster Unionist Party, and I have no reason to doubt it. I have had informal discussions with him from time to time. My only reservation in saying that is that I practised the discipline over the years, particularly when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs, of not referring to such informal discussions. As someone said &ldquo;some of my best friends are Unionists&rdquo;. I could mention those people now and unfortunately one of the them, Harold McCusker, is dead. I was concerned that, if I mentioned that I had had a reasoned discussion and understanding with them or said I had met them or they had met me, the fact that they had met one of the awful Fianna Fáil tribe, as it is seen, would undermine them. I hope we have reached the point that I can say I believe what Dermot Nesbitt said about a formula that would give them the scope to bring about the agreement and understanding on the decommissioning issue. He made a very statesmanlike and courageous statement. I hope it is reflected and supported by those within that party, who have consistently taken difficult steps, and difficult steps must be taken. I remember over the years those who wanted to take that step, whether it was Terence O'Neill, Chichester-Clark, Faulkner, Porter, McIvor, Ferguson or Long. That is a litany of forgotten men who were isolated because they were prepared to step forward. I hope that day is also gone.</P>
    <P>They can be sure of one thing now. Whatever threat, lack of understanding or selfish preoccupation they felt existed here is gone. There is no threat now &ndash; let them be assured of that. There is no selfish preoccupation or attempt to take over and, as some said, &ldquo;bring them into a united Ireland&rdquo;. I always hated hearing that term. There is no such intention. Every step of the way towards this historic Agreement was based on agreement between Governments, between North and South and in the North itself. It hardly needs to be said that agreement by definition must be subject to full consent. There is no attempt to deceive, much less to undermine. This Bill demonstrates that we are waiting for the agreement to be put into place.</P>
    <P>I visited the House of Commons for the first time in the mid 1960s, when Seán Lemass, that most far-seeing of men, sent some of us youngsters to make contacts and establish relations. The Speaker's convention was rigidly in force. We have a written and detailed Constitution. However, the conventions in England, which does not have a written constitution, were as <Col N="748" /> binding as our detailed written provisions. The famous Speaker's convention meant one could not raise any issue relating to Northern Ireland in the House of Commons. We have come a long way since.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to those of that period who were as impatient, if not more, as us. Some of them, such as Kevin McNamara, Stanley Orme, who recently retired, Jock Stallard and many others always felt this was an abrogation of their democratic responsibility. Together, we gradually changed that. In those days the only contacts between Taoisigh and Prime Ministers were irregular and bilateral and they were not formalised. Current contact is not just based on formal structures, it is much stronger than that. It is based on a real, deep and personal commitment on the part of our Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister who have a close personal working relationship based on that confidence and trust which is so vital. Nevertheless, I think they would both acknowledge that those who went before them, perhaps in more difficult times &ndash; all Taoisigh in this House during that period and nearly all the Prime Ministers on the other side &ndash; helped in their way to build a framework which now forms a solid foundation. Neither Government is trying to make it more difficult for the other, to gain advantage or to proclaim or promote at the expense of the other. They are both trying to reassure and lay a firm basis for the future to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Another great feature of the process, which does not have the same profile &ndash; we are happy about that and would never claim it does &ndash; is the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, the representative body of elected representatives of Britain and Ireland. This has also changed dramatically. I was not a founder member as I was in Government then. However, I know from those who were Members then and still are, that a dramatic change, about which we joked at our last discussion at Dromoland, has taken place in that body since the days when members viewed each other with suspicion, apprehension, and serious misgivings. There are now likely to be differences among the Irish representatives, among British representatives and even among representatives from the same party. This highlights the common purpose among representatives of both Parliaments.</P>
    <P>Whatever arrangements are to be put in place that will affect the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, as the Taoiseach said this morning in terms of the Government, all we want to make clear is that we are ready to play a role. There is an understanding, a common purpose and commitment as well as the practical arrangements that affect a range of areas not confined to the North but to Europe and elsewhere. We stand ready to play that part and to be fully effective when this agreement is put in place. At our last meeting we were asked to convey to the Government, which I already conveyed to the Taoiseach, that we are ready to play whatever role the <Col N="749" /> Government thinks the body can play in the new phase when the Good Friday Agreement comes into full effect. I hope that will be interpreted as a signal borne of understanding, concern and confidence.</P>
    <P>I know John Hume since we were students together. We were good friends and neither of us was aware that he would subsequently play such a magnificent role. We just happened to become friends for one reason or another. However, the sacrifice the SDLP has made over the years and its consistent commitment to democracy, despite the most appalling barriers, intimidation and threats, which I witnessed on some occasions in their homes, must now be honoured in an effective and practical way by putting those structures into place so the next generation in the North will have the same prospects as us.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that about a month ago the IDA and the IDB in the North simultaneously issued their reports on developments in 1998. It was significant that the growth in investment in this jurisdiction was dramatic. At the same time, in the North, where people are as intelligent as us &ndash; if we were honest we would say more so in that they have a sharper wit and perhaps more ability &ndash; there was a fall-off, although it was not too serious. That is the kind of scene we do not want to see continue.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, just as this debate is a demonstration of our generosity, borne of confidence, when these agreements are in place there will be constant negotiations in the future on the narrow ground in the North, which is where the constant focus is. It is very difficult to get to the full reality when one is confined to a table about who says what, who gets what, when it was said, etc.</P>
    <P>The only way to guarantee and nail down that future is to take the argument to the wider world. For example, we are part of the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the Court of Justice but they are not. Why should that be? I have no doubt that when it comes to putting the final stages in place, whoever is in Government here will be generous, confident and tolerant in regard to their representation in Europe, at the United Nations, the IMF and elsewhere for the first time. We will ensure these avenues and this huge potential will be made available to our fellow Irishmen in the North. I hope that opportunity will arise sooner rather than later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable this legislation is necessary because it underlines that, despite the optimism which was consequent on the signing of the Agreement, the massive endorsement in the referenda and an encouraging election result in Northern Ireland, the putting together of the many pieces of the jigsaw of the Agreement laid down in the table has not happened. If there had been a greater level of progress we would not be debating this legislation to extend the timeframe for the constitutional provisions to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> The sense of excitement and anticipation which followed the signing of the Agreement has faded somewhat over the past 12 months. We are left now with a difficult and demanding situation. There has not been a lack of commitment on the part of the Irish or British Governments. Their willingness to examine all possible avenues is to be commended. However, it is not easy at this stage to see a way through the impasse which, in my view, is the decommissioning issue.</P>
    <P>The basic principles of democracy must not be undermined in the efforts to find a way forward. If a democracy is to be preserved, those who wish to participate in Government must abide by the principles of democracy. Before Sinn Féin is given seats in the Northern Ireland Executive, the republican movement must make a clear and unambiguous statement that its campaign of violence is over for good. That has not happened over the past 12 months. Various statements of intent, circling around the issue, have been made but there has been no unequivocal statement that the campaign of violence is over for good. Such a declaration, even now, coupled with a public commitment to exclusively democratic means, would make it easier for all to find a resolution to the decommissioning issue.</P>
    <P>It cannot be ignored or denied that decommissioning is an integral element of the Good Friday Agreement. There has been significant progress in all other aspects of the Agreement but progress in this area has been almost non-existent; at best, it has been minimal. Statements by the IRA to the effect that there never will be decommissioning do not inspire confidence. It is a year since Mr. Padraig Wilson, speaking on behalf of the republican prisoners in the Maze, stated that voluntary decommissioning will be a natural development of the Peace Process. Where stands that statement a year later? It has been followed by three statements on behalf of the IRA which have said there will be no progress on decommissioning now or ever.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for breaking the political logjam that now exists in Northern Ireland rests primarily with Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party. Both Governments and all the other political parties have made tremendous efforts to find a way forward. It seems there are people in the republican movement taking the view that decommissioning is an optional extra, that it is not in the Agreement, it is not fundamental to a peace process and it can be considered at some future stage. That is wrong. As various solutions are put forward by the Government, they are rejected either by Sinn Féin or the Ulster Unionist Party. Perhaps, the time has come for the two Governments to invite these two parties to meet separately in intensive discussions and to come forward with a joint proposal.</P>
    <P>As every Member of this elected assembly knows, the people in Northern Ireland want peace through this Agreement, which is over a year old. That was underlined in the recent <i>Daily Telegraph</i> poll, which showed quite clearly that a <Col N="751" /> massive 93 per cent of the Protestant population wants a start to be made on the decommissioning issue now, and 68 per cent of Catholics believe the Provisional IRA movement and the loyalist paramilitaries should start to decommission now. Only 12 per cent of Sinn Féin supporters in that survey were of the view that decommissioning would never take place. I cannot understand how a situation can be allowed continue where those in charge of arms and ammunition dumps can ignore yet again the overwhelming view of the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The rejection of the Hillsborough document is regrettable. I would have thought that document would have been seen as a form of progress report or mid-term statement rather than a rewriting of the Agreement, as it was regarded in certain circles.</P>
    <P>It may be too much to expect any resolution of present difficulties while we are in the course of yet another round of elections. Elections, by their very nature, make politicians somewhat nervous &ndash; one need only look at the degree of trembling on the Government benches in this House in recent months. That is because political parties are reluctant to take risks with their core electorate in the period immediately prior to an election. I hope it is only the election factor that is delaying political progress now. Once the European elections are over, in a few weeks' time a further round of intensive dialogue will be required if the new deadline of 30 June is to be met. Unfortunately, the election results may be used as an excuse for further delay. Any further delay in establishing the political structures in Northern Ireland carries, as we know, enormous risks.</P>
    <P>Last year, the momentum of goodwill behind the Good Friday Agreement carried the people through the horrors of Omagh in August and the sectarian hatred surrounding Drumcree which lasted throughout the summer. That goodwill has been frittered away. There is no momentum in the ongoing round of fruitless talks.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the shadow of Drumcree looms once more on the horizon. An open wound in Northern Ireland society, it continues to leak its poison into the community. It is welcome that the Church of Ireland has started to take seriously its responsibility at Drumcree. As well as examining the religious and moral questions surrounding Drumcree, the Church of Ireland might consider the legal avenues available to prevent church lands at Drumcree from being used as a gathering place for law breakers. An injunction against the Orange Order might be considered, or the use of the laws of trespass might be an avenue worth pursuing to address the matter.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the time has come for the Ulster Unionist Party to break its formal links with a sectarian organisation which is working to undermine it. The time is also right to make it a rule that members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary <Col N="752" /> or any future police force cannot be members of sectarian organisations. This rule applied to the RIC and had much to commend it. The Patten report will be published in the summer or early autumn. It is hoped that document will chart the way for a police force which will enjoy the confidence of all sides.</P>
    <P>Unless the 30 June deadline is met, the future may be bleak. Paramilitary and sectarian groups are once again stepping up their vicious campaigns of intimidation and violence. The marching season will cause further tension. Peace and a commitment to democratic politics are not sufficiently established in Northern Ireland to make one confident for the future. Significant elements of the political culture still find the politics of violence an attractive option. Those who believe in the politics of democracy and a peaceful resolution to conflict must ensure that the men of violence are not given an excuse or opportunity to return to their evil ways.</P>
    <P>In spite of the present impasse on decommissioning and the establishment of the executive there has been great progress. The reintegration programme for prisoners, both pre and post-release, is under way and working well. Victims' issues are being addressed, and those issues will always be difficult. Housing, job training and re-employment and education of released prisoners are being addressed.</P>
    <P>In other areas it is worth reminding ourselves of the progress made: the human rights commission; the equality commission; the scaling down and removal of military installations; the reform of the RUC giving rise to the Patten report; the economic, social and cultural issues; the economic investment in areas of high unemployment where discrimination was, all too sadly, a feature of society.</P>
    <P>The one area where little or no progress can be reported is decommissioning. How could we envisage a situation in a democratically elected government where members of the executive of the Assembly could, by dint of pressing a button, call upon 588 AK-47 assault rifles, 300 other assault rifles including armalites, 12 general purpose machine guns, 38 other machine guns, 6 SAM-7 surface to air missiles, 100 pistols, 60 revolvers, 265 grenades, 2.5 tonnes of semtex, 1,200 detonators and more than 30 shotguns? How could people in a democratic state have confidence in a government where there are parties within the government and within the assembly which have close associations with those who have such arsenals? </P>
    <P>Those involved in the negotiations must keep the faith. I commend the Taoiseach and his Ministers for their work. They must not be disheartened by the snail's pace at which events are moving. We should take courage from what has already been achieved and realise that the scale of the problem is not beyond a solution. Northern Ireland does not compare in any way to the horrors we are seeing in the summer of 1999 in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> If we wish to be optimistic we can reflect on many of the statements made by powerful politicians over the years. I can think of no better statement than that made by President Clinton in November 1995 when he visited Mackies engineering works in Belfast. Urging all parties in the conflict to start peace talks, he said that honest dialogue is not surrender but is an act of strength and commonsense. He stated that the time had come to sustain the momentum and lock in the gains of peace. He said that people who define their lives by what they are against will not ever escape the dead end street of violence. He urged the vast majority to ensure the ship of peace does not sink on the rocks of old habits and hard grudges.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, in the summer of 1999, the rocks of old habits and hard grudges are still very much in evidence. The work of building a normal political and civil society may be slow and tedious and at times it may appear that the results do not justify the effort. Continued intensive engagement, however, by both Governments is necessary. Violence has deeply damaged Northern Ireland and it still requires political intensive care. By continuing to act together, both Governments have shown a capacity to manage a complex political situation to the benefit of both communities in Northern Ireland. This mutual co-operation has also contributed to a richer and more effective relationship between Ireland and Britain, as Deputy O'Kennedy said. The close co-operation between the two Governments is a model of politics which could be usefully applied to other areas of conflict around the world.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and commend the Taoiseach and his Minister. I wish them well in the days that lie ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by this debate to record some of the measures which have been taken by my Department in the course of the peace negotiations in the North of Ireland. I also wish to have recorded the measures which it is intended to take in due course.</P>
      <P>Respect for human rights is an essential feature of the Good Friday Agreement. In this jurisdiction we have enjoyed the protection of what amounts to a bill of rights contained in the 1937 Constitution which has been enforced by the courts. While some may argue that the Constitution is now out of date, it is worth recalling that the Constitution Review Group chaired by Dr. T. K. Whitaker found, as recently as 1996, that in many respects the human rights enshrined in the Constitution exceed those set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Good Friday Agreement there are commitments to improve the protection of human rights. In so far as my Department is concerned, the following measures have been taken. The Taoiseach has already outlined in his contribution to the debate the position regarding the establish<Col N="754" /> ment of a human rights commission. The Human Rights Commission Bill, which establishes a human rights commission in this jurisdiction with a mandate and remit at least equivalent to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is currently in the process of being drafted in the Attorney General's office. Extensive consultations have taken place on this including the office of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, non-governmental organisations and committees of the Oireachtas. As the Taoiseach indicated already, I hope it will be possible to publish the Bill in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>As part of the Good Friday Agreement the Government committed itself to further examination of the question of incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Irish law. This question, which was also examined by the Constitution Review Group to which I already referred, is being examined in accordance with that commitment. The issues involved, for the reasons set out in the Report of the Constitution Review Group, are complex and raise difficult legal and constitutional issues which require further in-depth consideration.</P>
    <P>Soon after the Agreement the Government established a Victims Commission under the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson. His report is due to be presented soon.</P>
    <P>Employment equality has already been provided for in the Employment Equality Act which was enacted in June 1998. The Act outlaws discrimination on nine distinct grounds. The grounds are gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. On 8 March last I announced a new infrastructure for equality which will comprise the Equality Authority and the office of Director of Equality Investigations. I also appointed the members of the Equality Authority Designate. The Act is set to come into operation on 1 September 1999.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill, which is awaiting Committee Stage in this House, will prohibit discrimination outside the workplace on similar grounds to those which apply in the area of employment, as I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>A Bill to amend the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 1994, in the context of the Good Friday Agreement is being drafted in the Attorney General's office. It is hoped the Bill will be published during this session.</P>
    <P>In addition, in relation to prisoners, there is the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998. The Act provides for the establishment of a commission to advise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with regard to the exercise of his powers in relation to prisoners who are considered to be qualifying prisoners for the purpose of the Good Friday Agreement. Since then a total of 24 prisoners has been released following consideration by the commission.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement also obliges the Government to initiate a wide-ranging review of <Col N="755" /> the Offences Against the State Acts with a view to both reform and dispensing with those elements no longer required as circumstances permit. Following approval by the Government, I established a committee under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, to carry out the review and to report to me with recommendations for reform. The committee, which also includes a number of independent experts as well as representatives of Departments, offices and agencies, has already begun its work. The review will also cover the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>An important body under the Good Friday Agreement is the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. The commission was in close contact with the participants in the Northern Ireland multi-party negotiations, which included the two Governments, while the negotiations were taking place. It put to the participants, proposals for schemes which would enable decommissioning to take place. These were accepted by the participants. The Good Friday Agreement provided that these schemes would be brought into force by the two Governments by the end of June 1998. This commitment was honoured. In addition, the Commission has been working on the detailed arrangements which will be necessary to enable the schemes to operate. Since the Agreement, it has maintained constant contact with the parties and the Governments with a view to making progress on the issue of decommissioning. To date, one decommissioning event has taken place. In December 1998, a small quantity of LVF arms was decommissioned.</P>
    <P>I, along with the Northern Ireland security Minister, Mr. Adam lngram, meet the commission regularly for the purpose of receiving reports from the commission on its work and to discuss relevant issues. We will continue to do so as necessary. Officials of my Department are also in regular contact with the commission.</P>
    <P>While these measures reflect positive developments, there are two other legislative measures, which are also the responsibility of my Department. These are the amendment to the Offences Against the State Act, 1998, passed following the atrocity in Omagh last summer, and the legislation passed last week to assist in the recovery of the remains of victims of paramilitary violence. Reflection on the need for this type of legislation, bearing in mind the pain and suffering endured by victims of violence, should surely act as an incentive in the search for a resolution of the remaining problem.</P>
    <P>Security was mentioned by a number of speakers. Obviously the continued attacks on Nationalists, the murder of Ms Rosemary Nelson and attempts to burn the homes of Nationalists are matters of the gravest concern. Those concerns have been raised by the Minister for Foreign <Col N="756" /> Affairs, Deputy Andrews, with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam.</P>
    <P>On security co-operation, the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the RUC are in regular contact and I am assured that co-operation remains at a high level. In addition, the Garda Commissioner provides regular briefings on overall security.</P>
    <P>The timeframe decided on by the Government represents a prudent course for the reasons outlined by the Taoiseach and to suggest a shorter period would be wrong. In general terms today's debate has been a most constructive one. The Leaders of both Opposition parties have put forward in general terms sound and constructive proposals. That is the way in which politics should operate in our democracy. Today's debate on the peace process is of immense importance to all of the people of this island. It is perhaps a timely reminder to everybody involved in the body politic that there are matters of pressing concern which are of deep interest to all of the people of this island. No amount of politicking with local elections in mind should deflect us from the objective of securing a peaceful future for all on this island.</P>

We should discuss policy in this House; we should discuss what is best for the people and we should do so in a constructive manner in the same way as this debate has been conducted. I firmly believe that politics by smear, innuendo or misrepresentation does no service to those who engage in it or to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is both welcome and unwelcome. It is probably bitterly disappointing for most people in this House that we must introduce this kind of legislation. When the Good Friday Agreement was signed, there was an expectation that the situation on this island would be transformed within a matter of months, resulting in a new and agreed Ireland, one where Unionists, Nationalists, republicans and loyalists could negotiate their own future secure in the belief that the use of force, the threat of resort to force and moral blackmail was removed from the picture. As we can see from the increasing frequency of loyalist attacks, that is not the case. The guns are not silent and the death squads continue to operate. It strikes me now, as it did when the Agreement was signed, that a significant block of people within the Unionist community still adhere to the unyielding instinct Kipling captured so well in his poem about 1912. Andrew Bonar Law, the then Conservative Leader, spoke about the existence of stronger forces than parliamentary majorities. We are now witnessing that being played out in the landscape of the politics <Col N="757" /> of this island, namely, the easy recourse to violence or the threat of violence.</P>
      <P>We have an unhealthy obsession with decommissioning in this House. Deputy Flanagan's contribution was a worthy one but he seemed to presume that decommissioning was something which could be easily achieved. That is one of the pervading myths and weaknesses of the peace process, that somehow, in some magical way, the IRA and other paramilitary groupings will surrender their weaponry and fall on their swords. The demand for decommissioning is often made without a corresponding and simultaneous demand being made of the panoply of State control by British forces and the Unionist majority in the Six Counties not merely to reform the RUC but to eradicate it in its current form. We daily witness, from the revelations in regard to the Rosemary Nelson case, the unhealthy level of collusion that exists between the RUC and loyalist paramilitary groupings. The evidence is damning.</P>
      <P>If one were to believe the revelations in Mr. Mc Philemy's book, <i>The Committee</i>, one might assume that such levels of collusion are not merely confined to the RUC, but extend far wider throughout the political process in the Six Counties, possibly even to the highest level of the Official Unionist Party. The book, which is banned in the UK, suggests that Mr. Trimble may even have sat on particular illegal committees. I do not know whether that or any of the other assertions made in the book are true but I am rather alarmed by them. It would be very difficult for someone to write a book today which made similar allegations about a Member of this House. It would be difficult to suggest that any Member of this House had participated in some illegal, shadowy committee which orchestrated the deaths of members of the Nationalist and Catholic community in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>That such allegations have been made and are being taken very seriously in some quarters is very alarming and represents the extent to which this process has been sundered because of an unyielding instinct within the Unionist community. Unfortunately, it appears that Mr. Trimble and other members of his party are hostage to such unyielding elements, people who not only voted against the Good Friday Agreement but want to destroy it. That is very dangerous.</P>
      <P>We must maintain the careful bipartisanship cultivated by many political leaders from all sides of this House, among them Deputies Bruton, Quinn and Spring and former Deputies FitzGerald and Haughey. The people of Ireland will not thank this generation of political leaders if it becomes divided and presents a weak negotiating team to face down this unyielding resistance on the Unionist side.</P>

      <P>Bipartisanship has been one of the great strengths of this process, together with the mathematical fact of the large parliamentary <Col N="758" /> majority in Britain. Recent allegations in regard to financial scandals are weakening our political process and making it very vulnerable. It appears to people outside this House that the political class is tearing itself apart in the Republic, tearing itself apart, as the Minister stated, by a daily diet of conjecture and pseudo-revelation about people's past involvement in the running of this country. That is a dangerous point from which to proceed. Perhaps it will require a general election to cure that attitude and ensure we can move ahead in a positive way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on all sides are really only interested in building prosperity for the people of Ireland. Unfortunately, there seems to be a tendency to rule the country by tribunal. This country cannot be run by a tribunal based in Dublin Castle, it can only be run by the elected, mandated Government of the country of which Deputy Bertie Ahern is the leader. The peace process is not being assisted by the kind of political opportunism we are witnessing in regard to the tribunals. The tribunals should be allowed do their work and the Government should get on with its work.</P>
      <P>Our political system is weak and vulnerable at the moment. That weakness will be ruthlessly exploited by the traditional enemies of peace on this island. Such exploitation will do no service to the cause of democracy in this House or in the wider context of the island.</P>
      <P>The fact that this legislation is going through the House is bitterly disappointing. The promise of the Good Friday Agreement has yet to be fulfilled. I hope it is fulfilled and that the envisaged changes to Articles 2 and 3 are enacted. However, there is nothing much to encourage me on that front at the moment, precisely because of the obsession with decommissioning in the absence of a corresponding obsession in regard to the raft of allegations levelled against the RUC about its collusion with paramilitary groupings. These are very serious matters.</P>
      <P>Let us recall the memory of 1969 when the Provisional IRA came into existence essentially because of a perception among an element of the Nationalist community in the North that it was defenceless and needed guns. Those guns were supplied &ndash; some people suggest that Members of this House may have supplied guns for that cause. That is recent folk memory and not one which can be easily eradicated. When I hear people speak about decommissioning as something which can be easily achieved, I reach for my volume of Thomas Davis. In his poem &ldquo;The Dungannon Convention&rdquo; he wrote:</P>
      <P>So they give as a boon what they dare not withhold</P>
      <P>And Ireland a nation leaps up as of old</P>
      <P>With a name and a trade and a flag of her own</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> And an army to defend both people and throne</P>
    <P>But woe worth the day if to falsehood or fears</P>
    <P>She surrenders the guns of her brave volunteers.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of attitude Deputy Proinsias De Rossa sometimes depicts as &lsquo;the pike in the thatch' mentality. That mentality still exists. The almost obsessional desire that it should will itself away is rather unrealistic.</P>
    <P>We need to implement the Good Friday Agreement as quickly as possible and the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, is the right person to do that. He will implement the Agreement with speed and in co-operation with those members of the Unionist community and the Unionist political parties who are interested in compromise. It must be emphasised, however, that when the Taoiseach put his name on the Good Friday Agreement he pledged the support of this party and a number of other parties in the House. He went to those negotiations confident in the knowledge that his own party would support him and that the bipartisan approach that exists in this House would hold up. Unfortunately, the Unionist community does not have the same strength and that is debilitating the process immeasurably. At a time when the Republic is so prosperous as a result of our successful economy, there is a danger that the electorate may become bored or disillusioned with the process and, inevitably, that political leaders might become bored also. If nothing else, we are in touch with our electorate.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the Republic has been involved in the peace process in a unique way that perhaps may not continue in the future. The political establishment in this House has been engaged with the North. There is a strong partitionist mentality in the country and that mentality could yet get a grip of public opinion here and we could become disinterested again. That would be unfortunate.</P>
    <P>This legislation is regrettable but we must enact it so that we can honour our commitments to Articles 2 and 3, but we do so with a proviso. Every aspect of the Agreement must be implemented. There cannot be trimming of the Agreement and those who seek to do that or move away from the Agreement negotiated by the Taoiseach are moving away from democracy. They are cutting away the fabric of what has been the only true referendum in which the Irish people got an opportunity to speak with one voice about their own destiny. That is the referendum that followed the Good Friday Agreement. That was the only occasion in our long and troubled history that the Irish people, as opposed to the various factions, were asked to give their opinion on what represented an agreement between them. To try to diminish that agreement is an act of profound indifference and negativity towards democracy. I hope the members of the Unionist community who are resisting will change their attitude, realise this process does not thre<Col N="760" /> aten them and that the process is inclusive and democratic.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of meeting Yasser Arafat when he visited Dublin recently and I was struck by the fact that he looked so weak. This person was involved in a process which was delayed for years because of a change of Government and the assassination of a prime minister. He is a very tired man, as are many of the people engaged in the Middle East peace process. That is a tragedy but it would be an even greater tragedy if there was a similar long delay in implementing this Agreement. Such a delay would take its toll on the leading participants who have made such an enormous contribution to this process. If that happens it will be a tragedy. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

Deputy Bruton queried my statement yesterday that the draft Hillsborough Declaration was outside the broad Good Friday Agreement. I was simply expressing a view put forward by all the pro-Agreement parties. Both I and Prime Minister Blair were berated by everybody, with the exception of the UUP, on the basis that this was outside the Agreement.

      <P>We made a joint statement at Hillsborough.

The pro-Agreement parties, with the exception of the UUP, were adamant that we should have followed the proper <Col N="761" /> sequence. Deputy Quinn explained the matter this morning when he said preconditions were put into it, as did a number of my colleagues here. Whether we like it or not, I have to continue to negotiate but the reason we have had so many deadlines over the period was because people put in preconditions. That does not take away from the fact that we also have to solve the problem of decommissioning but that is the reason for so many delays.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton also referred to the widespread attacks on Catholics across large areas of Northern Ireland. I referred to that in my opening contribution today and also yesterday.

      <P>The information I have, which is not the best, is that they are small groups, some new, others breakaway. I understand they are all small groups, although I have heard that since last autumn. They may be small but they had the capability to assassinate Rosemary Nelson with sophisticated armaments. I worry about small groups in cases like that. The same happened in Newry last year with what was meant to be a small group. On the other hand, it appears that already there are new splinter groups emerging. This is a murky area.</P>
      <P>The Government has made strong representation calling for effective protection for Catholic families and communities but that did not get much publicity. I get information on a weekly basis about families who are being intimidated and forced out of their homes. About 20 families have been forced out of their homes on Garvaghy Road. Two weeks ago, an 84 year old man who had lived all his life on the outskirts of Garvaghy Road was intimidated and forced out of his home. That man remained living there during the 30 years of the troubles. I inquired whether he was intimidated or if he left of his own accord but the security reports from the RUC indicate he was forced out following intimidation. Unfortunately, this is continuing to happen and at this stage &ndash; although I get no satisfaction from saying this &ndash; it is exclusively the Nationalist community which is being intimidated. As I said yesterday, my concern is that people will begin to retaliate and the cycle of intimidation will begin again. We want to avoid that and that is the reason I have put so much pressure on the RUC and the security forces to deal with this issue. Recently, in south Antrim, the RUC asked the British Army to go back on the streets to deal with these problems. The newly elected Assembly member in south Antrim, Danny O'Connor, has made strong representations about this issue. I do not know him personally but I understand he is a genuine person.</P>

      <Col N="762" /> Deputy Quinn expressed the hope that the two Governments would sing from the same hymn sheet and continue to convey to same message to all the parties in the negotiations. The Deputy need have no concerns on this point. We meet the parties collectively 90 per cent of the time to ensure we avoid that. We sometimes agree but what happens when we get outside the door of No. 10 can be slightly different. There is not much I can do about that. The presentations of what did or did not happen a fortnight ago would stretch anyone's imagination. However, I understand why these things have to happen. We are all realistic enough to understand the difficult situations which party leaders and others can get into. The best course of action is not to comment.</P>
    <P>All commentators agree the key element of the process is the close working relationship between the two Governments. This relationship has been remarkably close regarding the positions put forward by the Prime Minister and me. The same applies to our colleagues, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Secretary of State and other Ministers. The two Governments have put forward joint positions on all aspects of the Agreement and that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton inquired about the current status of the Mitchell Principles <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Good Friday Agreement. I spoke on this matter not long ago. The Mitchell Principles stand on their own right and continue to have the Government's support. I regularly cite them to the parties in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement stands on its own, but the essence of the Mitchell Principles is reflected in parts of the Agreement, such as the declaration of support at the beginning of the Agreement. The Government supports and stands over everything in the Agreement and in the Mitchell Principles on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the way in which Sinn Féin and the UUP rejected proposals at different times and raised the possibility of the two Governments inviting the two parties to meet intensively to come up with a joint proposal. I thank the Deputy for urging us to continue, but I share his view that there is a tendency for the parties to move too slowly as if we had all the time in the world. It is past time for the parties to respond to what the Deputy rightly said is the wish of the majority of the people, North and South, and to implement the Agreement.</P>
    <P>There have been many meetings involving Sinn Féin and the Unionists. More recently there have been round table talks with Sinn Féin, the UUP and the SDLP to try to reach agreement. Any party which takes upon itself the responsibility of letting go the promise and the prospects of the Good Friday Agreement will have to answer for that decision. All the parties are being asked to go as far as they can and then to go a little further. We have to reach an agreement and we are all determined to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> Deputy Quinn asked me to say a little more about the extension of time. The British Government will devolve powers to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly on 1 July. Influenced by this measure, the Prime Minister set the deadline of 30 June for completion of the Northern Ireland talks with a view to devolution by 1 July, concurrent with Wales and Scotland. That is logical. Deputy Bruton is slightly critical of this move but the Prime Minister's logic was that the three should take place together.</P>

      <P>I have already said what we will do on 1 July. If the parties have not reached agreement the two Prime Ministers will sit down to see what we will do. We should not predetermine what we will or will not do. The House has to be mindful of the fact that there are 55 million people in Britain who have wide interests in many international issues. To put it mildly, they are engaged in a fairly serious war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Time considerations are an issue. Tony Blair has put an enormous amount of time into this matter every day. He does not complain or protest but he cannot put in endless hours and endless weekends. This commitment is acknowledged by all the parties. Not only does Mr. Blair meet the political parties, he also meets <Col N="764" /> many organisations, schools and groups which travel to London.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on Second Stage, extensive efforts are being made to reach an inclusive settlement by that date, if possible. There are difficult issues to overcome and compromises will have to be made. To be sustainable, a final settlement must have the backing of all the communities in Northern Ireland. The two Governments will assist in developing and delivering the various commitments in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the frustration of those who feel the negotiation process has been too long and who wish to see 30 June as a final date for the Northern Ireland Assembly and all other matters. The two Governments share the position that matters must be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible. However, in coming to a decision to extend the period for a further 12 months, the Government had to balance a number of considerations and make the best judgment possible in light of the difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Government's primary concern is to ensure there are no legal impediments to the bringing into force of the Agreement as soon as full agreement emerges. We have to take account of the fact that Drumcree comes four days after the deadline and of the signals coming from the parties which will cast a shadow forward. These signals are coming from the parties on the ground and I cannot ignore that.</P>
      <P>Amendments to the Constitution are given serious consideration by the Government before being put to the people in a referendum. The 19th Amendment of the Constitution enacted on 3 June was particularly significant in respect of the substitution of new Articles 2 and 3 which had been a contentious issue for the Unionist community for many years. The amendment has the backing of all the people of this island and the Government could not, and will not, let it fall without due consideration of the implications of all of this which could involve our inability to fulfil the integral part of the Good Friday Agreement with the adverse consequences which would flow.</P>
      <P>Intensive efforts to reach a settlement will continue up to 30 June and beyond, if necessary. We must be cognisant of the summer recess, the proximity of the 30 June deadline and the prospects that, even if an executive was up and running by that date with full powers, further time would be needed to put in place the remaining parts of the British-Irish Agreement. I hope they can happen concurrently, but we cannot be certain about that, given the experience of the last 12 months. In this context, it is sensible and prudent to seek the extension of a period for one year rather than one month.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 14, to delete &ldquo;of 24 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;up to and including the 30th day of June, 1999&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have already covered the arguments for the proposal in my contribution on Second Stage, so I will quickly revisit some of the details. I noted with concern the Taoiseach's concluding remarks on Second Stage regarding the 30 June deadline. I hope an interpretation is not put on his references to being sensible and his remarks about what might happen after 30 June, that there was not a resolve on the part of the Irish and British Governments to insist on 30 June as the deadline they have declared. There has been tremendous frustration and anger in many quarters at the failure so far to implement the Agreement as agreed between both Governments and all parties on Good Friday last year and since endorsed by the overwhelming mass of the electorate, both North and South.</P>
      <P>There was a requirement to establish the shadow Executive in July last year. The North-South Ministerial Council was to have met and completed its work by the end of October last year. The d'Hondt mechanism was to have been triggered by 10 March this year and then 29 March and 2 April this year, Good Friday, became more missed deadlines. It has clearly been the case in the past that, when people are focused on set deadlines and not on distant and imprecise ones, they apply themselves to the work in hand, endeavour to meet the deadline and reach the type of agreement required to achieve the necessary solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned the signal given by the Bill and the Taoiseach's earlier commentary is that 30 June is not the definitive deadline the two <Col N="766" /> Governments indicated it is. It is important for all parties to the ongoing search for a break in the impasse that 30 June is clearly and emphatically stated for what it already has been declared, namely a deadline and an absolute requirement for the triggering of d'Hondt, the setting up of the Executive and the movement towards the establishment the North-South Ministerial Council and implementation bodies.</P>
    <P>That is critical and that is why I tabled the amendment to delete the words &ldquo;of 24 months&rdquo; and substitute them with the words &ldquo;up to and including the 30th day of June, 1999&rdquo;. To do otherwise is to invite further procrastination, delaying and obstructionism which have amounted to the tactics of the Ulster Unionist Party over many months past. A mistake is being made and one which will certainly be grasped by those who wish to see this process run into the ground. For those who take that view, there is already in the establishment of the Assembly in the North all they would have wished for, and now all that is needed is for the more difficult elements which must be faced to be set aside or binned. That is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The amendment is reasonable, rational and deserves the support of the Government. It should adopt it and I ask that it be supported. In the event it is not to be supported, I will not oppose the Bill as initiated. However, I urge in the spirit of what I have said earlier on Second Stage and what I say now that people recognise the seriousness of the moment and importance of the opportunity and agree the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will not support Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendment for three reasons. He attempts to compare the deadline with others which have been set and missed, but none of those were set in legislative format. They were operational, aspirational, declared and agreed upon but did not have the force of a legislative proposal behind them. That is why it would be a mistake to confuse those deadlines which were sadly not met &ndash; I share the Deputy's frustration and sense of disappointment &ndash; with a legislative one.</P>
      <P>We also oppose the amendment because the logistics of setting the date to 30 June makes it very tight. We know from previous practice that certain deadlines have been met or progress has been made two or three days after the date set. We could find ourselves in a situation where, at the height of sensitive negotiations trying to achieve a compromise, the time towards the deadline would be ticking away and the Dáil would have to be reconvened to extend it by a certain amount of time.</P>
      <P>A final reason given by Taoiseach and of which I was not aware is that the commencement of devolution in Scotland and Wales has a symmetry about it which makes sense from a British perspective. That is something I can see as being of importance in an apparently arbitrary date of 30 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> Deputy Ó Caoláin said the amendment was both reasonable and rational. Sinn Féin's interpretation of the Agreement and its implementation, especially regarding the impasse over decommissioning, is certainly rational but is not reasonable. It is rational for Sinn Féin to argue that decommissioning is not a precondition for the setting up of the Executive. That is clear and we have stated it repeatedly. However, it is reasonable, as Deputy Flanagan stated, for the Unionist community, particularly the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party, and other communities in Northern Ireland and the Republic to see some indication of movement.</P>
    <P>The Agreement did not stipulate a fixed timetable for the release of prisoners or the commencement of a number of the operational commitments it contains. In that context, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform referred to the legislation and his schedule of announcements in respect of the commission and the Irish citizenship and nationality legislation. There was no fixed timetable governing those matters but movement of a reasonable kind has been made.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the contribution of the Deputy representing Sinn Féin in this House. He stated quite clearly that Sinn Féin cannot deliver on this issue but that it retains significant representation and influence within and links to the army council of the IRA. I refer to that organisation as the IRA, not the &ldquo;republican movement&rdquo; because as far as I am concerned that movement includes the Labour Party and every party. There is no royalist or monarchist party in this House. In my opinion, some indication of genuine movement is a reasonable expectation on the part of the 95 per cent of the people who voted in favour of the Agreement just over a year ago.</P>
    <P>I do not recall if the Taoiseach replied to the question I posed on Second Stage about the status of the Dermot Nesbitt interview and whether there has been some movement by the Official Unionist Party or the Ulster Unionist Party on this issue. Does that interview represent a breakthrough which might be considered constructive?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a number of comments in replying to Second Stage which Deputy Ó Caoláin may have missed. We are focused on a much shorter timescale and I would like to reach an agreement before 30 June because to do so would have much merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To repeat what I said on Second Stage, the promised extension is not an indication of the failure of the Agreement &ndash; the possibility of needing it was part of the Agreement &ndash; nor is it to be taken as a signal that the Government believes 12 months will be needed to overcome current difficulties. On the contrary, our efforts are focused on a much shorter timeframe. The extension is rather a way to facilitate further dialogue with all parties to reach an all-inclusive <Col N="768" /> settlement in Northern Ireland and put an end, once and for all, to the violence and political instability with which we have lived for so long. As Deputies will know, the deadline of 30 June has been set for devolution of power to the Northern Ireland Assembly and we are working to achieve this.</P>
    <P>All parties are being asked to go as far as they can and then a little further to reach agreement. For the Agreement to work, it is critically important that they have the backing of their constituents in Northern Ireland. I am heartened by the genuine efforts being made to achieve this, but further strenuous efforts need to be made. In presenting this legislation to provide for an additional timeframe of 12 months, the Government is ensuring there will not be legal impediments to bringing the Agreement into force as soon as the current intensive efforts are successful.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand the Bill will not delay for 12 months the entry into force of the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 and the addition of the new paragraph 8 to Article 29. The Bill proposes an extension of time within which the Government can make the declaration envisaged in Article 29.7.3. Once the basis was established for making the declaration through the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement, the Government would be obliged under the Agreement to make the declaration without delay and the relevant amendments to the Constitution would then enter into force forthwith. Therefore, we are not looking at a full year for the making of the declaration.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn stated, it is important that we continue to try to reach agreement as soon as possible. However, I do not want to enter a situation where the Dáil would go into recess before agreement is reached because nothing would happen for three months and difficulties would arise later. It is our firm belief that we should reach agreement on or before 30 June.</P>
    <P>In terms of the deadlines, Deputy Ó Caoláin was correct about the matters to which he referred and particularly about the fact that difficulties have been caused by delays on the part of the UUP. In the interests of fairness and consistency to people, particularly those in Northern Ireland, who have studied these debates, on the Wednesday of Holy Week this year we hoped that if Sinn Féin had been in a position to sign up we could have reached agreement by the Holy Thursday deadline. We attempted to do so and I did not mind missing another night's sleep. We remained at the negotiations overnight waiting for Sinn Féin to make a decision but, unfortunately, for reasons I understand, it was not in a position to do so. Consequently, that deadline was missed. We must recognise that everyone has difficulties and problems.</P>
    <P>The 30 June deadline is different in that it is a firm deadline set down by the British Prime Minister. Deputy Quinn made a good point when he stated that the original 10 April agreement was <Col N="769" /> really concluded on 8 April but that negotiations had continued until 10 April. We will do everything in our power to meet the deadline and I assure Deputy Ó Caoláin that neither I nor Prime Minister Blair have a desire to go one hour over it. If we can reach an agreement beforehand, we will do so. There is no reason for people to believe otherwise. Prime Minister Blair has already stated, in respect of the Assembly and other matters, that everything could fall if the 30 June deadline is not met. However, rather than deciding what will happen on that date we should try to be positive and find a settlement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked for an assessment of the Dermot Nesbitt interview. Yesterday, the UUP issued a statement which set down its position and then Dermot Nesbitt made a number of additional comments. Sinn Féin also issued a statement last night. We are rapidly running out of time in terms of making as much progress in the next few days as we had hoped. However, I believe that Dermot Nesbitt is trying to signal some direction where we can continue to work constructively, which is what we must do.</P>
    <P>The statement issued by the UUP was more hardline than Mr. Nesbitt's so I do not know exactly what signals he is trying to give. However, we remain in contact with the parties. I spoke to Reg Empey and to Gerry Adams in the past 48 hours. I also had discussions with British and NIO officials to see what might be achieved in the coming days. We will continue to have such discussions, otherwise we will not make progress before the forthcoming elections.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that during the past two weeks, particularly since the meeting ten days ago, Gerry Adams and David Trimble have made extraordinary efforts to try to find a resolution. As stated yesterday, it is doubtful whether one can be found in the coming days. I would assess Dermot Nesbitt's comments as trying to provide us with constructive assistance in that regard.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation of the continuing efforts of my party colleagues within the leadership of Sinn Féin. In relation to the situation <i>vis-à-vis </i>Holy Thursday, the party I represent has no mandate to rewrite the decisions reached on Good Friday 1998 and I would argue that the other parties and the Governments have no right to do so either. That is my clear reading and understanding of the Hillsborough Declaration to which the Taoiseach has just referred.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Quinn's recognition of the rationale behind what I have already outlined. However, if he has failed to accept the reasonableness of the Sinn Féin position, I urge him to at least recognise the reality of the situation faced by my party.</P>

      <P>The Palestinian National Authority decided last year, in co-ordination with the various Christian churches and international donor agencies and countries, to organise a major celebration known as Bethlehem 2000 relating to the start of the new millennium. The celebration itself is to be based in the town of Bethlehem and will last for 16 months, from December 1999 until Easter 2001. The festivities planned will take the form of major international religious and cultural events. These are expected to attract large numbers of pilgrims and tourists. These festivities will clearly have a major impact on the cultural and economic life of the entire region.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the organisation of the celebration is in the hands of a special Minister appointed by President Arafat of the Palestinian National Authority. It was decided that the establishment of an international committee composed of various world leaders from the religious and political spheres would give the celebration additional stature. I understand that among those who have accepted President Arafat's invitation to join the committee are President Chirac of France, President Mandela of South Africa, Prime Minister Blair and a number of other prime ministers. When I was in Gaza last January, President Arafat invited me to join this committee. During his visit here on 3 May I indicated that I was pleased to accept his invitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Membership of the international committee is primarily honorary in nature and in practical terms ensures high level international support for the efforts of the Palestinian authorities to mark the occasion. I regard my membership as fully in keeping with the duties and status of my office as Taoiseach. The committee does not have a specific mandate or work programme, nor do I antici<Col N="771" /> pate undertaking any official engagements as a member of the committee.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that this celebration will commemorate not just the start of a new millennium but the anniversary of the birth of Christ in Bethlehem? Will he agree that the conditions in which many people of Palestinian origin have to live in parts of the area administered by the Palestinian authority are as bad if not worse than physical conditions at the time of the birth of Christ? In Gaza, which the Taoiseach visited, there is a severe problem regarding access to water and other basic essentials. In addition to his commendable work on the Bethlehem 2000 committee, will the Taoiseach make representations to the Israeli authorities asking them to ensure the basics of life are made available to people in territories surrounded by Israeli territory?</P>

      <P>I confirm that the purpose of Bethlehem 2000 is to commemorate and celebrate the birth of Christ. The Pope, Archbishop Carey of Canterbury and many other religious leaders are members of the committee. The conditions in the Gaza strip and in the camps, which have existed since 1947, are extraordinarily severe. I do not believe I have ever seen on television or in films the poverty I walked through last January. These people suffer extraordinary hardship. During my visit I raised the issue with Prime Minister Netanyahu and will take it up with his successor in due course. The UN High Commission has resources, but unfortunately not enough resources are given to these accounts by various countries. In recent years Ireland has given increased resources. Last year $2 million was pledged by Ireland, to be provided over a number of years. That is an annual voluntary contribution given to the UN relief and works agency by way of bilateral support. A sum of $1 million is provided for the Palestinian national authority and NGO projects in the West Bank and Gaza.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that the amount of money Ireland is giving to the Palestinian people, who are effectively refugees in their own country, is considerably less than the assistance we receive from other countries in Europe and from the United States under the Anglo-Irish arrangements? We have a great responsibility, particularly in the celebration of the anniversary of the birth of Christ, who was born in circumstances where his parents were living away from their home and in some difficulty, to do our duty, in accordance with our various religious beliefs, to ensure that people are not living in the sort of conditions the Taoiseach so eloquently described.</P>

      <P>Money is never enough when people are living in squalor. A bilateral aid programme has operated since 1986. Since 1994 we <Col N="772" /> have given further funds and additional resources have been given under the programme signed up for 1999-2003. That will go to NGOs and other groups. Bethlehem University is submitting a proposal for an extension of its library to house this collection of Palestinian literature and cultural material. Irish Aid hopes to be in a position to fund this project. Most of the money we give is direct aid towards the UN relief and works agency, which is badly needed. During my visit I met NGOs and members of the UN relief and works agency and they made the point that Ireland should give as much as it can. Large countries give absolutely nothing towards these projects.</P>

Is he aware of a practice, of which I am ashamed, which has operated under successive administrations, during my term of office and his &ndash; I have documentation to confirm this &ndash; where Palestinian doctors, who get a visa and come here to do a four year post-graduate course and work at the same time, are not told at the time of coming here that if they subsequently seek to have their wife join them she will be denied a visa without reason or explanation? When I pursued this matter, I was told informally that the reason they are denied a visa is the fear that if these devout and religiously observant people were together, they might have a child. If they had a child during the four years, they could not be deported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated on 12 May, in reply to questions, that when I met the Justice for the Forgotten group on 22 April last, I gave a commitment to form an interdepartmental group to work with them in an exercise broadly similar to that carried out in the Government's assessment of the evidence relating to Bloody Sunday. The interdepartmental group, to be chaired by the Assistant Secretary heading the Northern Ireland division of my Department, will assess available evidence, including relevant files and evidence assembled by a sub-committee of the relatives, to establish whether a case could be constructed for having a tribunal of inquiry. It will then report to me.</P>
      <P>I said in my reply on 12 May that the recommendations of the Victims Commissioner, former Tánaiste Mr. John Wilson, would also have to be taken into account since the Government had put the Dublin and Monaghan bombings into his remit. As Mr. Wilson's report is expected very soon, it appears appropriate to hold over consideration of whether there is a need for more precise terms of reference for the interdepartmental group. However, it is clear that, in addition to establishing to what extent there is evidence that will stand up to scrutiny, such as to provide a minimum evidential basis for having a tribunal, the interdepartmental group will also have to consider the cross-jurisdictional aspect of the matter and how it bears on the feasibility and form of any effective inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is my recollection of reports correct, that when in Opposition the Taoiseach gave an undertaking to look at the issue and that later when he had the file in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform examined, there was nothing in it? The Garda Síochána had a substantial file which was not necessarily part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's file. Is the Taoiseach now in a position to clarify the position? Can he confirm that there is sufficient <i>prima facie</i> documentation to warrant an inquiry? Notwithstanding the cross-Border difficulties it might generate to which the Taoiseach <Col N="776" /> referred, is it his intention to proceed and establish such an inquiry?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced these matters on 12 May, which is only a fortnight ago. Getting the committee up and running is the only thing which has happened since then.</P>
      <P>I have raised the Dublin and Monaghan bombings since I was elected to this House in 1977. I did not only raise it when I was in Opposition. I accompanied delegations during meetings with successive Ministers for Justice over the years. I know the families of nine or ten of the victims because they live in my constituency or are from my neighbourhood. I was continually told over the years by Ministers from different parties that there was very little in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform file. That was the correct information.</P>
      <P>However, I discovered 18 months ago that the makers of a television programme met members of the Garda Síochána and had received access to enormous files and records. As somebody who has followed the issue closely over the past 22 years, that was news to me and to the families. As a result, my intention is that the group should have access to the Garda files because they are the only things which would be meaningful to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that, does an alarm bell not ring? Notwithstanding various political representations to the Department of Justice by different Administrations, a blank response was given on the basis that there was little or nothing in the Departmental file when the Department had access, through an operational agency &ndash; namely, the Garda Síochána &ndash; to a substantial amount of information which appeared on a television programme. Has the Taoiseach, since taking office, raised the fundamental question as to why the Department concealed from successive Ministers that documentary evidence was available, not necessarily in complete form but in much more substantial form than was made available to elected Members of this assembly?</P>

      <P>The most recent figures published by the CSO from the quarterly national household survey related to employment and unemployment in the last two quarters of 1998. The results were published on 13 May. The survey also included a module on crime and victimisation in addition to the regular questions on the population and labour force, in the fourth quarter of 1998. Now that the main labour force figures for that quarter have been published, the CSO is giving priority to analysing the answers given to the questions on crime and victimisation. It is expected, subject to unforeseen delays, that the results of this module will become available in July or August.</P>

      <P>The module included questions about household security, people's perceptions of crime and safety, whether the person had been the victim of one of a number of crimes, from a list which included burglary, theft of vehicles, theft from vehicles, vandalism, theft with violence, theft without violence, and assault. These questions were put to persons aged 18 or over in households surveyed in the period from September to November 1998. The questions were aimed at establishing the incidence of crime over the pre<Col N="780" /> vious year, whether reported or not reported to the gardaí. No questions were asked about sexual assault or domestic violence as it was felt they would not be appropriate to this type of survey. The questions were agreed by an advisory group comprising representatives from the CSO, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Economic and Social Research Institute, Trinity College, the North-Eastern Health Board and the National Council on Ageing and Older People. This information has been compiled from the Quarterly National Household Survey, which surveys 3,000 households each week. It also did a survey on housing during the previous quarter and both results should be available in the middle of this year. When Deputy Higgins was Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach he was instrumental in getting the Central Statistics Office to commence the survey on crime and victimisation.</P>

      <P>In compiling the national income estimates, the CSO aims to ensure all aspects of relevant economic activity are covered. To do this it assesses the reliability and comprehensiveness of the basic data sources and, where necessary, makes upward adjustments to capture income not adequately covered. The extent and nature of these adjustments vary depending on the components of gross domestic produce involved. For example, in the case of farm income the initial estimate is thought to be comprehensive and no upward adjustment is made. It is calculated as the difference between total agriculture output and inputs and is not based on individual farmers' returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of wages and salaries, the basic data sources are statistical surveys. The results are then grossed up to a control total based on the <Col N="781" /> number of employees in the Quarterly National Household Survey, whether part-time, full-time, in second jobs, seasonal workers and so on. This ensures an income is applied to all employees economically active in the State.</P>
    <P>However, for other estimates, such as self-employed profits, where the primary data source is income tax declarations, specific adjustments are made. For example, profits are attributed to those not captured in the tax system by adjusting upwards to the numbers in the Quarterly National Household Survey and an allowance is then made for under reporting of profits by making an uplift to the basic income declared.</P>
    <P>The CSO tries to ensure that all relevant incomes are captured in its estimates of national income. In accordance with European standards, income arising from illegal production activities, such as drug dealing, is not included in the national accounts. The compilation system does not itself provide a direct measure of the black economy. To do this the tax collection system would need to be the starting point for measuring all components of gross domestic product. This is not the case. Consequently, such black market activities cannot be separately evaluated. The adjustment made, however, while not amounting to a measure of the black economy amounts to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concerns the Deputy has raised and I am aware of the tax burden facing individuals, especially on inheritance of the family home. During the Dáil debate on the Finance Bill I undertook to examine the capital acquisitions tax code in detail prior to the next budget. I want to see if we can come up with a solution that alleviates the tax burden and, at the same time, is fair to all who face similar circumstances in relation to CAT on the domestic residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it must be remembered that any changes in the CAT area are costly. The yield from inheritance tax was £77.5 million for 1998. This revenue greatly assists the Government's programme and helps achieve the ongoing goal of reducing the tax take on employment incomes. For this reason, any significant changes to the CAT must be considered in a budgetary context <Col N="782" /> when choices have to be made on which elements of the tax system to address.</P>
    <P>To accommodate concerns about the inheritances of property, which have increased in value as a result of the recent rise in house prices, the various class thresholds would have to be significantly increased. At present a child can inherit up to £192,900 from his or her parents free of capital acquisitions tax. This exempt amount is described as the class I threshold. Smaller thresholds apply to gifts or inheritances received from other close relatives &ndash; class II, £25,720 &ndash; and from others not covered by these two thresholds &ndash; class III, £12,860. Only the value of benefits received in excess of the relevant threshold gives rise to a charge to capital acquisitions tax. Transfers between spouses do not give rise to CAT. Since 1990 these thresholds have been indexed annually by reference to the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Apart from the significant Exchequer costs involved by greatly increasing the amount of wealth which could be passed free of tax, there is also the question of tax equity to be considered. Significantly increasing the thresholds would benefit only those who receive substantial inheritances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if full allowance was made for increases in the cost of housing in the years since the present rate of inheritance tax was introduced, family homes valued up to £1 million would be exempt? Does he accept that present thresholds are totally out of line with the kind of regime envisaged by his predecessors when the tax was introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of capital acquisitions tax in the early 1970s was a significant departure from the estate duties system, which existed until then. The changes to the new system were worthwhile. I accept the value of property has increased substantially above the thresholds then envisaged and the increases in thresholds over the years are not in line with what would have happened if we had indexed property prices to the levels that pertained at the start of the code. As I indicated during the debate on the Finance Bill, prior to the next budget, I intend to undertake a fundamental review of the whole area of capital acquisitions tax to address a number of anomalies in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for again renewing his undertaking in that regard. However, I ask him to give a commitment that persons covered by the class II threshold, including relatives such as brothers and sisters, will be favourably considered in the review. The Minister will be aware, as we all are from cases in our constituencies, of the difficulties that arise when the family home has to be passed to a brother or sister. Before the colossal increases in house prices, the thresholds were reasonable for the direct line of descent, whether up or down. However, they are very onerous on a lateral beneficiary, such as <Col N="783" /> a brother or sister. I ask the Minster to consider this aspect with a view to abolishing the class II threshold and incorporating it into class I.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have my own views, developed over a long period of time, on this area. I will consider the Deputy's suggestions. I am aware of problems that have arisen due to the low class II threshold as it applies to transfers between brothers and sisters.</P>
      <P>Changes and concessions have been made over the years, by me and my predecessors, to alleviate some of these problems. However, I am strongly of the view it is time to carry out a fundamental review of this whole area. This would include consideration of some of the Deputy's suggestions and I will be glad to accept representations from him, including examples which would strengthen my case, when I undertake a far reaching review before the next Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be worthwhile to consider the favourite nephew and niece provision of the code with a view to extending it to persons who act in those capacities but who are not blood relatives. There are anomalies in that category also. Even though we share the Minister's view that inheritance tax has brought a lot of revenue to the Exchequer in recent years, it has been an accidental bonus of rising house prices. The money raised in 1998, to which the Minister referred, was not forecast in the budget of that year. It is part of the general buoyancy in revenue. It is bad practice to consider accidental revenue buoyancy as part of the <i>status quo</i> and the Minister's review should take this into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is fully aware of the increased pressures in the labour market. These pressures apply at both the higher skilled and lower skilled ends of the market. As the Deputy will recall, skill shortages are being addressed through a marked increase in investment in technological education and training. An additional £280 million was provided in a special fund for scientific and technological education and research and development for this purpose, and a further £75 million for capital investment at third level. The results of this investment will become increasingly evident in the labour market in the near future. More recently, FÁS initiated <Col N="786" /> a proactive programme with a target of attracting Irish citizens and EU nationals to meet increased demand for skilled labour in construction, IT, electronics and teleservices.</P>
      <P>As regards the less skilled end of the market, the Government took a radical approach to taxation of the low paid in the budget last December. The result was not only to remove 80,000 workers entirely from the tax net but to greatly increase the financial incentive for the unemployed to take up open market jobs as against remaining on social welfare.</P>
      <P>There are a host of other measures either being implemented or under consideration, such as the National Employment Action Plan, which is being updated for 1999, and the various proposals in relation to participation by women in the workforce. An interdepartmental group of officials, the Strategy Group for Employment and Unemployment, also advises the Government on the main strategic requirements.</P>
      <P>The fact that our unemployment rate is now down to about 6 per cent illustrates the success of our policies. We intend to continue with further active policy initiatives, as required, in this area so that we can ensure that the labour market continues to respond to the opportunities increasingly evident in the marketplace.</P>

Has the Minister any specific proposals on tax changes or child care which would encourage more married women to participate in the labour force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not necessarily agree that the only constraining factor to the continued growth of the economy is the availability of workers. I would give it a high rating in the number of factors, which also include infrastructural deficits and other areas, that might constrain the economy. I agree with the Deputy that it is a constraining factor. We must remember we have moved fairly rapidly from a time when unemployment was a scourge and the main consideration was to create jobs at all costs to the other end of the market where we are gladly talking abut these problems associated with success. I am sure neither Deputy Noonan nor I thought ten years ago that we would ever be in this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a wide range of measures available to it. The Deputy referred to taxation and that is one of the factors the Government will consider. The number of women participating in our workforce has increased more or less to the level of the European norm in recent years, but it is still below the average level of northern European countries. The Deputy is correct in that <Col N="787" /> there is a pool of available workers and we will consider a wide range of initiatives to encourage some of the people to whom the Deputy referred back into the workforce.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that when a married woman returns to work she usually has to pay the higher rate of income tax and the fact that the 46 per cent rate applies at such a low level of income prohibits many married women from returning to the workplace?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the tax rate is a consideration for some married women who decide at a certain stage to return to the workforce. As the Deputy will be aware, the reason they come into the tax net at a higher rate is that their allowance would have been assumed by their spouses. This raises the question of how we should address the taxation code in the future. I accept that it is a disincentive for women returning to the workforce to have to pay the 46 per cent tax rate immediately. It is difficult to find a way of overcoming this problem without causing more difficulties in the area of taxation. However, I accept it is a problem.</P>

      <P>In section 61 of the 1999 Finance Act, I extended the tax relief for investment in films provided by section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, for a further year to 5 April 2000. While concern has been expressed by the film sector regarding the proposed one year extension to the relief in question, speculation that this extension puts the future continuation of the relief into question is not justified. This extension will enable the Government to fully consider the contents of a number of reports on the film sector that are to be published shortly. Rolling the reliefs forward does not mean the end of the film relief. It is a valuable incentive to film making here and is recognised as such by the Government. It is intended that the relief will continue to work to secure the Government's aims for the industry and the publication of the special reports on the industry by the Government and their subsequent detailed consideration is the best way to address the appropriate policies for State support in this area.</P>

I said during the budget that on foot of a report I received I was prepared to extend this tax relief for another year, which I did in the Finance Bill. The report commissioned referred to a number of other measures which could be taken to the benefit of film making, other than a tax incentive. I do not know whether other Members are involved in these tax breaks but the report showed this is the best one. One must take into account equity among various sectors of taxpayers. The tax break given to those who invest in what was known as section 35 film relief is the best available. As a former chartered accountant, that is my free advice.</P>

      <P>That is the type of statement which is causing confusion. The lack of clarity in the Minister's reply will send a shiver throughout the industry. Is the Minister aware that 2,000 people are employed by the film industry full-time and 4,000 part-time? The tax the Exchequer is losing because of section 481 is more than made up by the revenue generated by the film industry. For example, the Isle of Man has increased its incentives by 25 per cent and even California, the home of the film industry, is now introducing tax incentives to keep film production at home. The Minister is destroying the film industry. He may not be aware of that but it is the perception. Will he clearly state the Government's commitment to the industry?</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the industry but is also committed to equity between taxpayers. I accept this has been an outstanding relief for investors. It is the best relief at present, by a long way. We must take into account the benefit to the economy and individual taxpayers. No-one disputes the benefit to investors in this scheme. However, whether the benefit to the economy as a whole is as good as the benefit to investors is a different question.</P>

    <P>I do not accept there is a lack of clarity in this matter. I said what I am saying now quite clearly during the debate on the Finance Bill and on previous occasions. I have a clear view of this matter <Col N="789" /> in any event. It is a case of whether we are prepared to give a large tax break to a small number of taxpayers and whether the cost of doing that is equivalent to the benefits which accrue to the economy as a whole. That question was deliberated on by the consultants and is also being considered by other sectors of the film industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's contribution to the EU in respect of the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 is estimated as follows; 2000, £788 million, 2001, £796 million and 2002, £829 million. This is based on the current &ldquo;Own Resources&rdquo; decision which is due to be revised with effect from 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this juncture to give precise estimates on a year by year basis of Ireland's receipts from the EU for the period to 2002. Ireland's estimated allocation under the Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period 2000-06, arising from the Berlin Summit, amounts to approximately £3.4 billion. This figure includes an estimate for headage payments receipts. These receipts will be funded from the agriculture heading of the EU budget in the next financial perspective, whereas they are currently funded from the Structural and Cohesion Funds heading. The level of transfers to Ireland under the CAP is estimated to be in the region of £10 billion over the period 2000-06, although this figure is by its nature tentative, given the dependence of CAP receipts on developments in the marketplace over the next seven years.</P>
      <P>Other than some carry-overs under the existing Community Support Framework, the inflow of Structural and Cohesion Funds either on a year by year or on a programme by programme basis will not be finalised until the completion of the National Development Plan and its approval by the European Commission in the form of the Community Support Framework. Preparation of the National Development Plan, NDP, 2000-2006 is ongoing and the current aim is, if possible, to finalise the plan before the end of July.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that a precise profile of Ireland's EU receipts out to 2002 is not available, it is clear that Ireland will remain a substantial net beneficiary over these years, and that over the whole period of the next financial perspective Ireland's EU receipts will significantly exceed our EU contributions.</P>

      <P>I do not have that information with me. I gave that information in a recent reply and it was definitely in the public domain coming up to the Berlin Summit. The question asked today was to ascertain the estimate of the Irish contribution in the next three years and the estimated inflow of funds in the same period. I will get the information for the Deputy. From my recollection during the negotiations, on a <i>per capita</i> basis we were way above the largest net beneficiary of the EU primarily because of CAP receipts. Graphs were produced coming up to the Berlin Summit and discounting CAP receipts there was a fairly even spread across members on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>

However, will the national plan break down the inflow on a programme by programme basis? Given that the Minister has advice available to him from the ESRI in relation to the national plan, I invite him to comment on the suggestion that expenditure on employment support and tourism support will be reduced.</P>

About £440 million will come from Cohesion Funding and roughly £118 million from Community initiatives. <Col N="791" /> The balance will come from the change in the agricultural receipts.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The question of restoring pensions parity does not arise since it has not been removed.</P>
      <P>The position is that in June 1997, in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to protect public service pensions. In November 1997 the Government announced that the benefit of the restructuring pay deals under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work  would apply on the basis of parity to public servants who had retired before the commencement dates. However, to protect those retired public servants who would have received less than 3 per cent had parity been applied in the normal way, the Government decided, as a one-off measure, that pensioners should be guaranteed a minimum increase of 3 per cent &ndash; or 2 per cent in the case of any pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent. The Government also announced that, because those restructuring pay deals posed major difficulties in applying parity, it was referring the matter to the Commission on Public Service Pensions.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision in November 1997, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines for dealing with cases. Initially, there were difficulties in interpreting how these guidelines applied to certain groups of pensioners, particularly in the local authority and health board areas. These issues were subsequently resolved and my Department, along with other Departments, made every effort to ensure that public sector bodies implemented fully the terms of the Government decision.</P>
      <P>The issues now being pursued by certain pensioner groups dispute aspects of settled pensions parity policy. For example, they want long service increments paid to certain serving staff on a personal basis under their PCW restructuring pay deals to be passed on to retired personnel. My Department has made it clear from the beginning that it is a core element of pensions parity policy that such payments are not passed on to pensioners because they are not a permanent feature of the pay scale. This was one of the key criteria set out in the guidelines issued to Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated, Government policy on PCW restructuring deals has been determined primarily <Col N="792" /> on the basis of adhering as closely as possible to parity as traditionally applied, but with certain adjustments to protect the position of those groups of pensioners who would otherwise lose out because of the nature and complexity of the pay deals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Pensions Board still discussing aspects of parity which were referred to it by the Department of Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The McAleese commission was set up in 1996. It gave me its interim report in early 1998. It had hoped to submit its final report before the end of 1998 but, due to the complexity of its work, it will not be due until later this year. The McAleese commission on public service pensions addresses a wide range of issues, as the Deputy is aware because he was in Government when it was set up it. This is one of the matters it will address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the continuing difficulty with parity relates to long service increments, as the Minister said, and special allowances. How many pensioners are affected by the failure to apply parity in these areas? What is the likely cost to the Exchequer of applying parity in the way the pensioners are asking? Does the Minister not agree that the people primarily affected are former clerical officers in the local authorities and their equivalent in the health boards, who are hardly well paid workers even now, and that the amount of money involved is very small?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the details on the numbers involved. However, the cost issue is not the primary consideration &ndash; it is the principle involved. It is a serious principle regarding pensions policy that has been settled since the year dot. It was not brought in by this or the previous Minister for Finance but has always been there. A core element of pensions parity policy is that only permanent changes or additions to pay scales are passed on to pensioners. That was the situation long before my time. When I brought in this deal in November 1997 many pension groups expected me to not do it. I commend the public sector&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I sent people off on a dummy run. One group issued a statement saying that I had done what some people anticipated I would do. The floor I brought in was welcomed by the public service committee of ICTU which had recommended that provision. The matter was under consideration for some time by the previous Government. I am not saying the previous Government funked the issue as it is a very complex area. We found an acceptable formula, which I announced in November 1997. I do not mind pensioners' groups lobbying as it is part of <Col N="793" /> the process, but some of them are trying to overturn pensions parity policy which has been settled since the foundation of the State. I cannot relent on that issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Public Service Pensions was established in February 1996 and made its interim report in November 1997. The commission was originally asked to make its final report to Government in 1998. However, due to its wide ranging terms of reference, which require it to consider pension provisions across the whole Public Service, the commission has not found it possible to adhere to this deadline. I expect the commission will be in a position to submit its final report within the next few months.</P>
      <P>The question of implementing any recommendations which may be contained in the commission's report will be considered once the report has been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the issue of funding public service pensions into the future and making prior arrangements for such funding is contained in the pensions report. In a number of responses to parliamentary questions in the past six months, and in his budget statement and the supplementary material provided with it, the Minister implied that surpluses currently available to Government would be used for the purpose of making such provision. Will the Minister confirm that is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The range of issues to be considered in the commission's report will include pension funding. When the commission was set <Col N="794" /> up in 1996 its terms of reference were to examine a report on the pension terms of public servants employed in the Civil Service, non-industrial and industrial sectors, Defence Forces, Garda, education, health and local authority services, having regard to the present and future costs arising under schemes financed by the Exchequer. The matter will be addressed by the pensions commission.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the second issue in the past. While we have a different demographic profile to the rest of Europe, we have an opportunity to examine these problems. I commend the last Government for setting up the McAleese commission which will address one of these problems.</P>
      <P>At a separate level, we are also looking at the pre-funding of State social welfare pensions. While the demographics are in our favour, we should look at this rather than fall into the problem, as happened in the rest of Europe. There are problems with public service pensions but they will not occur until 2010.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Frequently people talk about funding pensions for teachers, civil servants and gardaí who now contribute to their pension schemes although the Government does not retain a pension fund in the Exchequer. Other people are talking about those who pay PRSI and argue that there should be an insurance fund for pensions and other withdrawals from PRSI. I would like the Minister to distinguish between the two and to comment on his thinking on both areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct. There are two problems which are sometimes confused in the public mind. There is the funding of civil and public servants' pensions, the area on which the McAleese commission will report, and there is also an interdepartmental working group established as a result of the National Pensions Policy Initiative, under the auspices of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which is examining the idea of setting up a fund for social welfare pensions. They are two distinct funds. Both matters are being considered.</P>
      <P>What I said earlier still applies. Due to our demographic profile, we have an opportunity to address both problems. With good economic growth and budget surpluses, it is time we looked at them. Other European countries fell into that problem. We can avoid that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The McAleese commission will not investigate or make recommendations on social welfare pensions. As both the PRSI Vote and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs Vote are now in surplus, this is a budgetary matter and the Minister would be well <Col N="795" /> advised to set up such a fund. He could consider this for the next budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The McAleese commission only deals with public service pensions. When the National Pensions Policy Initiative reported to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, two working groups were set up. One of them is looking at this matter. The Deputy made a valid point about the surplus in the social insurance fund. That could be considered. Later this year, however, the working group will report on social welfare pensions and the McAleese commission will report on public service pensions. We can make provisions then. My views on the matters are well known.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, at a meeting with the social partners in July 1998, said that there was a need for a change in the way public service pay is managed in the period after the Partnership 2000 agreement and invited the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to participate in discussions on the future of public service pay determination and how, in that context, pay might be aligned more closely with performance.</P>
      <P>The Public Services Committee of ICTU and representatives of the main public service employers have met on a number of occasions to discuss a range of issues including pay determination and the issue of relating pay to performance. The discussions are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has commissioned a consultancy study on the issue which would look at approaches to pay determination in the public service internationally and in the private sector, <Col N="796" /> and how the approaches identified could address the need for a new approach to public service pay determination in Ireland. The study will be completed by the end of July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been precious little progress on this issue since the Minister entered office. Does he agree that implementation of a performance related pay system within the Civil Service is an essential part of the SMI process and that that process will go nowhere unless there is some means of assessing performance related pay? Will the Minister give an indication of the rank within the Civil Service at which he sees performance related pay applying? At present it applies at Assistant Secretary level. Is it intended that it will apply at a lower level in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to distinguish between two different, but interrelated, concepts. There have been ongoing discussions with the Civil Service unions for some time regarding a performance management system. Separately, last July when the Taoiseach addressed the plenary session of the social partners, he referred to performance related pay and getting out of the relativity problem which has bedevilled the public service for so long. We should soon be in a position to finalise our discussions with the Civil Service unions on a performance related system.</P>
      <P>Performance related pay will have to be discussed in the context of the next national agreement. I do not underestimate the difficulties of coming up with a system for this. I read the comments made by some trade union leaders which pointed out some of the difficulties and I sympathise with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>At what level does the Minister envisage performance related pay being instituted? I agree with what the Minister said but he gave a similar response 18 months ago and there has been very little progress made since then.</P>

      <P>The negotiations with the trade unions on the performance management system started before I became Minister for Finance. The question as to the level performance at which related pay will apply will have to be discussed in the context of the next national agreement. We will see then if we can come up with an acceptable system. I do not underestimate the problems which will arise when trying to do this. The Taoiseach has put it on the agenda and everyone on the union side is for it in principle. Working out a way to do it will be a major task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue job assist scheme was introduced in April last year to complement the wide range of schemes already available to assist the long-term unemployed back into employment. The scheme is a focused two part initiative which gives the long-term unemployed an incentive to take up employment and gives potential employers an incentive to employ a long-term unemployed person as opposed to someone else in the labour market. This scheme has not been extended to cater for certain persons with disabilities since the start of this year.</P>
      <P>According to statistics produced by the Revenue Commissioners for the 1998-99 year of assessment, covering the 12 month period from 6 April 1998 to 5 April 1999, a total of 1,112 cases had been issued a tax free allowance which included the job assist scheme in that period. Of the 1,112 cases, a total of 132 cases were no longer in employment at the end of that year of assessment. This represents a drop out rate of nearly 12 per cent. While, ideally, I would prefer if all the people who had benefited from this scheme had remained in full-time employment, the fact that 88 per cent of them were still employed at the end of the first year of operation of the scheme is most encouraging. Furthermore, in the first four weeks of the current tax year an additional 344 cases have now availed of the scheme and further details of these recent cases will shortly be available from Revenue.</P>
      <P>The Revenue job assist scheme is working satisfactorily, both in dealing with the difficulties faced by the persons who are long-term unemployed from another angle, and in complementing the wide range of back to work incentives already available to this category of persons. The scheme has met a clear need since its introduction last year and I assure the Deputy its operation will continue to be closely monitored.</P>

Perhaps he can refresh my memory and tell my the number of places which were provided for. It seems to me that it was in excess of the 11,000 or so which have been taken up. How much money is being provided in the current year for up-take of the scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <P>I am nearly certain that I did not state a number of places because, as I said at the time, it was an experiment but I can look up the record. I do not want to be too categorical about this. It seems to have worked well. It was a targeted scheme to try to tackle the problem <Col N="798" /> long-term unemployment by giving a clear incentive to the employer to go after a long-term unemployed person as opposed to employing a person seeking a job in the normal way. In that sense there was a clear intent to distort the labour market. On the other hand it gives an incentive to the long-term unemployed person to take up employment by giving him or her an additional tax free allowance, which is also a clear intent to distort the labour market at that end because two people working side by side in similar circumstances would have two different tax rates. It has worked well.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that during the 12 months or so in which the scheme has been in operation more than 17,000 people who have been unemployed for more than one year have left the live register and taken up employment? Why have they not qualified for it? He is giving it to less than one in 16 of those eligible people. What effort is he making to promote the scheme among the long-term unemployed? By accident I have come across numerous people who have left the live register who did not know they were entitled to it. The Minister's Department is failing in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I introduced the scheme to my Department I said there was not much point in introducing this initiative, which was my idea, if nobody knew about it. The Deputy will recall that last year the Revenue Commissioners conducted an advertising campaign announcing the scheme on radio for serveral weeks &ndash; I heard the radio advertisements.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that many of the long-term unemployed who have gone back to work have not known about the scheme, but one would have thought that the employer would have known about it because there is a clear benefit for the employer also. He is entitled to claim double the cost of taking on those long-term unemployed people, but maybe the labour market is so buoyant and profits are so good that the employers are not worried about it either.</P>
      <P>There is an anomaly, as the Deputy pointed out. The figures for long-term unemployment have fallen to a little over 3 per cent. Therefore, a great many long-term unemployed people have taken up employment and have not availed of this. I am delighted they are back working and cost the Exchequer less, but this is available to them if they so wish.</P>

      <P>High interest economies would, effectively, be economies outside the euro 11 area. Figures from the Central Bank show that in the period to end March, the latest date for which such data are available, residents deposits increased by 3.8 per cent and holding by other monetary union residents and rest of the world resident deposits declined marginally by 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. Such figures do not suggest that there is a flight of capital from the economy to high interest economies.</P>
      <P>Movements in the level of non-resident holdings of Government bonds is another possible indicator, but data available for non-resident holdings do not distinguish between euro area and rest of the world residents. Nevertheless, the most up-to-date information available shows that non-resident holdings have been reasonably steady since the beginning of this year at 22.7 per cent, 24.4 per cent, 22.9 per cent and 23.5 per cent of outstanding bonds respectively for each of the months January to April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The reason is that the Government's ability to influence the flow of <Col N="800" /> funds ceased with the abolition of exchange control regulations in 1992. The second reason is that as and from 1 January last the European Central Bank sets the interest rate which was set previously by the Central Bank. One of the Treaty rules setting up the European Central Bank is that nobody, including national central banks, will influence the European Central Bank in the setting of its interest rate. Therefore, there would be no such plans but it is highly unlikely that it would happen in the current climate.</P>

      <P>A review of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme is being undertaken by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to determining what modifications, if any, might be proposed to the current scheme. The existing medical criteria for qualification &ndash;<Col N="801" /> set out in the first schedule primary medical certificate &ndash; may be among the items examined by the group. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, that the group hopes to furnish its report for consideration prior to the summer recess.</P>
      <P>The current scheme is costly and opening it up to wider ranges of disabilities would significantly add to that cost.

I urge the Minister to consider the situation to ensure genuine cases, such as the one to which I refer, have available to them, the transport to which they are entitled.

The regulations are set and a person goes before a medical officer who completes a primary medical certificate outlining whether the person satisfies the criteria. This has nothing to do with the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance. Deputy Crawford seems to be suggesting that the criteria should be extended. The interdepartmental group has been sitting for some time and is due to report shortly. However, I caution against the expectation that this scheme will be open to people with all forms of disability.

      <P>Yes, I did. However, I also pointed to the hue and cry which ensued when former Ministers for Finance and former Ministers for Health attempted to do something about this scheme. The people who qualify under the scheme do not want any of the concessions to be changed. A root and branch review would not alone entail examining the criteria but also the form the scheme would take.</P>
      <P>The difficulty arises from the fact that the scheme is very generous. One could broaden the criteria if one reduced the generosity of the scheme. As a result of the uproar which occurred when attempts were made to make some changes to the scheme many years ago, the scheme was not changed.</P>

As a result of previous deliberations, new quite specific and restrictive regulations were published in 1994. However, the cost of the scheme has increased each year. There are many alternatives to addressing this problem. Other countries do not have a scheme like this. Some opt for a grant system. This scheme has been so attractive that if one were to change it, all hell would break loose. That must be taken into account.</P>

      <P>Work is ongoing in my Department on developing proposals for Government on priorities and overall resources for the National Development Plan 2000-06. While I am not in a position to go into details of the plan, I confirm that the Government is committed to mainstreaming gender equality and, in this con<Col N="803" /> text, I assure the Deputy that this issue will be incorporated into the national development plan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Taoiseach and I today met representatives of the community and voluntary pillar who set out their concerns about gender mainstreaming. This follows a meeting I had with this pillar in January last to discuss the plan, at which the issue of gender mainstreaming was also raised.</P>
      <P>This reply was drafted last night at which point it was intended that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and I would meet representatives of the community and voluntary pillar. The Taoiseach and I met them but the Tánaiste was indisposed.</P>

      <P>The community and voluntary pillar pressed for poverty proofing over several years and that is now incorporated into all Government proposals. In the same way, the pillar wants the next national development plan to incorporate gender proofing across every aspect of the plan. At our meeting with representatives of the pillar this morning, a particular area was not singled out. They wanted the entire plan to be examined in microscopic detail from the point of view of gender proofing. That will be done.</P>

      <P>My Department dealt with the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the appointed consultants on two fronts in relation to this report. First, in its central advisory role, through the Centre for Management and Organisational Development &ndash; CMOD &ndash; and second, as an individual Department under examination, through its IT unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department met representatives of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office on six occasions about this report prior to its publication. CMOD attended an initial briefing by the Comptroller and Auditor General on its proposed value for money study on 8 April 1998. Clarification of the role of the interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee was provided. On 30 June 1998, the IT unit of my Department attended a meeting to clarify the objectives of the value for money examination. On 21 July 1998, CMOD provided the consultants, engaged by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="804" /> General to conduct the examination, with clarification on the roles of the interdepartmental monitoring committee and CMOD. On 6 August 1998, clarification was provided to the IT unit on the detail of a questionnaire provided by the consultants. Clarification of the IT structure in my Department and the different roles of the IT unit and CMOD was provided to the consultants. On 8 October 1998, a meeting was held to discuss the consultants' queries on the Department's completed questionnaire. On 17 December 1998, CMOD provided comments to the Comptroller and Auditor General on the initial draft of its report.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department responded to all queries from that office and the consultants engaged by them to conduct the examination, making available any documents or files requested by them. My Department also provided written comments on an early draft of the report.</P>

      <P>The decision to end duty free sales for intra-Community travellers has been enacted into European law and is scheduled to come into effect on 30 June 1999. Any alteration in this arrangement would require a proposal, in the first instance from the EU Commission, and unanimous agreement at Council. To date, the Commission has not put forward such a proposal, nor has the unanimous agreement of Council on this issue been expressed. It is probable that this issue will be discussed again at the European Council in Cologne. Sales of duty free goods to passengers travelling to destinations outside the EU are not affected.</P>

      <P>Why was time not provided to discuss this issue at the Berlin meeting? It seems it was not on the agenda.

      <P>Ireland has led the way in pushing forward this matter. For a long time we were the only country up front about it. In the past year other countries have come on side, particularly the major countries such as Germany and France. For example, at yesterday's ECOFIN meeting a request was made by France to have the matter debated again, but it was turned down. The matter was debated but the position remains the same. The German Chancellor, Mr. Schröder, who is the current President of Council, said it will be discussed at the Cologne summit next week by the Heads of Government. There is a negative attitude among Finance Ministers at <Col N="805" /> ECOFIN towards the majority countries on this issue, as we discovered on many occasions. I led a debate on this matter in 1998 and since then more people have come on side. There will be a final opportunity next week in Cologne when the matter will be discussed by the Heads of State and we will certainly push to have the decision reversed, as we have done in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the game is up on this issue. Assuming that is the case, will the Minister indicate if the Government has put in place any plans to minimise the effects in Ireland of the loss of duty free sales? As he knows, the KPMG report established that there was a threat to a considerable number of jobs and that many sales would be lost. Will the Minister indicate whether his or any other Department have plans in train to minimise the effects?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly points out, the Government commissioned the KPMG study which outlined the Irish position and we forwarded that to Europe. The difficulty has been that the Commission was against the idea of commissioning a report. When the Commission was asked by the Vienna Council to examine this matter, it stated, in its March report, that it would be prepared to consider requests from member states on any European measure that could be used to alleviate some of the difficulties, although the Commission continued with its hard-line approach that the decision had to stand. I am sure this matter will be discussed at the Cologne conference next week when both Germany and France intend to pursue it, and they are the major players.</P>

Fáiltím roimh an Bille seo sa tslí go dtaispeánann sé dúinn gur féidir linn tosú ar an mbun agus leanúint ar aghaidh agus cáilíochtaí oideachais agus traenála a bhaint amach sa tír seo agus fios againn go mbeidh siad aitheanta ní hamháin sa tír seo ach aitheanta freisin go forleathan agus leasmuigh.</P>
      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill is the result of wide-ranging discussion with all the interested parties, the providers of education and training both at third level and further education level, universities, institutes and industry. The objects of the Bill are designed to establish and develop standards of knowledge, skills and competence. It will provide for a system of co-ordinating education and training awards, the promotion of the quality of education and training and of access, transfer and progression. The objects also provide for the promotion of co-operation between providers and industry, recognition outside the State of awards made by bodies in the State and recognition in the State of awards made outside the State, and diversity in education and training. It also provides that every body and person concerned with the implementation should have regard to the objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will ensure that three different groups are set up. These groups will guarantee access, co-operation between different bodies and, more importantly, recognition. The three groups being established are the National Qualifications Authority, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. The membership of each of these groups gives us an indication of the emphasis in their deliberations. Not only will the Minister for Education and Science be represented on each body &ndash; that is obvious &ndash; but also the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the education providers and groups such as Forfás, the trade unions and IBEC who will guarantee that the important link between employment and training, and education and work, is maintained. Most importantly, in each of these groups, learners are presented because the <Col N="808" /> system would not be what it is without the students. We should always aim to protect the rights of the learners, as this Bill will do.</P>
    <P>The National Qualifications Authority is designed to maintain a framework of qualifications for developing and recognising qualifications based on standards of knowledge, skills or competence to be acquired by the learner. The words &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, &ldquo;skills&rdquo; and &ldquo;competence&rdquo; are much broader than we have recognised in our education system to date. Our emphasis may have been too much on knowledge whereas we will now give important national and international recognition to skills and competence.  It is very important that this recognition is at a national level. I often wonder about the standard of some of the qualifications given by, for example, English colleges and the A levels where the standard often depends on where the qualification is obtained. By establishing the National Qualifications Authority we will at least be able to stand over the procedures and ensure due recognition is given to courses.</P>
    <P>A Further Education and Training Awards Council is also being established. Further education has become very popular in the past few years with courses for adults, communities and learners of different standards and levels of knowledge. It is important that these courses are validated and that standards remain high. In particular, I welcome the inclusion of groups outside the formal education system, such as FÁS, CERT, Teagasc, BIM and second level schools.</P>
    <P>The introduction in recent years of the leaving certificate applied, the vocational leaving certificate, the transition year and the myriad of post-leaving certificate courses have opened the way for a wide variety of skills and competences to be taught in second level schools. It is important, therefore, that quality is assured. We will depend totally on the expertise of individual teachers for as long as it is left to individual schools. This may lead to a wide variety of standards as well as a wide variety of course subjects. I welcome the inclusion of second level schools in this section. The Higher Education and Training Awards Council sets out the same policies and standards for third level institutions and universities.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes transparent the ladder of access which crosses the binary divide and facilitates the progression of students from the vocational sector to higher qualifications, including degrees offered by the university sector. It is important that a ladder of access exists and that its functions are regulated in a manner which defends the integrity of the educational awards referred to. Having been involved in the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology and as chairperson of the Dublin Institute of Technology, Cathal Brugha Street, for six years, I appreciate the value of a ladder of access from apprenticeship courses up to degree level.</P>
    <P>The House will recognise that the binary system has served us well. The Minister and the Department have defended the policy of main<Col N="809" /> taining a university and a technology sector as a means of ensuring a wide spread of educational qualifications and a wide geographical spread of institutions. This is not intended to maintain or create a ranked hierarchy of esteem between the different types of providers but is a reasoned policy of ensuring the distinct identities and objects of each sector.</P>
    <P>The technology sector in the form of Regional Technical Colleges has done much to provide the skills base for modern Irish industry through the provision of vocational awards and, in some cases, degrees. Universities have as their main function, the graduation of degree holders at bachelor, masters or doctorate levels. Together, the seven universities and eleven institutes of technology have a complementary role to play in providing a well balanced and extensive range of offerings in higher education.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a distinction between the existing seven universities and any future universities which may be created under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997. This is an explicit acknowledgement of the autonomy guaranteed to universities by that Act and a recognition that any future universities will be likely to emerge from a multi-layered pre-existence and, in becoming universities, their responsibility to non-degree offerings will not be forfeited.</P>
    <P>In general, existing universities have welcomed the provisions of the Bill and undertaken to co-operate with the National Qualifications Authority in developing mechanisms to facilitate access from the providers of technological training. As a member of the senate of the National University of Ireland, I welcome the fact that universities are to be included in the membership of the National Qualifications Authority. Their constructive input will be of inestimable value to the new authority, as will those of the other groups I mentioned in ensuring that programmes are developed and implemented.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the fact that the Bill includes a section dedicated to learners. The profile of learners has changed over the past few years. A learner is not just the traditional second level student studying for the junior or leaving certificate, applied or vocational. There is now a demand for places in further education and it is vital that guarantees are given to students that when they put a foot on the ladder of education, they know where they can go. It must be clear to them from the beginning that access is there, that a transfer is available and that a progression can be made.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that advance information must be given to students. This information needs to be given to people at the beginning of their educational training. It is not good enough that students who undertake a course, hopefully with the intention of continuing from certificate to diploma or from diploma to degree, should be stopped at any of those stages, as has happened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> I also recognise that, despite the wonderful education facilities provided by the State, there are also facilities provided by private companies. Students on these courses must be protected. The elements in the Bill which ensure a fund or insurance cover is maintained by private providers will ensure good courses and facilities are made available and that students are protected against the demise of individual colleges. Many private colleges have links with universities outside Ireland, I think particularly of the University of Wales. Perhaps at some future point we could consider whether these groups can be incorporated on the ladder of access.</P>
    <P>There are many new courses, new learners, and a growing adult education sector providing drugs awareness and counselling courses for community leaders. These people need our full support and we need to ensure the qualifications they obtain will be recognised in this country and abroad.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises and strengthens the current system. It will enhance the strength of the binary system through the establishment of a single national qualification system for all further education and training, including adult, community and continuing education and training. The new framework will play a central role in quality access and progression in the context of expanding provisions. However, despite all the new facilities, boards and structures, it is evident that, no matter what structures are created, the learner must always be to the fore in our deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill. This is one of the most important Bills to come before the House this session because of the need to streamline continuing and further education courses vital for the upskilling of the workforce and ensuring the young and the unemployed have the opportunity to gain worthwhile employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ninety seven per cent of firms are experiencing serious recruitment difficulties, yet 196,852 people are unemployed. Two thirds of companies state that the lack of basic skills, such as literacy, numerically and interpersonal skills, are the reasons they cannot fill vacancies. Only 47 per cent of Irish people aged between 26 and 54 years of age have completed second level education. This figure is significantly below the EU average. How can we tackle unemployment and staff shortages if we cannot ensure a basic level of education and proper access to further education? These statistics place a large burden on future economic growth. Ireland is in danger of falling behind other European countries which have recognised the economic importance of continuing educational training. Only 1 per cent of people with reading and writing problems use the literacy service. Without basic literacy skills, such people will neither obtain a job nor be able to access mainstream FÁS or CERT training programmes for the unemployed. Both FÁS and Teagasc encounter increasing literacy problems <Col N="811" /> among apprentices and have to run basic literacy education alongside their courses.</P>
    <P>In the information society, low literacy levels on the scale prevalent in Ireland serve to alienate a large proportion of the national population from the daily life of society. The development of a major programme of adult education with participation targets for disadvantaged people, tax relief for certain adult education courses and substantially more resources for the adult literacy service are urgently required. We need to increase participation of those groups which have been excluded from second and third level education. We must also ensure courses are organised on a flexible, part-time and year round basis.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about access &ndash; this is one of the principal elements of the Bill &ndash; we must ensure employers are committed to upskilling and to continuing education of their workforce. However, there is no mention of industry or employers in the Bill. RTE has a link with the Dublin Institute of Technology in terms of the MA in broadcasting, which is the first of its kind in Europe. The masters programme reflects the strategic plan of the faculty of applied arts to develop closer links with industry, provide professional level education and draw upon RTE's expertise to ensure the continuing relevance of the Dublin Institute of Technology's educational programmes. Another similar course run between the Dublin Institute of Technology and the ESB is the shift operatives' training development programme. It is the first of its kind in that the modules and content have been set by industry, namely, the power generation business within the ESB. This is the type of co-ordination and liaison between industry and providers of education which must be encouraged.</P>
    <P>A recent survey showed only 37 per cent of businesses have a staff training budget. Employers must commit greater resources to training as its importance cannot be sufficiently emphasised. Such investment will pay for itself in the long run and it is already doing so for a number of industries. However, there is also an onus on the providers of education. Work placements should be more actively promoted as part of all State-sponsored education and training programmes, including second level education.</P>
    <P>The survey also showed that, of the companies which hired graduates in the past 12 months, a worrying 46 per cent said they lacked related experience. It is a problem with many graduates that they do not have the relevant experience. They have the academic qualifications and have undertaken the research but they cannot use basic equipment such as a burette in a laboratory. I compliment the institutes of technology for the work they have done in this regard. I worked with some of their graduates in industry and learned a great deal from them, even though I had a degree. Employers complain that many graduates do not have the basic skills and cannot use a pH meter or a burette, for example, if they work in a <Col N="812" /> laboratory. These are basic requirements which must be fulfilled and the only way to do that is to ensure students receive work experience in industry.</P>
    <P>How can it be ensured the workforce has the necessary skills to progress within employment or avail of promotions as they arise unless upskilling is encouraged? With the Celtic tiger, employers find it increasingly difficult to fill skilled vacancies. Unless they are able to fill them internally, many of them will remain vacant. I spoke to a constituent of mine at the weekend who works in a technical company in Athlone. The staff are being offered £1,000 to find people to fill technical vacancies in the company. If a staff member is successful in doing that, they will receive £1,000, subject to the new employee staying on for six months. That is the type of situation we are approaching, yet 200,000 people remain unemployed. That is the other side of the spectrum. There is a shortage of staff in almost every industry, yet 200,000 people are unemployed. The only way this can be overcome is to give employers a strong voice in the training which the unemployed receive. There is no point training people who subsequently are still not qualified to avail of vacancies.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently stated that unemployment is no longer an issue. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that the National Youth Council of Ireland recently conducted a survey which showed that, in both the European and local elections, the most significant issue facing young people is employment and unemployment. They are still factors among young people and something we cannot neglect or ignore. Young unemployed people should be able to avail of retraining opportunities relevant to them and these should be on a non-coercive basis. We must try to encourage people to return to the education system. I know the Government is committed to this, but we must work on it. The two elements must be examined, namely, upskilling the workforce and ensuring the people who leave second level schools have the skills to avail of vacancies.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of protecting the quality of qualifications. He also said a key aim of the Bill is to promote international recognition of awards and international mobility. The Minister proposes to replace the National Council for Educational Awards and the National Council for Vocational Awards with the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the Further Education and Training Awards Council. The NCEA and the NCVA are internationally recognised, and employers who in the past employed competent individuals whose awards were recognised by these institutions will now find it very difficulty to accept a new qualification procedure. Twenty seven years of experience and 300,000 graduates will now be thrown out the window.</P>
    <P>How will a prospective employee of a German company, for example, explain to his prospective employer that the old accreditation system no longer exists and has been replaced by a new one <Col N="813" /> under which he has a qualification? Has consideration been given to the students who started their courses last year or in previous years, some of whom are sitting their final exams at the moment? Some of them do not know what qualification they will receive or its title. This will lead to a great deal of confusion. Many universities recently had the opportunity to change their names but many did not. For example, University College Dublin did not because the qualifications its graduates receive are internationally recognised. It did not want to change its name for fear its qualifications might no longer be internationally recognised.</P>
    <P>Employers will be hesitant about employing a person with a qualification from these new unheard of awards bodies. We are all aware that anyone can obtain a Ph.D. in whatever area one likes. All one has to do is log onto the Internet and, within an hour, one can have a doctorate in whatever one wants. Once $30 is deposited in an account in the name of a fictitious university on the Internet, the qualification is in the post. I could probably print out one if I tried but I have not yet done so. Fictitious qualifications are easily accessible, yet we are changing the names of two internationally recognised qualification certification authorities and effectively throwing the baby out with the bath water. To put the icing on the cake, people do not know whether they received their degrees from section 40 or section 41 universities. It will be interesting in ten years' time, presuming that I am not re-elected, if I travel to Germany in search of a job and an employer inquires whether I attended a section 40 or a section 41 university. How will people explain the difference? Either we have a rule for the universities or we do not; there cannot be two sets of rules.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin referred to the overwhelming welcome the Bill received from the universities. They gave it a welcome because there is nothing in it for them. They can proceed as they have in the past but the new universities will be obliged to comply with reams of regulations. Will these universities be provided with resources to enable them to complete the requisite paperwork? It has been stated that these institutions will be reviewed every five years. This will lead to a situation where one review finishes only for another to commence 18 months later.</P>
    <P>We must consider the two tier system being put in place in the education sector. I accept that the new universities will be different and that they will offer more applied courses and ensure that students gain the vital work experience to which I referred earlier. We must encourage the universities which do currently not offer placements to do so in the future. Why should the new universities be obliged to comply with rules and regulations different to those complied with by existing institutions? What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>This situation will give rise to confusion; it will not promote international recognition. With <Col N="814" /> regard to such recognition, we must be able to meet international standards. I know the Minister referred to this matter in his speech and that it is dealt with in the legislation. However, such recognition will not be gained by having a token individual with international experience on the national qualifications authority. We must put in place a proper system such as that which already exists in our universities. At present international examiners with international experience &ndash; they are usually from foreign universities &ndash; come to our universities to assess a sample number of examination papers completed by first to fourth year students. At the end of fourth year, students have an oral examination with an external examiner. If we are concerned with quality and recognition, we must put in place such a system. A stronger emphasis on international assessment will be required if we are to be successful in doing so and also in ensuring that courses and qualifications are recognised internationally.</P>
    <P>While I was attending university a great deal of concern arose in respect of the change of the titles of UCC, UCD, UCG and NUI Maynooth. Many students were worried while sitting their final examinations because they did not know what title would appear on their degrees. I accept that, regardless of the title, there is no change in the value of the degrees people receive. However, people continue to travel to continental Europe, the United States, Australia or Asia in search of employment. Perhaps employers in these countries offered employment to people from Ireland in the past but they will not now recognise the new qualifications. How will those people explain the new titles involved? Many foreign employers may not speak English and prospective employees from Ireland are obliged to be interviewed in a foreign language and explain the technicalities of the new qualifications.</P>
    <P>We must give serious consideration to this. Perhaps our recognised qualifications need to be changed or revamped. What will happen to the 300,000 students who have received these qualifications? Are their qualifications of a greater or lower standard than the new qualifications? I would not presume to think that the new qualifications will be of a lower standard. However, graduates attending for interview will be asked serious questions by prospective employers.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 15 which deals with validation. However, it is vitally important that it be made clear whether a course is validated prior to its commencement. There have been instances where students have taken up courses only to be informed halfway through first year that they were not recognised courses. Will validation be withdrawn in the middle of an academic year? What will happen to people who commence certificate or diploma courses on 1 September or 1 October only to discover that recognition has been withdrawn? Will such situations arise?</P>
    <P>It is crucially important to ensure that students are fully informed about the courses they take up. If there are questions about the validity or stan<Col N="815" /> dard of a qualification, students have a democratic right to know what is happening. What usually happens is that the governing body or head of faculty deals with the Department or the qualifications authority while students are beavering away in the libraries or laboratories. When the end of the year arrives, however, those students discover, a number of weeks prior to their examinations, that they will not gain recognition for their work. We must ensure that students are fully informed and that courses which are valid on the first day of term retain that validation until the end of the academic year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with the protection of learners. This section will ensure that students retain their rights, particularly in relation to private colleges. Sadly, however, it is not only these colleges which cause problems. I wish to familiarise the Minister of State with a problem I recently encountered. He may not be <i>au fait</i> with the green certificate but I am sure a number of his constituents continue to work in the agriculture sector and have not yet sold their land. A number of students commenced a two year course last September but they were told that, because the green certificate course they would normally pursue had been completed for that year, if they completed six months of the course in question they would build up their modules and be entitled to receive a green cert.</P>
    <P>The fathers of two of the students to whom I refer applied to enter the farm retirement scheme. They sold off their cattle, etc., on 1 January and put what remained into their sons names. That was fine until February when the students were informed that they would obtain their green certificates if they completed one further module. This continued until a number of the parents contacted me because their children had been informed that they would not receive green certificate recognition until they completed the two year course. On the day these students commenced their course they were informed that they would obtain their green certificates without having to complete the two year course.</P>
    <P>We hope that this matter will be rectified by the end of the month. However, for the past four months, the parents of the two students have lost money they could be drawing down from the farm retirement scheme because their children were misled by education officers in Teagasc. Will those learners be compensated under the provisions in section 7? I would like to see this rectified as soon as possible. Two other students who did that course needed the green certificate qualification for tax purposes. They are in the same position with the Revenue demanding money, having been misled by Teagasc. That is only one course in one county and the Minister can be certain it is not the only course that has problems.</P>
    <P>The critical issue in relation to the protection of learners is that they are offered a prompt alternative and given refunds. I ask to Minister to look into the points raised.</P>

      <P>Further and higher education have seen remarkable growth and development in the past ten to 15 years. I acknowledge what the staffs and management of various institutions have done since 1985 when I became involved in that sector.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the culmination of a debate which has been ebbing and flowing as long as I have been involved in the VEC, Dublin Institute of Technology and NCEA sector. The debate has been whether to go the UK route or to protect the binary system. We were engaged in a similar debate when discussing the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and the Regional Colleges Bill. That was a valuable debate and it is worth taking time to tease out some of the issues. The binary system in Irish higher education is probably what provides much of the dynamic for excellence for which we can be justly proud.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the decision to promote the Regional Technical Colleges, albeit from a small beginning, was a most enlightened development at the time. That the Regional Technical Colleges were housed in standard box-like buildings, dotted in regional centres throughout the country, built at low cost off a standard plan, is a separate issue. That successive Governments took the decision to promote higher education down the technological route is to the credit of people who have occupied Marlborough Street in the past. Nobody can underestimate the contribution of the Waterford institute on that region or the contribution of Athlone Regional Technical College on the pharmaceutical and plastics industry. In Dundalk Regional Technical College, Dr. McDonagh can accept a great part of the credit for the economic development in the Border counties. That institute will continue to promote the North-South economic corridor in a most unique way. The smaller recent regional technical colleges, now institutes, such as Tralee and Galway, have promoted the marine industry. Much of that research and development would not have been possible without the energy and dynamism of the regional technical college directors. I will not name them because it would be invidious to do so. Certainly their contribution to regional and economic development has been colossal.</P>
      <P>In recent years the development of the further education section has exceeded all expectations. Not long ago post-leaving certificate courses were regarded as irregular by the Department of Education and Science. When I was first associated with promoting post-leaving certificate courses, numbers were dropping in VEC schools and something had to be done to maintain numbers in what were rapidly becoming empty buildings. VEC principals throughout the country, and certainly in Dublin, worked with the curriculum development unit to devise new courses and appropriate curriculae for those students who wished to go on to further education but not aspiring to full university or regional technical college courses. That sector has a significant input into academic life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> At the risk of being biased, Ballyfermot senior college has made a significant contribution in recent years, whether through the animation school, the rock school or video production. Almost all those in the entertainment industry in Ireland, and many who are working abroad, have attended Ballyfermot senior college. Coláiste Dhulaigh, Coolock, has made, and continues to make, a major contribution to further education through journalism, video and communications generally. There are times when students in my part of the city aspire to going to Coláiste Dhulaigh before considering the DCU degree course in journalism. One of the newer colleges, such as the Tallaght Regional Technical College, is carving out its own important niche in that area. I have no doubt Blanchardstown Regional Technical College will go down the same route.</P>
    <P>The decision by previous Governments to put a structure on the whole plc further education sector through the setting up of the NCEA was a most enlightened one. It addresses some of the concerns Deputies are articulating about quality assurance and standards. I have no doubt the rigorous standards applied to the monitoring of courses in the NCEA sector will stand the test of time. This Bill copperfastens the approach to quality assurance.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of serving for a term on the NCEA, during which time I saw the approach taken in regard to the validation of courses. Undoubtedly there was often a push to have courses approved and ratified towards the end of one academic year for the next. The academic assessment carried out by experienced external evaluators ensured that in all but the most rare cases was anything but the highest standard applied.</P>
    <P>Deputies have expressed concern about NCEA qualifications and the 300,000 who attend those courses. While serving on the NCEA I took part in that debate and we had some concerns. I am satisfied that the mechanisms proposed in the Bill will address that issue. Dublin Institute of Technology has a long standing partnership arrangement with Trinity College and some of the degree courses have always been validated by Trinity College. That partnership arrangement has worked extremely well. From time to time people seeking jobs abroad have said they graduated from Dublin Institute of Technology. If they came from the school of architecture they always insisted they came from Dublin Institute of Technology. If you were putting forward your engineering qualification you said you qualified from Trinity College.</P>
    <P>The initiatives in the Bill to recognise experiential learning are worthwhile. There are people in all our constituencies who are getting their first opportunity to return to education having left the formal education system early with no qualifications. Through the home-school liaison scheme, early start or whatever, they are attracted back <Col N="818" /> into the education system. In year one 100 places were made available on VTOS courses. Through the development and expansion of these courses there are, according to a recent supplement in <i>The Irish Times</i>, 35,000 people pursuing these courses. The scheme was in operation for three or four years before any recognition could be given to VTOS students going to university. The tiny number allowed through that mechanism in years one, two and three reinforced the confidence of some people to say it is possible for people to pursue a course of sufficient academic standard to allow them progress to university.</P>
    <P>All Members probably know people who started on VTOS courses, went on to universities and are now teaching or lecturing at post-primary level. I know a number of such people and we owe it to them to ensure that a structure is put in place. The overarching structure proposed in the Bill is probably the best model. It has been suggested by various Ministers in recent years as the best way forward and the best way to underpin opportunities to move up the system.</P>
    <P>The fears of the university sector are unjustified. It will always be the main provider of academic third level education. Regardless of how the institutes of technology evolve and develop, they will provide a complementary structure and delivery system. This is all the more healthy for the sector.</P>
    <P>I was so long associated with the Dublin Institute of Technology that I cannot avoid mentioning its contribution to third level education. The approach to apprenticeship education has been underpinned by the commitment, enthusiasm and enlightenment of successive people in the constituent colleges of the Dublin Institute of Technology. I always had a fear that if the Dublin Institute of Technology became a university, apprenticeships might be sidelined. I worried that some of the lower level courses in some of the Dublin Institute of Technology constituent colleges might be shed. One of my last jobs before I left the governing body of the Dublin Institute of Technology was to chair a working group on the setting up a faculty structure. The staff were convinced that there was a need to retain the apprenticeship area and certificate level courses. The Bill will ensure there is a structure and a delivery mechanism in place to maintain those areas.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely enlightened Bill. It will be as good as the Vocational Education Act, 1930, which was also extremely enlightened legislation in its day. The Bill will ensure opportunities are available to anybody who wants to avail of them and to progress through the education system from entry to post-graduate level. I commend the Minister and his officials on this excellent legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his Second Stage speech, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, expressed the view that the Bill would make a major contribution to the future <Col N="819" /> development of this country. He said it was not enough just to provide resources at third level and post-leaving certificate level and that genuinely flexible and appropriate opportunities must be provided and the quality of qualifications protected. The Minister said the Bill was based on this idea and rested on the four pillars of access, transfer, progression and quality. These objectives will be commendable and worthwhile if they are achieved.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said the Dearing review in the UK pointed to the extensive damage which can be caused by a<i> laissez-faire</i>, one size fits all approach to education. The Minister singled out one of the Dearing recommendations &ndash; the protection of different levels of awards through a framework of quality control and progression between levels. I do not find fault with these aims, but I wish to make some observations about the Bill where it appears it does not measure up to these lofty aspirations.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to put in place a legislative framework which will, according to section 4, promote and maintain procedures for access, transfer and progression. I presume the term &ldquo;access&rdquo; incorporates equality of access. Many factors inhibit equality of access to education and they are, in the main, socio-economic. However, there are also geographical factors. The south-east region, which I represent, suffers from a deficit in terms of degree provision in the region. This was acknowledged in the steering committee report on the future of third level education.</P>
      <P>Waterford Institute of Technology urgently needs, in the short to medium term, to move to a status similar to the Dublin Institute of Technology. To ensure the Waterford institute can in the shortest possible time make good the regional deficit, it must be granted stand alone status. While it remains within the wider family of institutes of technology, it will be inhibited in terms of optimum growth. The obvious course for the Waterford Institute of Technology to follow is that taken by the Dublin Institute of Technology, leading to an application under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, to the Government seeking establishment as a university. The Dublin Institute of Technology recently underwent such a review.</P>
      <P>The case for the upgrading of Waterford Institute of Technology to university status is based on meeting a regional deficit as distinct from competing with other institutes of technology. There is a great need to develop a state of the art research and development capacity in the region. There is also the important factor that graduates tend to settle close to the college from which they graduate. The Minister said the Bill will make a major contribution to the future development of the country. Did he include all the regions, particularly the south-east region? There is not only a deficit in terms of degree provision in the south-east, but also in terms of the range of degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> The conclusions and recommendations made by the review group, chaired by Mr. Dermot Nally, on the application of the Dublin Institute of Technology for designation as a university are interesting. For example, A3 states that in taking into account the various options, the review group recommended that, as an immediate first step, funding and administrative responsibility for the Dublin Institute of Technology should be transferred from the Department of Education and Science to the Higher Education Authority which should apply to the Dublin Institute of Technology the same controls as it applies to institutions at present under its aegis. This is the kernel issue in relation to Waterford Institute of Technology and the regional deficit.</P>
    <P>I was the Labour Party education spokesman when the Regional Technical College and Dublin Institute of Technology Bills went through the House in 1992. The Bills were dealt with by the three relevant Ministers at the time &ndash; Deputy O'Rourke, Deputy Davern and Deputy Séamus Brennan. The Dublin Institute of Technology has managed to progress to its current position, where it is in the process of becoming a university, because it was granted stand alone status outside the regional technical colleges sector at that time.</P>
    <P>If one considers the five cities in Ireland, Waterford is the only one which does not have a university. The other four also have institutes of technology, which is fine. I am not making this case because of envy and begrudgery, but strictly in terms of regional deficit and need. There are four universities in the Dublin region, including NUI Maynooth, with another due to come onstream. Universities are not evenly spread throughout the country and this must be put right. The only way that will be achieved is if the Minister provides for another tier in this Bill so that colleges can stand alone outside the group of institutes of technology. While a college remains in that group it shares in the overall funding, so by definition its progress will be inhibited.</P>
    <P>The other relevant recommendation is the fourth, which is that the institute should continue to develop and enhance its existing strong sub-degree and apprenticeship provision, and that the Dublin Institute of Technology charter shall appropriately reflect institutional commitment to the preservation and development of the multi-level nature of the institute. It is also recommended that the Higher Education Authority should ensure, through budgetary and other measures, that the full integrity and development of the craft and technician sector within the institute is maintained and, if necessary, legislation should be enacted to ensure this happens. This issue is pertinent to Waterford IT and other ITs which, in the fullness of time, will want to follow this path. The sub-degree qualifications should not alone continue but should be developed and enhanced because both parts of third level provision are important. As I have said on many occasions, the education success story <Col N="821" /> since the early 1970s has been the regional technical college sector, now the IT sector.</P>
    <P>As we enter the new millennium it is beyond belief that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and the Fianna Fáil-PD Government continue to treat in such a blatantly dismissive way the aspirations of Waterford and the south-east region to have a university. The Minister's refusal to remove the word &ldquo;primary&rdquo; from the second recommendation of the interim review group's report on the delegation of qualification awarding authority to Waterford IT is a matter of grave concern. The group's final recommendations for Waterford IT and Cork IT on the matter of delegating qualification awarding authority are identical except for the word &ldquo;primary&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;primary degree&rdquo;. The recommendation for Waterford IT reads:</P>
    <P>After an appropriate period of time following the delegation of qualification awarding authority in respect of certificate and diploma courses, a review shall take place which would have the potential to grant delegation in respect of primary degree courses.</P>
    <P>The recommendation for Cork IT merely states &ldquo;degree courses&rdquo;. I raised this matter with the Minister on a number of occasions by way of Dáil question and he stated that the appearance of &ldquo;primary&rdquo; before &ldquo;degree&rdquo; in the recommendation for Waterford IT and its non-appearance in the recommendation for Cork IT is of no significance. However, the NCEA guide to the various qualifications which it validates makes a clear distinction between primary degrees, on one hand, and graduate diplomas and masters degrees, on the other. Even the pages dealing with those two groups of degrees are of a different colour.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister suggesting a prestigious body like the interim review group, chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly, could have made a mistake such as this? It is astounding that such a suggestion could be made. This issue must be dealt with once and for all. Either the Minister is saying a prestigious body was in dereliction of its duty by making a basic mistake in one of its recommendations, or he is not. There is a vast difference between primary degrees, on one hand, and graduate diplomas and masters degrees, on the other.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister and the Government to state that the recommendation for Waterford IT will be amended to delete the word &ldquo;primary&rdquo;. The Minister said he could not ask an independent body to change its recommendations. Perhaps a basic mistake was made, perhaps not &ndash; there may be a reason for using the word &ndash; but let the Minister tell us why rather than saying it is of no significance. Leading academics do not make mistakes like this in important reports.</P>
    <P>I am fed up receiving silly answers from the Minister on this issue, he must clear it up. It is not good enough that under the Donnelly recommendations Waterford IT will receive less power than Cork IT, particularly when Cork already has <Col N="822" /> a prestigious university. I want the truth on this matter. Let the Minister tell the House once and for all what the position is.</P>
    <P>I have made efforts to get a commitment from the Minister for Education and Science to make it a major element of the national plan for 2000-6 to upgrade Waterford IT to university status, and to fund this move properly. This is the only effective means of combating the regional deficit in the number of students taking degree courses. My efforts have received no direct response and this raises my concern. I have no doubt the upgrading of Waterford IT to university status through substantial funding from the national development plan is the most important element in ensuring the optimum economic and industrial development of the south-east region in the new millennium.</P>
    <P>In response to another Dáil question, the Minister mentioned the distinctive and unique mission of Waterford IT in the south-east, in that through the breadth and quality of its activities, unmatched by any other institute in the region, it has achieved a position of considerable standing. This is nothing more than waffle and is an insult to my constituents in terms of achieving real and substantial progress in the short to medium term towards the establishment of a university. If the Fianna Fáil-PD Government is to turn its back on Waterford and do nothing to tackle the educational deficit in the south-east, let it have the courage and fortitude to say so. I will not accept evasive nonsense and continual denials that there is a substantial difference between the recommendations for these two institutions in the Donnelly report. I will not accept that dismissive, insulting behaviour on behalf of my constituents and the region I represent. There needs to be another tier that allows more flexibility in terms of responding to regional deficits.</P>
    <P>Other issues need to be addressed in the context of the proposed further education and training awards council. It is disgraceful that students who may be euphemistically referred to as AQAs &ndash; any qualified applicants &ndash; and who may only have five passes in their leaving certificate are accepted on courses in the institute of technology sector. They are used as fodder to ensure there is sufficient staffing levels for the add on degrees. The Minister has a duty to ensure that students do not enter colleges with academic records which indicate they will not be able to conclude their studies.</P>
    <P>The very worrying drop out levels in the third level sector must be addressed. Many of the students concerned would be much better placed at the plc level. Their attendance at these colleges is a cynical misuse which is not in their interests. It is a matter that must be seriously addressed.</P>
    <P>The proposed further education and training awards council could address issues arising from the community employment schemes, especially with regard to those involved in the caring area, whether it be the disabled, senior citizens or whatever. Some of these people aspire to a high <Col N="823" /> standard of competence, but because there is no educational component in what they do, they have nothing to show for their efforts, even though they may have been very successful. There needs to be a qualification structure to lead them back into the formal education system so that they can make the kind of progress they might have made had their early formal education been a success. This issue needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great interest in the area of literacy. It is a subject that needs to be debated, perhaps in another context. I recently presented certificates to those, mainly mothers, who had taken part in a home-school liaison project. There was one institute of technology qualification involved. The interest of parents had been aroused through the home-school liaison programme in primary school. It was apparent that an astounding number of people are pursuing courses. There is so much potential in this area it is important that proper linkages are made between all the areas involved.</P>
    <P>I have misgivings about this Bill. For example, there may be insufficient linkages between the technological and university sectors. We will have to see how they will work. I look forward to the Minister's reply, especially to the points I raised about the Waterford Institute of Technology.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is excellent legislation involving forward thinking. It is another ambitious project by the Minister. I especially welcome the consultation that took place in the preparation of the Bill. The Minister is to be commended for that.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the trouble the Minister took to establish a forum to develop a national qualifications framework. The partners in education had the opportunity to have their proposals fully considered. As a result I believe the Bill is widely welcomed and, while some of my colleagues in the House have misgivings, it has been generally regarded as a great success and it will contribute to a major development of the education sector. There has also been general agreement across the education sector that a national framework of qualifications is needed, indeed has been needed for some time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the aims of the Bill. These include the establishment and development of standards of knowledge, skill and competence, the promotion of quality further education and training, the provision of a system of co-ordinating and comparing education and training awards and the promotion and maintenance of procedures for access, transfer and progression. These are major aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I especially welcome the approach taken by the Minister to the preparation of the Bill. He has approached it from the point of view of learners, including the need to protect students and their interests with a view to seeing how the education sector can help learners and help to progress <Col N="824" /> students' careers. It is generally recognised that there is no authority or body with overall responsibility to ensure that students' needs are met. The Bill will ensure that learners will be able to see all the options available to them before selecting a course in a college or university. Given that many students on entering college or university may not be sure about how their careers will progress, it is important for them to be able to consider their options. I agree with the Minister when he said this can only be achieved by having a coherent national basis for co-ordinating and comparing all education and training awards and also by ensuring that appropriate standards of knowledge, skill and competence are set and that mechanisms are put in place to ensure they are met.</P>
    <P>The proposal to establish a national qualifications authority is to be welcomed, as are its aims to maintain a framework of qualifications, to act as the overall guarantor of the quality of further and higher education training awards other than in the existing universities, and to facilitate and promote access, transfer and progression into and within education and training. This is important because when people attend college they like to think they will get the credits to which they are entitled. In addition, the many students who travel abroad are concerned that the qualifications they obtain in this country are recognised elsewhere.</P>
    <P>When colleges get into difficulty it always appears that the students suffer, whether it is the loss of fees or the inability to complete a course in a college of their choice. That is regrettable. Under section 43, the Minister has made a provision that a reserve fund or insurance cover must be in place by institutions when they provide courses. I welcome that. It will give comfort to many students, especially to those who have been badly burnt. That is why I welcome incorporation of the charter for the protection of students in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill will establish two new awarding bodies, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council with the aim that they will provide certification for all education and training in the State other than those in primary and post-primary education, universities and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to my colleague, Deputy Naughten, when he mentioned that the links between universities are not sufficient. We must recognise that the universities will have a nominee on the National Qualifications Authority and they will also be advised by the authority on the implementation of access, transfer and progression arrangements. That will be of great benefit to students in the future and it will also maintain the independence and autonomy that exists currently among the universities.</P>
    <P>Learners can approach this and all future courses with a great deal of confidence knowing that their needs are being considered. There <Col N="825" /> should be greater co-ordination between the courses available in many third level institutions and the jobs available in industry. For too long a number of courses, particularly in colleges in the west, have not provided real opportunities for young people from my part of the country to get jobs in their local areas. I come from a part of the country where a large number of multinational industries are operating successfully. However, the Castlebar-Galway Institute of Technology does not have the appropriate courses that would qualify students to fill jobs in the region in which they are studying. I hope that gap will be bridged in the years ahead. Industry has a major role to play in this regard. The Minister said he recognises that and is trying to develop a partnership approach between industry and third level education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. Progression, quality and the making of awards are very important to the future of our education process. The developing of international links and of links with industry is something that must be commended. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Bill. We all recognise its importance and timely introduction. If it is successful in introducing a comprehensive and cohesive system of certification and an awards system at third level, it will be most welcome. I hope it achieves its goal, but its aspirations are too vague.</P>
      <P>I see nothing in the Bill that supports its aspiration to establish and develop standards of knowledge, skills and competence. Its objective to promote the quality of further education and training and higher education and training is welcome at this juncture. There is a great need to revamp further education and training and higher education and training. There has been a dip in the quality of higher education other than university education. The universities seem to be a law unto themselves and untouchable, but the Bill does not address the problems in that sector. One of its objectives is to promote and maintain procedures for access, transfer and progression. If the Minister believes this Bill will ensure there will be access to or transfer from one sector of education to another, he will be disappointed. We might as well be hitting our heads off a brick wall. The Minister will not be able to move the university authorities in that direction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooper-Flynn welcomed the inclusion in the membership of the authority of one representative from the university sector. That sector should not be entitled to a representative on the authority because of its resistance to openness, transparency and co-operation. That sector has an agenda. It wants to preserve its status and nobody, even the Minister of the day, is allowed encroach on it. It is regrettable that is its outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the contents of the Bill are aspirational and because of that and a number of other reasons it will be difficult to achieve much pro<Col N="826" /> gress in many of the areas I mentioned. If change is necessary &ndash; I believe it is &ndash; now is the time to make lasting and meaningful links between the providers of training, industry, commerce and business. The Bill is only aspirational in these important areas.</P>
    <P>I cannot envisage how the Bill will achieve its objectives, particularly that of developing standards of education, skill and competence. I would like the Minister to point out the sections which provide for the development of competence that would filter downstream as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill provides for co-ordinating education and training awards. It will probably succeed in this instance and that is welcome. I would like the Minister of State to comment on whether the awarding system is being co-ordinated or duplicated in this instance. As we have a large number of awarding councils, are we changing the brand name or are they being co-ordinated? I would welcome their co-ordination. The Bill will be worthwhile if it succeeds in improving access and promoting and improving the quality of education and training at this level.</P>
    <P>Membership of the new authority represents a token recognition of former bodies rather than their importance and what they can contribute. It is welcome that the Minister shall appoint two members to the authority and one person shall be nominated to it by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The appointments to the authority of the chairman of the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the chairman of the Further Education and Training Awards Council are also welcome. The universities shall nominate one person to the authority, but I question why that sector should be given such recognition. Forfás, IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions shall each nominate one person to the authority, and two people who have knowledge related to the functions of the authority shall also be nominated to it.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that there must be gender balance on the boards of all these bodies. I hope the Minister or Minister of State will lead by example and introduce gender balance in the new authority from the outset rather than leave it to the authorities or the various representatives to force the authority to include members to create the required gender balance, as happened in the past. There is blatant discrimination in regard to gender balance on boards at present.</P>
    <P>If it is not the responsibility of the Minister to introduce gender balance to the boards of these bodies, whose responsibility will it be? The Bill which provides for the establishment of the two awarding councils, other than the Dublin Institute of Technology and the universities, shies away from challenging the university structure.</P>
    <P>There is currently a large diversity of courses and certification. What is the status of many of these courses? What value have they nationally or internationally? I query the status of many of these courses and their value to those who pursue them in terms of job opportunities down the road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> We are all aware that much past industrial success was based on a well educated and well trained workforce in the regions. This was provided by the establishment of Regional Technical Colleges in many areas, such as the Regional Technical College in Waterford mentioned by Deputy O'Shea and the Galway-Mayo institute mentioned by Deputy Cooper-Flynn.</P>
    <P>I resent the fact that we have to give these institutes new names just for the sake of a label. We are losing sight of their original focus. We should not have to upgrade them to the status of a university or whatever on a regional basis for political reasons. This House should set an example and it is regrettable that we are approaching it in this manner. We should upgrade institutions which merit it and whose achievements indicate they are ready for such status. I am not sure why they want to leave their original goals, achievements and aims behind. They were originally established as colleges of technology for further education and training. They should remain as such because they were doing a fantastic job. Regrettably, many of them have lost their way.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for this. They are in terminal decline, unless they are reinitiated and given powers and resources to re-establish them as they are entitled to be. They are in decline because of management structures and particularly staffing &ndash; many staff are working on a part-time or temporary basis. How can one expect professionals to maintain morale in discharging their important duties and to continue to meet the highest standards if they have no goals and no link to the institution for which they work, even in a temporary capacity? I hope the Minister will ask the directors of every institute of technology to establish permanent posts as soon as possible and eliminate the high percentage of part-time personnel attempting to deliver quality education.</P>
    <P>The high drop-out rate in these colleges relates to these staffing problems. It is regrettable that in the past few days the TUI members in these institutes, who have been driven to the edge, said they will withhold students' examination results &ndash; and this is at a time when many students are actually sitting their examinations. How can management or staff be so callous as to make this threat when students are sitting examinations? It is a disgrace and I hope the Minister will ask directors of these institutes to clear up this problem. When staff are employed on a temporary basis they have few obligations and ties to an area. They have no incentive to give their best to the education process. I ask the Minister to rectify this problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>When Regional Technical Colleges were established they liaised with industry. However, that no longer exists. I know someone who completed a four year degree course in an institute of technology. It is a highly technological course, yet the student did not undergo any placement, despite <Col N="828" /> the fact that there was a manufacturing industry directly related to the course within a stone's throw of the institute. There was no communication. I do not know whether this was the fault of the institution, the teachers or the industry. The institute directly provides a high percentage of the workforce of the industry at all levels &ndash; manual, management and technical. As I said,these links were established in the past but are now gone. We must ask whose fault is this. A comprehensive review of these institutes is needed before any further progress is made in changing their names or upgrading them.</P>
    <P>I am not here to flog regional technical colleges which are now called institutes of technology. They have done tremendous work in a regional capacity by positively responding to the needs of their areas. For example, in Galway there are catering and hotel management courses which are second to none and have provided staff for the tourism industry in the west. The same can be said for the fishing industry in Donegal. However, there is no recognition of links between business and industry. Those links must be re-established if we are to move forward. These institutes are in decline because they have failed to keep pace with the advances in industry. This is a result of serious and endemic staffing problems which must be solved.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what can be done about present drop-out rates. While there is a high drop-out rate at second and third levels, it has increased significantly at second level. Many students believe that if they get as far as completing the technical leaving certificate they can go directly into the workplace. They have lost confidence in certificates and diplomas in many disciplines. They get out of the education system because they believe they are better off in employment at an early stage than completing a course at third level, in which they do not want to participate or to which they are unsuited, and which they will not utilise in their careers. This issue must be tackled once and for all and acted upon quickly.</P>
    <P>Parallel to the decline of these institutes, staff have left them and established private colleges and independent courses. Because they have better access to industry and greater personal links, many of these private institutes and courses are far more attractive to students than similar courses in institutes of technology. We are going to recognise many courses in this legislation. It is inconsistent that the Minister will recognise applications at third level but will not recognise an application for recognition of an independent second level school. That was recently challenged in the courts, which should not have been necessary. Will someone have to challenge in court the right for this course to be recognised? I request the Minister to undertake, as a matter of urgency, a root and branch review of the functions, administration and final end product of our third level institutions.</P>
    <P>

    <Col N="829" />
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very important legislation which provides a framework for the education and training system to grow. It allows for promotion of access, transfer between courses, progression and quality control.</P>
      <P>In many respects, the Bill effectively replaces the NCEA. I was interested to hear the Minister say that over 150,000 awards had been made by that body since it was set up in the early 1970s and set up by statute in 1979, which is 20 years ago. Perhaps more than any other development in education, the existence of the NCEA and the awards it made through the various colleges made an enormous difference to the provision of third level education in this country. The NCEA, the NCVA and FÁS were the forerunners of the two new awarding councils proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill's provisions allow it to be enabling rather than prescriptive legislation. It will facilitate the transition and continuity we all consider desirable.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact the Bill addresses the situation in private colleges. Many of our constituents have expressed reservations about this entire area. It must be said that private colleges provided places and opportunities for people who would not otherwise have got them in this country and did some excellent work. However, there were difficulties. Many people would have said that educational establishments which were set up to be commercial and profit making could not deliver the right ethos and educational standards but they were disproved in most instances. However, there were instances when the rights of students were not adequately protected.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions in this Bill for the protection of students on courses of more than three months duration if they lead to the award of certification. In such cases, the fee will be refunded and there will be an onus on the awarding council to find an alternative place for the student in question, which is even more important in some respects. Since the Bill was introduced in the Seanad, the Minister has managed to reach agreement with the private colleges and is proposing a bonding system.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned the creation of 8,000 extra places in third level education and 4,000 extra places in plc courses in the past two years. That is an extraordinary number of places in ongoing and third level education. Apart from the increase in the number of places, an amazing diversity of courses is available.</P>
      <P>That extremely encouraging development is the driving force behind our economy. However, as many speakers have said, it has been the driving force which has brought us this far but we need to ensure it continues to allow us to hold our position in the world's economic hierarchy. That is an even greater challenge than the previous challenge to get this far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is not just about providing places and courses. Third level and ongoing education must be flexible and appropriate. Quality must be protected to ensure a long-term contribution is made <Col N="830" /> to the development of the country, its economy, the social fabric and all the others aspects to which education has a contribution to make.</P>
    <P>There has been much consideration of the need for cohesive, coherent and effective systems of ongoing education for many years. The Green Paper of 1992 set out the parameters clearly and they have been followed up to now. The NESC report of 1993 went further in setting out the need for co-operation between industry and the third level sector in terms of the future jobs market. The national education convention report and the EU funded operational programme for human resources development endorsed and supported the need for an integrated certification board and for the formal involvement of industry and the social partners in the development of programmes and the assessment of quality.</P>
    <P>It must be said that all those interests had a very positive and constructive informal input into what has happened heretofore. I am glad the Minister has managed to present this Bill, the background to which was fraught with difficulties, in co-operation with all the potential partners and without the difficulties we witnessed in some of the previous legislation on third level education.</P>
    <P>The Minister held a forum a little over a year ago, after the second Teastas report. The views of all those with an interest in ongoing education were included in that forum. The underlying consensus which allowed this legislation to be brought forward without any of the traditional players kicking up a huge fuss or calling for huge changes in it emerged from that forum. Anyone involved in education will consider that quite an achievement by the Minister and the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>We must learn from the experiences of our counterparts in other countries. I know the Minister took cognisance of the findings of the Deering report in the UK, which looked very closely at all aspects of third level and ongoing education and came up with quite strong findings. There had been a <i>laissez faire</i> attitude in the UK for a number of years to courses of this kind &ndash; which has also been the case in this country, to some extent, in recent years. The report strongly recommended a framework of quality control and progression between levels. I am glad that experience and other international experience in the US, Australia and New Zealand, which are in similar situations to us in many senses, has been used in the drafting of the framework we believe we need.</P>
    <P>The framework proposed by the Minister &ndash; the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the two awarding bodies &ndash; is very comprehensive and inclusive. In its definition of persons engaged in learning, it is inclusive in a way in which third level education in Ireland was traditionally exclusive. Every Member of this House will welcome that change in approach. It has been a gradual change in some respects but it is very strongly recognised in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the term &ldquo;learner&rdquo;, which replaces words such as pupil and student, <Col N="831" /> which had certain connotations. The term &ldquo;learner&rdquo; is very inclusive and recognises the rights of learners.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the clear definition of &ldquo;education provider&rdquo; and the provision for the control of programmes and their content. A profusion of third level colleges has grown up over a relatively short number of years. Almost every speaker has been able to mention either an aspiration for one or a number of existing colleges in his or her constituency.</P>
    <P>There are some colleges in Clare also. When I was a young lad the only providers were the universities, of which University College Galway was the only one in my region. A college was then founded in Limerick in the Minister of State's constituency. Subsequently, Regional Technical Colleges were founded in Limerick and Galway. In addition, a number of institutions in Clare provide third level or post-leaving certificate courses. The Shannon College of Hotel Management, a specialist institution, aspired to and reached the highest standards of quality on a consistent basis since it was set up. The Burren College of Art, the most international third level institute in this country, although it is not well known outside County Clare, is an establishment which adheres to the highest standards of quality. Many plc courses have provided people with suitable qualifications and skills to avail of employment opportunities, often to a greater extent than the traditional universities. In the cultural field there is Buíon Cheoil an Chláir in Ennis, which works at all levels. It deserves a higher level of support and recognition.</P>
    <P>A resource which would be easy to tap is that of married women working in the home. They may have experience of other work before they became homemakers. They are among the most flexible, imaginative and durable workers, possessors of great common sense and judgment. They have built up a huge complement of skills over the years, the potential of which we have been slow to recognise. They could provide the workforce which many of the companies prepared to locate here would be delighted to have. It is a huge shortcoming in all our attempts to improve education and workforce provision that no coherent attempt has been made to tap that resource. It has the potential to transform the industrial workforce across a huge range of locations and skills. These women could make us less dependent on those three or four industries on which we depend too much according to the report published yesterday.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State deals with adult and continuing education. I compliment him for his work in that area and the level of co-operation he has achieved between bodies which worked hard heretofore but did not work together.</P>
    <P>There are specific matters to be addressed by the awarding bodies at the start of courses &ndash; for example, access. In the Limerick institute there is <Col N="832" /> a course in computer studies for which second level students can sit an examination. Because of the workload involved, the college is unable to facilitate all the students in the catchment area who are undertaking the course. Students in one college doing exactly the same as students in a neighbouring college cannot have their attainments considered when applying for a place on the course in the college, and there are other examples, such as that mentioned by Deputy Naughten. The authorities need to have a role not just in the type of qualification awarded, but in the transfer from second level.</P>
    <P>One of the developments which the involvement of NCEA facilitated was a greater recognition of the strength of the institute system within third level by the universities. When I was on the board of Limerick Regional Technical College a very strong course there was accredited by Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh. There was no reason whatsoever one of the Irish universities could not be the facilitating body which enabled Limerick Regional Technical College to provide the course. It was one of the courses which contributed most to the development of the infrastructure in that region and throughout the State. There was a sense in which the universities considered themselves above the poor relation which emerged from the VEC system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill provides a forum for a consensus to emerge which will spread control and access so people can benefit from third level education in a meaningful way which will enhance their opportunities to be a useful member of the workforce and the community. It puts continuing education on a strong legislative footing and provides a framework which enables the consensus nurtured by the Minister to grow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Killeen on his contribution. I agree with his comments on the universities, the regional technical colleges and the vocational system. There were always those who looked down their noses at people who attended the technical schools or regional technical colleges.</P>
      <P>I would not refer to the Christian Brothers as Christian. I was taught by a Christian Brother who was anything but Christian. We learned everything through the medium of Irish. That is why I disliked Irish. Even when we played football, if a team member spoke English, a penalty was awarded to the opposing team. He would then get the leather when he went back to class. This brother was a Gaeilgeoir and that is probably why I do not like Gaeilgeoirí. At that time it was pushed down our throats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were some people with whom he was very Christian, such as the upper class children of the town. He would kiss them and put his arms around them but he had no time for people from the working class. I went through that system and I am glad to see it has changed. Most teachers are now lay people. There were some good Christian <Col N="833" /> Brothers but I was unlucky. I did not have them in first, second or third class. I got all the savages who did not do much for the education system &ndash; they probably turned many people off the system.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which will establish a national qualifications authority. I am disappointed, however, that no one from FÁS or Teagasc has been appointed to the board. These are the people who should be on the board. They meet people daily and they know the demands of the employers, the training requirements for the future and the industries which will be coming to each area.</P>
    <P>The cost of education is an enormous problem. People talk about free education; there is no such thing at any level. When people, particularly those on low income, send their children to a regional technical college or university the big issue is that the grant does not cover the costs of accommodation and food of these young people when they are away from home. This puts great stress on families. I hope before the year is out, particularly as the new school term begins in September, that the guidelines will be reviewed and the grant increased to assist people on low incomes who are finding things difficult.</P>
    <P>The cost of education is increasing and it will increase further. In the future the situation in education will be a little like the present housing problem. The rich will be able to send their children to Clongowes Wood but the poor will send them to primary school, and secondary school if they are lucky. They will not be able to afford to send them to the regional technical colleges or universities if they are lucky enough to qualify. I want this looked at immediately because people are finding it difficult to educate their children.</P>
    <P>When I entered the Dáil in 1994 there were two big issues in my county &ndash; the hospital and the regional technical college in Castlebar. I am delighted that the regional technical college is up and running and going well. Over the past number of years many thousands of children have been educated there, many of whom come from my county.</P>
    <P>It is sad on a Sunday evening to see Bus Éireann and many private contractors transporting our children from the county to third level institutions in Limerick, Galway and Letterkenny. It is sad that these people must travel so far to be educated. Galway is not too far from Mayo but if they must go to these other places, it is a major drain on the local economy and it is sad for parents to see their children having to go away. Having said that, it is great to see them getting an education. In the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s there was no system in place to assist people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill will try to deal with the people who have left the school system at an early stage, that these people will be trained or retrained and certified for that training. We are promoting too many people for the universities. People have gone through the university system and attained degrees who have never worked a <Col N="834" /> day because they are educated in an area with which they are not happy. These people are forced by their families to acquire qualifications they do not want. Many thousands such people would have liked to have gone to the regional technical colleges to be trained as carpenters, plumbers, plasterers or tradesmen of all sorts. There is a major shortage of such skilled people but Governments over the years have not been promoting this. Most Governments and those involved in the education system have tried to ensure that we send our young people on university degree courses. The taxpayers provided that education but many of these people had to emigrate to get work and make a living. We lost out to other countries because we were not able to employ them here. We should have held on to them as there is now a shortage of labour in the workplace. Many companies are complaining that the State has not ensured that we have people with the necessary qualifications to take up jobs in their industries. That is a serious situation. It is time we trained people for the work which is available. It is time we stopped wanting to send too many people to the universities and providing too many people in one profession and not enough in another. It is time the Minister for Education and Science sat down with these agencies and  worked out a system. If there is a shortage of skills in a sector, that should be dealt with. In the past all we wanted to do was provide people with an education and forget about what happened to them after that.</P>
    <P>It is great to see the Regional Technical College in Castlebar up and running. As a person who stood in that by-election, I probably will always be remembered for getting the regional technical college and the hospital for Castlebar because they probably would not have been provided but for the by-election. I was delighted to be able to do that. I was disappointed they did not call it after me but they might do that at a later stage and maybe the Minister will open it.</P>

    <P>I welcome the Bill. I would hope to see an improvement in the standard in the regional technical colleges and that we will get the recognition <Col N="835" /> for the people who go through that system. I will be glad if the board can do that and I hope it will.</P>
    <P>We have not heard much from the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, since he went into the Department. In fact, he was the best spokesman in Opposition. Like all his colleagues, he was great in Opposition. He was the best spokesman I ever came across but since he went into the Department he has been the quietest Minister. We expect a little more of him because he was all action when he was on the back benches. We want to see action on the front benches. Like Manchester United tonight, we want to see results from him. All we had in the past was talk. We now want action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>That message was delivered loudly and clearly. I thank Deputy Ring for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity which the Bill represents for a discussion on education but that is as far as I will go in relation to the Bill. If it is to succeed, its theme should be education for all and it must change access to education for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. That is what it is all about.</P>
      <P>Nobody denies that it is an excellent system for the young people who can avail of it, that is, primary school, secondary school and all elements of third level. The regional colleges are doing excellent work, as are the universities and the Dublin Institute of Technology at Bolton Street and Kevin Street. These are marvellous institutions which are turning out extremely well qualified young people.</P>
      <P>Taking that as the picture, we are forgetting thousands. The figures were published recently. Last year over 3,000 young people dropped out of the system. Therefore, there is something radically wrong and we must address that issue. Everything else is irrelevant. The people who are going through the system are doing fine. They are the pride and joy of our country. They can pick up jobs here or aboard, but the Bill will do nothing for the young people who are dropping out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the figures published in yesterday's national newspapers are alarming in that people believe emigration is a thing of the past whereas it is not. Last year 30,000 young people left this country. I accept that a number of them went of their own free will to further their education and to see the world, which is marvellous. However, 90 per cent of them &ndash; I would say 27,000 young people &ndash; left this country out of total frustration. What are they doing? The report published in yesterday's national newspapers stated that they are taking dead end jobs in New York, London, Birmingham or Manchester. Why are they doing that when there are jobs here? If you look around the city, you will see advertisements in windows for part-time or full-time jobs for young people. They are not taking those jobs <Col N="836" /> for a number of reasons. They feel that they have let themselves and their families down and that they should have done better. Their friends have got better jobs and they simply do not want to work in the same town or city as them so they go abroad on the pretext that they will do better.</P>
    <P>Young people will drop out of school for various reasons. This has been brought to my notice on more than one occasion and it has been addressed by a number of speakers here. Sometimes the family set up may not be great from the point of view of providing encouragement. We must encourage our young people to stay at school and when they get going it is easier on them. Perhaps the social background is lacking and they do not receive encouragement. The fact that a young person wants to work is something a family can be proud of. I have met numerous young people who, having left national school, have gone on to work in hotels, bars and restaurants, on farms and in the construction industry. I know a farmer who hired a young man who did not come from a farming background. It is a substantial dairy farm and the farmer said he could not have got a better worker from the agricultural colleges. The young man was given responsibility for the entire milking operation of a 30 cow herd but he cannot get any recognition for his ability. The farmer should be in a position, after 12 months or two years, to issue some form of certification to the young man. If the young man leaves the farmer's employ, he will be nothing more than a labourer even though he has the ability to take charge of a dairy herd. Had he trained at an agricultural college he would have a certificate or diploma to show for his efforts. However, because he did not want to further his education, he is at a dead end.</P>
    <P>I also want to point to the example of an up-market restaurant in which a young girl was employed after leaving school. She started doing basic work, such as waitressing, and then progressed to other duties. She turned out to be a first class waitress. The proprietor told me that he could not have expected to get a better person from the catering colleges. The girl was interested in the work she was doing but the restaurant did not have any means of recognising her ability.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the construction industry where young people learn skills, such as block-laying and carpentry, but they do not receive any certification for those skills. There is a shortfall between the issuance of certification and practical work experience. We should seek to combine the two in order to grant recognition of young people's skills. I am not saying we should open the floodgates. Some young people leave school and do not want to work but those who do should be given the encouragement of some form of recognition.</P>
    <P>The multinationals which do such excellent work in this country and create massive employment, particularly in the computer industry, canvass young people from our regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology col<Col N="837" /> leges, such as Bolton Street and Kevin Street, as soon as they receive their diplomas, or shortly beforehand. Given the money which is on offer, young people take up the jobs. Had they stayed at college, they could probably have progressed from diploma to degree stage. These young people gain practical experience in the multinationals and there should be some system whereby companies such as Intel, Hewlett-Packard and others would be linked into colleges such as Kevin Street and Bolton Street. In that way, a young person's progress could be monitored and their practical work recognised. One can have all the theory in the world but young people should be issued with certification to show they have practical experience in a particular field. That certification should be recognised as a standard of qualification. There is no such system in this country at the moment. I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>FÁS training courses, of which I have personal knowledge, are excellent. When one of my sons incurred a serious injury, he decided to complete a FÁS course in Finglas. I could not believe the standard of qualification he attained in a year. People are not fully aware of these courses. FÁS courses could be linked into a system which would allow young people to be certified for skills in the catering, farming or construction industry. In that way, more young people could be encouraged to further their education. There comes a time in a young person's life when he or she wants to get away from education and earn money. However, when people want to return to education, they should be able to take up where they left off.</P>
    <P>The current education system is excellent for those who can participate in it but there is a major deficit for some young people. Deputies O'Shea, Ring and others spoke about the need for universities in their own areas. Cavan College of Further Studies is probably one of the finest computer training institutions in the country. I would like to see a proper building being provided for it. I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would support me.</P>

      <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill. Both the Minister and the Minister of State are trying valiantly to solve a serious problem in our education system. Education is one of the main areas of development in this country. However, I fear this Bill will add a further layer of bureaucracy to the education system. In my experience, the Department is already weighed down under bureaucracy. Various boards, such as the Higher Education Authority, have been established in recent years. My experience is that people who want to return to education to com<Col N="838" /> plete post-graduate courses find the layers of bureaucracy in the system increasingly frustrating. I hope this legislation will act as an incentive rather than a barrier to resolving problems in this area.</P>
      <P>Educational disadvantage is one of the most difficult problems in our society at present. We must find ways to address the problem of people dropping out of education. If I ever have the opportunity to be in Government or to serve as a Minister for Finance or Taoiseach, I would prioritise primary education. If we could entice young people to stay in primary education, we could encourage them to proceed to second and third levels. Primary education must receive priority funding over second and third level education.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring spoke about people who could not afford to go to Clongowes and other schools of that ilk which play a major role in education in our society. I would not like to give the impression we were unhappy with the role of private education. Everybody should be entitled to it but, realistically, that is not always the case. Those schools have played a major role in the education of many people in the State.</P>
      <P>All political parties have to take responsibility for the establishment of the regional technical college in Castlebar. That college was established for political, not educational, reasons. There are excellent institutes of technology in Letterkenny, Sligo and Galway, but the establishment of the Regional Technical College in Castlebar probably affected the development of those colleges. We should have as many colleges as possible providing different forms of education for our young people, but it is not necessary to have a third level college in every county. It is more important to have third level colleges in regional areas which provide excellent educational opportunities for their students. Politicians must be courageous enough to say we cannot have third level colleges in every county because we must provide worthwhile educational facilities.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea called for the upgrading of Waterford Institute of Technology to university standard. Last week I had the privilege of being brought on a tour of the institute of technology in Sligo and was amazed by the developments that have taken place there and the work done by the teachers, lecturers and the board in general. It would be of major benefit to the Sligo region if the Government decided to upgrade the Sligo Institute of Technology to university status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certification is extremely important but, as other speakers stated, the academic educational sector has played a major role in the development of our economy over recent years, but we have come full circle in that there are vacancies in the trades. Deputy Boylan was correct in that FÁS, the Department of Education and Science and educational institutions can play a major role in developing and co-ordinating the training of people who want to pursue a trade. That is important in terms of development. The vocational education sector has played an excel<Col N="839" /> lent role in that regard. It has to compete with secondary schools on an academic level, which it has done successfully, but it may have lost the interests of vocational training. The Minister for Education and Science must examine that issue because it is a niche market. People find it very difficult to get an electrician, carpenter or plumber because we are not training sufficient numbers in those trades. That was not the case ten or 15 years ago and most of those people had to emigrate. We now have a buoyant economy but we have to import those skills which is an amazing turnaround for this country.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of opportunity in the Bill which is not just another layer of bureaucracy. I hope it meets its objectives and that it will be an incentive to the students who will participate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and on problems in the education system. It is important to move forward and the Bill is progressive in that it examines the long-term needs of the education system. The proposals in the Bill are sound but, as previous speakers have said, many problems remain in the education structure. In the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency and my own, the lack of a third level college has major implications. It means that our students have to travel long distances daily or, in the majority of cases, stay in Dublin, Sligo, Athlone, Limerick or Northern Ireland during the week. That is a real problem and I ask the Minister of State to examine ways of addressing it.</P>
      <P>Despite all the committees we have set up to debate this problem, Cavan-Monaghan is one of the areas with the highest number of people not receiving third level education. The county has many industries such as furniture, poultry and the meat industry generally. We need some education system that will ensure those industries have the necessary skilled people available to them in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's opening statement in which he emphasised the need for links between education and industry. The building industry is experiencing enormous difficulty in employing skilled personnel. Part of the reason for that difficulty is that some years ago many major business people opted to employ contract rather than full-time PAYE workers. Those contract workers, be they in the building industry, the meat sector or wherever, were interested only in ensuring they got the job done for the cheapest price but with the highest return to themselves. That was fine in the short term because the industry became more competitive, but it had major implications in the long-term. I recently visited a factory in my own county which had a sizeable floor space available <Col N="840" /> but it was not in a position to employ the skilled people needed to develop the factory. The Minister's point on links between the building industry and education is important and whatever bodies are set up must examine that question.</P>
    <P>It is nice to see people obtaining proper educational qualifications but it is unacceptable when people who have completed six years in education have difficulty getting a job, with industry unable to fill those jobs. It is difficult to believe that at a time when there is still a sizeable level of unemployment we do not have the educational needs to address this problem.</P>
    <P>There is an outdoor pursuit centre in Tanagh, near Cootehill. Over many years, and two different Governments, the VEC was advised it would get the necessary funds to operate the centre on a permanent basis. At a time when we are trying to work towards peace in Northern Ireland, and in a Border county, the lack of progress in that area is depressing. I take this opportunity to urge the Minister and his Department to examine that area. Many delegations have met Ministers over the years on this issue and it is time for the problem affecting that outdoor pursuit centre to be resolved as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the issue of disadvantage. Deputy Reynolds described this as one of the more serious areas which leads to young people dropping out at primary level. The Minister promised extra people to assess children and so on and I urge him to ensure that this actually happens, not in three years but as quickly as possible. Personnel have been taken from this area and put on other duties because of legal challenges. However, we must ensure that young people are assessed as early as possible and that they receive remedial or special education so they do not drop out at primary level, resulting in them being employed in mundane jobs for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crawford for sharing his time. I welcome this important Bill which will be of benefit to all sectors of education. I wish to raise one important issue which may stretch the remit of the Bill a little, namely, the unfair treatment of many primary school teachers who have not had the opportunity to qualify as primary teachers but who have given a lifetime of service to teaching. This debate on the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill provides an opportunity to raise this matter.</P>
      <P>Many of these people have given a lifetime of service to teaching, to pupils and to schools. A small number of people are involved and the Department should organise the education and training of these teachers. A course should be provided to enable them to receive a training which would be recognised by the Department so that they will be able to qualify as teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1974, the then Minister for Education, Mr. Richard Burke, introduced a scheme involving a large number of part-time teachers. Many people who qualified under this scheme are dedicated <Col N="841" /> teachers today. However, because of the cut-off point in the scheme, a small number of people did not qualify &ndash; some missed out by a matter of days. I know some of these people who are still working, and some are near retiring age. These people do not qualify for holiday or sick pay or for a pension and rightly feel hard done by.</P>
    <P>An official in the Department has met this group on a number of occasions and has gone out of his way to be helpful. However, no matter how much goodwill this official may have, a ministerial order will be needed to provide this course so that these people can be fully trained. This issue needs much effort on the part of the Minister of State and I ask him to bring it to the attention of the Minister. I thank the Minister of State for his interest in education. These teachers have the full backing of the INTO which is happy to co-operate with whatever course or training is provided.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, the course lasted about six months. This course could take place at weekends. These people have been working for 20 or 30 years and it is amazing that they have been retained in their posts if they are not good teachers. Perhaps this is being done on the cheap. An injustice is being perpetrated against these teachers and it should be rectified. I will raise this issue with the Minister but that is as far as I will push the issue today.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a reduction in the number of pupils studying mathematics in the leaving certificate. I am not sure of the numbers taking science but it is essential that students have a good grasp of mathematics and science when they enter third level education. If they do not have a grasp of these subjects they will find it difficult to study engineering or computer science. There may be a need to provide further incentives to encourage people to study these subjects at post-primary level. Our future depends on the skills and education people obtain in third level institutions and this can only be brought about by extending the amount of time spent studying mathematics and science.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not deal with primary education but there is a need for greater emphasis on mathematics and science at primary and post-primary level. We need to examine the methods used to teach these subjects to see if they can be improved and upgraded using modern facilities and technology, or if we can make the subjects more attractive to students. I will take an active interest in Committee Stage. I wish the Bill well. Perhaps the Minister of State will reply to the matter I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly bring Deputy Enright's remarks to the attention of the Minister and I will ask the Minister to write to him. I fully understand the point the Deputy is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to introduce the Qualifications (Education and Training) Bill to the House. As <Col N="842" /> has been evident from Deputies' contributions, much thoughtful consideration has been given to the Bill and this will form an important context for further exploration of its provisions and the various issues arising. I thank Deputies for their contributions and look forward to further discussion as the Bill proceeds.</P>
    <P>It is also evident from Deputies' comments that there is general agreement on the intent and aims of the Bill and the vital national necessity of putting in place an effective, transparent and coherent framework of qualifications which will have positive benefits for all involved in education and training, now and in the future. I look forward in particular to the debate on Committee Stage on the objects of the Bill. I listened intently to the views of Deputy Higgins on the context of the Bill and look forward to relating these to the objects of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill offers the best way forward. I readily accept that some Deputies have particular concerns and reservations and I look forward to teasing them out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Among the many interesting points Deputies made, the following are of note. Deputy Richard Bruton stressed the need for a unified structure. I hope when we discuss the Bill in detail I can outline to him the rationale underpinning the new bodies to be set up, the unifying role of the Qualifications Authority and the framework of qualifications it will develop. I also wish to outline how the framework will include all awards in the State, including awards in second level education and in existing universities. However, arrangements for the national second level examinations are set out in the Education Act, 1998, and the quality assurance arrangements for existing universities are included in the Universities Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton stressed that the key to the success of the arrangements in the Bill is how the bodies can innovate in developing ways to recognise skills. I agree with that and it is my fervent hope the new bodies will be proactive in doing that. However, the new bodies have an overall quality assurance and awarding function and will not encourage the provision of education and training as such. That is a matter for the Minister and State agencies involved in funding and encouraging providers, be they educational and training institutions, community groups or employers, to access the facilitatory awarding framework to be set up under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Similarly for access, transfer and progression, arrangements are to be set out by the Qualifications Authority and implemented by providers. It is not a matter for the authority to determine quotas which should be used for various groups accessing education and training. That is a matter for the providers, their funding authorities and ultimately the Government, as places must continue to be set aside. The key issue for the authority is that everyone is given full recognition for the knowledge, skill or competence they have attained and will attain in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> The Bill clearly sets out that the Qualifications Authority will establish and promote the maintenance of standards of the awards of the new awarding councils, the Dublin Institute of Technology and any new university which may be established. In turn, the new awarding councils must determine the standards of knowledge, skill or competence required before an award can be made. I do not understand Deputy Bruton's concerns that the Bill does not provide for these. The detail of the validation process is not set out in the Bill as it will be a matter for each of the awarding councils to determine. However, what is clear about the validation process is the definition of validation as &ldquo;the process by which an awarding body shall satisfy itself that a learner may attain knowledge, skill or competence for the purpose of an award&rdquo;. Clearly, this is a standards based approach and I look forward to discussing this more on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Regarding the difference between the validation procedures and the quality assurance procedures, the validation procedures are a matter to be determined by each awarding council and it may be necessary for an awarding council to visit a provider in the validation process. The prime responsibility for quality assurance always rests with the provider. It is not the awarding body but the provider which delivers the quality programmes and thus the provider must develop the procedures for quality assurance with the agreement of the awarding body. The awarding body must review the effectiveness of these procedures and this may involve visits to providing institutions. These are issues on which I look forward to more discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan raised the issue of the need for regular reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas and I hope sections 58, 59 and 60 on planning and reporting will address some of his concerns. He also stressed the need for flexibility in the operation of the new awarding bodies to allow the innovation under way in the institutes of technology to continue. He made a similar point about professional courses. I agree with the need not to curtail the activities of the institutes. I look forward to discussing further Deputy Deenihan's concerns and have examined the transitional arrangements set out in the Bill with a view to ensuring they are effective. There is nothing in the Bill to preclude arrangements with universities, in addition to arrangements with the awarding councils, and I encourage and support the development of relationships between the technological sector of higher education and the university sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan was anxious about the possibility of validating programmes delivered through information technology. There is no reason this will not be the case as the awarding councils are required to validate programmes if learners can meet the necessary standards and, in the case of private commercial institutions, if the necessary protections are in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> Deputy Deenihan was anxious about provision for the certification of courses leading to leisure management qualifications. I reassure him that these types of courses are included in the provisions of the Bill. He is anxious to insert a caveat to ensure a programme of further education and training run as a recreational or leisure activity for learners does not have to be submitted for validation. This is because learners may have no intent in taking such courses other than for recreation or leisure. If there is a standard of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired on such a course, it could lead to an award. The aim here is not to tie up the provider in knots through forcing them to submit every leisure and recreational programme for validation. These are different from leisure management type courses, which, if run by any of the list of State providers in the relevant sections of the Bill, would have to be submitted for validation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Michael Kitt and Perry raised important issues about the use of titles in the Bill. The Bill will effectively replace the existing National Council for Educational Awards Act. The NCEA has played an essential role in the development of certification for higher education in the State, especially in the development of the technological sector. Throughout its lifetime it has helped to ensure that the qualifications of those completing its courses are equal to those of all other graduates in the State. The NCEA has also played a key innovatory role, most recently in the way it has worked with the institutes of technology and business in developing new technician courses, especially the National Certificate in Manufacturing Technology.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards the development of an inclusive system of awards, and I consider that the Higher Education and Training Awards Council more widely reflects the activity in which it will be involved. The title of the NCEA was reflective of its time and it did not extend to making awards in the broad training sector. If the title NCEA were maintained along with the Further Education and Training Awards Council, this could lead to much confusion in Ireland and internationally. The existing awards of the NCEA are protected in the Bill. I look forward to further discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>A number of other Deputies made points which I unfortunately do not have time to respond to in detail. Deputy O'Shea mentioned the Waterford Institute of Technology, an institution I greatly admire and I will pass on his comments to the Minister. Deputy Boylan referred to the importance of certification of on-the-job experience. For the first time in the history of the State, the Bill opens the door to this possibility. It provides the opportunity for on-the-job experience to be validated as part of the award of a certificate or degree. I will pass on Deputy Enright's comments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten raised the matter of the green certificate. Section 46 requires all providers, including Teagasc, to inform learners of <Col N="845" /> the name of the awarding body and the title of the award. There are penalties in section 48 if this is not done. The situation the Deputy raised would not now happen as the title of one award would clearly not be the one they were seeking. If Deputy Naughten needs further clarification, I will arrange to correspond with him or he can raise it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Dáil Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services to people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the Programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in meeting these commitments, which include the provision of additional funding of £91.662 million and the putting in place of arrangements to meet the educational needs of children with special needs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">(Minister for Health and Children).</P>
    <P>Ms O'Sullivan: I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate. I congratulate Deputy Ahearn and her colleagues for tabling the motion, the wording of which I support. I wish to comment on the response of the Minister for Health and Children last night. The intention behind the motion is to continue the debate relating to the rights of people with disabilities, not to engage in a competition as to which Government may or may not have spent money on people with disabilities. It is unfortunate that the Minister sought to turn the debate into a competition between successive Governments because that is not what the debate should be about. This debate should concentrate on the rights of people with <Col N="847" /> disabilities and their access to the services, supports, education and training they require.</P>
    <P>I reject the concept of turning the debate into a competition between opposing Governments. We must move away from that towards a rights based approach. We must put in place services that are based on rights rather than, as in the past, continuously dragging the agenda forward. We are now in a position to fund the services that are needed. We also have access to the relevant information, databases and costings. Of equal importance, however, is that for the first time we can access funding <i>via </i>the huge surplus of money in the State's coffers. We must ensure, therefore, that the rights based approach to which I refer is put in place.</P>
    <P>The way to do this is to follow the lead of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which recommended that a rights based approach should be adopted. When it published its report at the end of 1996, the commission recommended that every person with a disability should have an assessment of needs underpinned by law which should lead to a statement of needs. It also recommended that a person with a disability, be it physical or mental, should have a copy of this statement of needs and the individual and his or her family should be able to acquire the service and supports that he or she needs. That is the approach we must take. We may be obliged to take it through the introduction of disabilities legislation. In the interim, we must use the information at our disposal to put the services and funding in place.</P>
    <P>In addition to the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, we have at our disposal information from Towards an Independent Future which provides accurate figures and estimates of funding needs in respect of social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. There is also the ongoing data and assessments of needs information relating to people with intellectual disabilities. Despite this, however, we still have a serious shortfall in funding and we must address this problem in the immediate future. In that regard I welcome the recommendation in the motion that a deadline should be set for the introduction of proposals to fully implement the recommendations of the commission.</P>
    <P>In saying there is a serious shortfall in funding in respect of people with intellectual disabilities, I will cite figures supplied by Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped in the mid-west, which is led by a doughty performer in Ger South, which indicate that it will take five years to meet the urgent needs which have already been identified for people in that region. Despite the fact that service providers, parents and people with disabilities are co-ordinating their approaches, there is still a long way to go before we have the type of seamless transfer from service to service, in accordance with needs, to which <Col N="848" /> people with disabilities are entitled and which they should be given.</P>
    <P>We need to underpin these rights in legislation. We must underpin the obligation of the strong towards the weak in society so that the State has a duty to ensure that these rights are fulfilled and that people are not obliged to constantly struggle and fight for them. It would make a huge difference if we moved to the rights based approach. I addressed a meeting in St. Michael's House a month ago which was organised by the parents' network and at which a strong commitment was made to moving towards a rights based approach.</P>
    <P>I will now to refer to the serious lack of respite care which has been identified by NAMHI, the governing body for people with intellectual disabilities. A lack of such care has also been identified in respect of people with physical and sensory disabilities. NAMHI also identified the fairly insecure basis on which personal assistants for independent living operate. This service is dependent on health boards making funding available. That is not acceptable. The Clare Centre for Independent Living held a meeting on this issue recently and highlighted that while some services have been provided there is not any indication that they will be provided in the future.</P>
    <P>The need for resource centres has been identified by the Irish Wheelchair Association. We must provide resource centres throughout the country which are accessible and appropriate to people's needs. I visited the centre in Limerick which is extremely small and which is not appropriate to the needs of the people in the area. They are anxious that a more appropriate centre should be provided. In west Limerick a very imaginative plan for a centre has been drawn up which would include the provision of sporting facilities that would be available to the entire community, not merely to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>There is a shortfall in funding for aids and appliances. Last week I received a letter from a person who is on a waiting list for a new wheelchair. The wheelchair he has is no longer appropriate to his needs but he will be obliged to wait until he reaches the top of the queue before being given a suitable replacement. People are also being obliged to wait for other appliances or to have fittings done. I am familiar with one case where a person had outgrown a fitting before adequate funding was made available to measure him for a replacement fitting.</P>
    <P>These are examples of the lack of resources which must be addressed. There is also a severe shortage of personnel in the area of occupational therapy and physiotherapy. This matter must be addressed as a matter of urgency because the people providing these services make the difference between a person having and not having an appropriate appliance or treatment. These matters must be addressed in terms of providing resources. People know what is needed, it is merely a matter of providing the necessary resources in the various health board areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> As Members are aware, changes were recently announced in the area of training which, by and large, are welcome. These involve mainstreaming the training of people with disabilities. However, there are some concerns about this, namely, that we must ensure that the appropriate support services for people with disabilities are put in place under the new arrangements. With any arrangements, concerns naturally arise and concerns were expressed to me at the launch this morning of the NAMHI guide to services. I request that consideration be given to this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to ESF funding post-1999, there is a need to ensure that the funding which, in the past, would have been targeted directly at training for people with disabilities continues to be provided. We must ensure that, if necessary, this funding should be topped-up by Government so that people with disabilities who are involved in training programmes will receive the necessary support and funding they require.</P>
    <P>These are just some of the areas I wish to highlight in respect of this debate. My main point is that all of these people should not be required to chase resources or deprive someone else of a service in respect of which they have an equal need. We must ensure that such services are available as of right and that the funding follows needs, rather than, as is currently the case, people being constantly obliged to lobby and prevail upon Ministers and Governments to ensure that they obtain what is required. The requisite funding is available from the Exchequer and we should use it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>We live in times of great change for people with disabilities. This change is aimed at bringing people with disabilities in from the margins of society and bringing about a situation which will enable them to live their lives to their fullest potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government on assuming office in 1997 committed itself to placing disability on the agenda of every Government Department and body. The measures taken by Government in the intervening period serve to highlight the advances made in this regard. Following the Government's acceptance of the establishment group report last summer, it announced the establishment of the National Disability Authority on a statutory basis and an interim authority was appointed. The National Disability Authority will be the cornerstone of a new approach to service provision for people with disabilities. The new approach involves the departure from the traditional thinking which sees disability as a medical rather than a social issue. It will also involve the relocation of functions at present carried out by the National Rehabilitation Board. The National Disability Authority will provide the essential overview of the new arrangements. Its central focus will be to monitor the implementation of standards in services provided to people with disabilities. It will function as an expert body which will assist in the <Col N="850" /> development of policy on development issues as well as the research and development of standards and codes of practice for disability services. The authority will not be a service providing agency but it will work in close co-operation with service providers in the voluntary, State and Government sectors.</P>
    <P>To assist it in implementing this agenda, the authority will commission independent research and promote innovative projects. As a dedicated body it will be a source of guidance and support to all service providers. It will assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities to people with disabilities and secure their co-operation in developing the best possible standards. The authority will offer guidance and support not only to organisations in the disability sector but also to mainstream service providers as they meet their obligations to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The National Disability Authority will report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will assist him in the development of a coherent approach to disability policy which will have direct application to all service providers. Legislation to establish the National Disability Authority is going through the Oireachtas and is expected to be enacted shortly.</P>
    <P>Vocational education and employment services for people with disabilities will be provided by FÁS, operating under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This will be a major step in the integration of people with disabilities into the labour force enabling them to achieve independence and choice. Similarly, information services currently provided by the National Rehabilitation Board will, under the new arrangements, be provided through Comhairle, a new mainstream information providing service, being established by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This development will underscore the fact that, as citizens, people with disabilities are entitled to information and entitlements in the same way as any other citizen.</P>
    <P>A number of other services, such as the audiology service provided by the National Rehabilitation Board, will continue to be available through the Department of Health and Children. These are the mainstream issues to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred. It is important that everybody recognise that in referring to mainstream issues we want to ensure people with disabilities are treated equally, have access to all services, including employment and training services and information available to the rest of society, and are not segregated and separated. Mainstreaming should always be an improvement for people with disabilities. I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan on that point.</P>
    <P>While the establishment of the National Disability Authority marks an important milestone in advancing the disability agenda, the Government has also been active in many other areas with regard to disability. On the legislation front, important advances have been made in two areas. <Col N="851" /> Last June the Employment Equality Bill was signed into law by the President. For the first time discrimination on grounds of disability in gaining access to employment and advancing in employment is outlawed. The legislation gives protection to employees in the public and private sectors as well as to applicants for employment and training. The main features of the Equal Status Bill, published on 19 April, are to prohibit discrimination on a number of grounds, including disability, and to deal with discrimination outside the employment context, including education, provision of goods and services, accommodation and disposal of property. Service is defined broadly to include access to public spaces, facilities for banking, insurance, refreshment and transport. The basic principle underlying the legislation is that people should be judged on their merits as individuals rather than by reference to the group to which they belong. The Bill passed Second Stage on Thursday last. When the anti-discrimination aspects of the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Bill are put in place, along with the institutional and service provision improvements, it will be possible to proceed in the direction of the proposed Bill dealing with disabilities.</P>
    <P>We have been working on some community action plans and community service projects on the key issues of concern to people with disabilities, especially in the information and transport areas. Funding of £45,000 has been provided to pilot community plans focusing on transport. When many people mention transport they have in mind public transport. However, as Deputy Ahearn said in the past, there is no public transport in rural areas and mini buses travel through various towns and villages. Those services need to be co-ordinated to see whether we are getting good value for money and if people are working together with the various organisations. That is what the two pilot projects are about.</P>
    <P>On the public transport side my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is involved with the transport operators. The State transport companies should provide the highest degree of accessibility. The Minister is committed to bringing about a situation where the public transport facilities will be fully accessible to all at the earliest date. The CIE companies are fully aware of the Minister's policy in this regard. There has been a positive response to this policy by the CIE companies in recent years.</P>
    <P>It has been possible to achieve a high degree of accessibility to trains and stations for customers with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs. It is now firmly established policy of Iarnród Éireann that all new trains and stations, together with major refurbishment projects at existing stations, should take account of the needs of mobility impaired customers. Recent practical examples of this policy include the new enterprise service on the Dublin-Belfast line and the <Col N="852" /> upgraded station at Kilkenny. DART trains are already accessible.</P>
    <P>The buses acquired by the two CIE bus companies in recent years have many features which make them more responsive to the requirements of people with disabilities. Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus are committed to operational trials involving large capacity low floor buses which are accessible to wheelchair users. Bus Éireann already has one such vehicle in operation in Cork city and Dublin Bus has six low floor buses in operation on the Belfield-Drumcondra route.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus is committed to increasing its quota of accessible vehicles as evidenced by the company's recent announcement that it plans to purchase a further 20 fully accessible 33 seater mini buses as part of its 1999 fleet replacement programme. Bus Éireann is also making advances in the area of accessible transport and currently has a further ten low floor vehicles on order. These vehicles are due for delivery in 1999 and will be put into service on Bus Éireann's Cork and Limerick city routes.</P>
    <P>With regard to double deck buses which have always been difficult in terms of accessibility, Dublin Bus has informed me that low floor double deck buses were not readily available for the 1999 order. However, it has commenced trials of a number of different models. Depending on the result of the pilot tests, which should be available in the autumn, Dublin Bus should be in a position to begin to order double deck buses from 2000. In addition it will undertake trials of a low articulated bus and a low floor single deck bus using LPG fuel. All three CIE companies have established user group representatives of people with disabilities. The input from these groups should give the companies valuable assistance in their ongoing programmes of improving the suitability of their services for mobility impaired customers. There is no doubt about the importance of this issue and the commitment of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
    <P>The second issue with regard to access to transport, particularly in Dublin city, is that of accessible taxis. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is committed to improving access to the taxi service for people with disabilities. Accordingly, regulations were made which empowered all local authorities to grant wheelchair accessible taxi licences. The operation and licensing of taxis and their drivers is controlled through the Road Traffic Public Service Vehicle Regulations, 1963 to 1999. Under these regulations, local authorities have responsibility for determining the number of taxi licences which may be granted and for monitoring the adequacy of the taxi service in their areas and for deciding on action to ensure the demand for these services is adequately met.</P>
    <P>In 1997 Dublin Corporation decided to issue 200 wheelchair accessible taxi licences and in 1998 it was decided to issue a further 200. The Dublin taxi forum report addressed a comprehensive set of recommendations to a range of agen<Col N="853" /> cies, including Departments, the Garda, local authorities and taxi service providers. It recommended a continuation of the policy whereby all new taxi licences issued in Dublin are wheelchair accessible and underlined the need for better marketing and organisation of taxi services. We need to focus on the organisation of taxi services in the Dublin area with regard to consumer needs. It will be principally for the taxi industry to devise specific responses to this requirement with the assistance, as necessary, of the statutory agencies and business interests.</P>
    <P>Proposals finalised in November 1998 by the joint taxi-hackney company of the four Dublin local authorities reflect in considerable measure the recommendations of the Dublin taxi forum in relation to new licences and providing for the commission of 820 additional wheelchair accessible taxis over the next three years &ndash; 350 in 1999, 235 in 2000 and a further 235 in 2001. The report of the committee was adopted by the four Dublin local authorities at their December 1998 meeting.</P>
    <P>Members raised the issue of aids and appliances. The report, Towards an Independent Future, suggested the Government needed to invest £1 million per annum in aids and appliances. Since coming into office, the Government has invested £9 million in the issue raised by the previous speaker. This amounts to nine years investment in terms of Towards an Independent Future. When will we reach the end of the waiting lists in terms of the recommendations of that report?</P>
    <P>The lack of accessible information and information in appropriate formats is a major issue among people with disabilities. The pilot schemes in operation involve people with disabilities in Ennis, Tallaght, Clondalkin, Cork and Caherciveen. The importance of these information pilot projects is that they have an outreach aspect. They involve people with disabilities in different community settings. For example, the outreach aspect of the project in Ennis embraces people with learning difficulties. The projects in Tallaght and Clondalkin involve people with mental health difficulties while the project in Cork is targeted at people with physical disabilities. In Caherciveen the isolation experienced by people with disabilities in rural settings due to lack of accessible transport is being targeted. This issue is important to Deputies from rural areas. An independent evaluation of the pilot projects will be undertaken shortly by the Department to identify issues of good practice so they can be applied in a broader sense.</P>
    <P>Another issue of importance to people with disabilities is employment and the fact that the 3 per cent quota in the public service needs to be met. This involves a commitment under Partnership 2000 that the 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service would be met during the lifetime of the agreement. This relates to the public service as distinct from the Civil Service where the 3 per cent quota has been monitored over the <Col N="854" /> years in terms of the employment of people with disabilities. The public service involves health boards and local authorities and we have established a committee representing Departments and the social partners under the chairpersonship of our committee to make progress on the attainment of that quota. This committee meets regularly and the next meeting is scheduled to take place next Monday, 31 May.</P>
    <P>Regarding the publication of the report, A Strategy for Equality, I understand that it is close to being finalised and it is my intention to place it before the Government shortly after its completion. Members also mentioned international developments. It should be a source of great pride to us that Ireland was awarded the 1998 Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Disability Award. This was accepted by President McAleese on behalf of the people of Ireland in a ceremony in New York on 5 May last. The award is presented annually to a nation which makes noteworthy national progress towards the goal of full participation of citizens with disabilities. Ireland was selected because of its progress in raising consciousness about the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities and enhancing their full acceptance in society. Those making the award took into account the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for disability and equality issues, the establishment of a council for people with disabilities which is being led by people with disabilities, the coming into law of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, the drafting of the Equal Status Bill and a proposed Disabilities Bill . Ireland's leadership in securing non-discrimination clauses in European level treaties and documents was also recognised as was the progress made on the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities such as the National Disability Authority.</P>

      <P>Yes.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty, which was voted into law by the people in May 1998, contains an important clause with regard to equality for people with disabilities. Regarding the council for people with disabilities, it is important to note that a steering group, which has been put in place, is to complete its task by 30 September 1999.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Government's commitment to the 360,000 people with disabilities in Ireland, their issues will be advanced. We are committed to empowering people with disabilities and the establishment of a representative body for people with disabilities in 1999. The efforts of the Government since July 1997 demonstrate its firm commitment to the disability sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provision of extra funding amounting to £91.662 million which the <Col N="855" /> Minister announced. There is a great need for residential places and I understand that in County Galway this year, ten extra places will be available in Tuam and Galway city. This is the largest number of places that has ever been available. Up to this year, there were only five residential places. However, I acknowledge much more needs to be done and I hope the Minister will bear this aspect in mind.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the service providers in the western region, including the Brothers of Charity, the Galway County Association for Mentally Handicapped Children and the Western Care Association. However, I do not understand why people with disabilities in certain parts of the western region are neglected and do not receive proper services. Ballinasloe town is a typical example of where there is an ongoing campaign for a respite care facility, training and education centres and residential places. It is sad that in the past people in east Galway have been told that places are available in Swinford when the region provides a health service for the midlands. This is not good enough and I hope the Minister will take this matter on board.</P>
      <P>Important services such as physiotherapy and special wheelchairs which are needed by disabled people are not available in Ballinasloe. Children with disabilities must go to Dublin for medical treatment and I understand the cost can be up to £250 a visit. I am aware of one case where a child who is autistic and has dyslexia and ADD problems must visit a specialist in Dublin perhaps five times a year at a total cost of £1,250. I am also aware of families who have been told that one of their children who has a disability or personality disorder must leave the house. This gives rise to the issue of residential places.</P>
      <P>Regarding the carers allowance for people caring for the disabled, the last budget contained improvements with regard to the means test. However, the means test for carers should be abolished. There is a level of care with regard to nursing home subventions and I hope the same will be introduced for carers. The cost of travelling to hospitals in Dublin should be treated as a deduction in the means test.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science announced extra remedial and resource teachers for primary schools. This is most welcome and it is important that there are sufficient resources and staff for the schools. Community employment schemes provided some of the staff for special education programmes through FÁS. While these are welcome, they usually only last one year. The Department should have a system in place to provide classroom assistants, occasionally on a one-to-one basis, for students with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a need to improve the school transport system for students with disabilities. I am aware of cases where students with a physical disability could get transport to their local primary school, but when he or she advanced to <Col N="856" /> second level, the families were told that the bus was not suitable for children with physical disabilities. They were told that they would receive a grant of £600, but this is inadequate and impractical. It is obviously discrimination against the students involved.</P>
    <P>Extra money is being spent, but I would like funds spent in County Galway to support special classes in primary schools, vocational schools and training centres and particularly to provide respite care facilities and residential places in Ballinasloe and the east Galway area.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue, about which all politicians can hang their heads in shame. The area has been neglected for a long time, although there may be excuses that we did not have the money. With politicians from all parties I have met parents and families of people with disabilities, and those who staff their centres, and we admitted that it was a sobering experience.</P>
      <P>Over the last eight years or so we have taken enormous strides on a range of equality issues. The Fianna Fáil-Labour Government made this a priority and did an enormous amount of good. The former Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, spearheaded this issue and did a great deal of work, as did the then Government, and he deserves many congratulations for the legislation he changed and the issues he raised, from which many good things arose.</P>
      <P>Great and positive changes are now happening in the area under discussion but much needs to be done. This issue causes great stress to the families of people with disabilities. They feel frustrated and annoyed at what happened in the past. We have made a difference and since coming to office the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, have put a lot of effort into and emphasis on this area. They are committed to putting disability on the political agenda.</P>
      <P>Establishing the National Disability Authority is a great step and it will have great influence in this area. As the Minister said, it will monitor the implementation of standards in services provided to people with disabilities and will function as an expert body which will assist in the development of policy on disability issues as well as the research and development of standards and codes of practice for disability services.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act should also have a big impact and it is important that it be implemented properly. Discrimination on grounds of disability in regard to access to employment is outlawed. The Minister mentioned that 3 per cent of those employed in the public service will be people with disabilities. This can be seen in local authorities already and they are as good as if not better than many others working there. These are positive changes but much more needs to be done. The Equal Status Bill, currently going through the Houses, is another good step in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> Those are legislative provisions but we must return to the question of funding. I welcome the provision of £91 million for this area, the Government has taken enormous strides. I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan to some extent. On this area we are all in agreement and we should move it forward together. There is consensus in the House that if we put money into this area we could make a huge impact. People have mentioned millennium projects and this could be one.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that these people should lack services. I have discussed this with my colleagues and I intend to push this issue at parliamentary party level to get proper funding for these services. Many improvements have been made and extra money has gone into a variety of services. The Minister and Minister of State have worked on various developments which will be good for the future. We should allocate the correct amount of funding to break the back of this problem once and for all so that people with disabilities and their families will be looked after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak and I thank the Minister for sharing time. In the Programme for Government and later in Partnership 2000 the Government made commitments to develop services for people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities. There is need for further investment and improvement in these services and it is important for the Government to plan the services required and to target the available funding for services of greatest demand. While there is a commitment by statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services, they are unable to plan those services because no reliable figures are available to confirm the number of people with physical and sensory disabilities. I welcome the establishment of the database development committee and understand it will be operational next year. When this information is available statutory authorities and Government agencies will then be able to make best use of resources and improve the services. This will be a positive move.</P>
      <P>Another good development was the establishment in 1992 of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. One of its recommendations was the establishment of a committee in each health board area to co-ordinate the services, drawing on the expertise of representatives of the health boards, voluntary agencies, the National Rehabilitation Board and, most importantly, disabled persons. This expertise, coupled with the information from the database development committee which will be available next year, will go a long way to improve the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each local authority should appoint a subcommittee, headed by the council chairman or vice-chairman, to deal with issues outside the health services which affect people with disabilities on a daily basis, for instance, ensuring that planning and development in each local authority area are <Col N="858" /> conscious of the needs of people with disabilities, in the public and private sectors. I recognise that, by and large, planning officers take into account the needs of people with disabilities but nonetheless such a subcommittee would create an atmosphere of active involvement to ensure that people with disabilities can be treated the same way as their fellow citizens by having services delivered to them in the same way as they are delivered to the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>Other issues such a committee could deal with include active promotion of job opportunities for the disabled within each county boundary. People from enterprise boards and Leader boards could take an active role in this regard. The encouragement of people with disabilities to participate in the arts in each local authority area, with the assistance of the local authority arts officer, would also be welcome. Such a committee could be comprised of council members, FÁS representatives, people with disabilities and members of Leader boards and enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister reiterated the Government's commitment to developing services and the evidence speaks for itself. Additional funding of £91.662 million has been put in place, as well as a range of measures to meet the educational requirements of children with special needs. I welcome the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which ensures for the first time that people with disabilities must have equality of access to employment and training and, most importantly, equal opportunity for promotion. Discrimination in this area will at long last be outlawed. I also welcome the proposals in the Equal Status Bill to prohibit discrimination in areas such as education, provision of goods and services and accommodation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the sizeable funding that has been allocated each year, for example, this year £42.357 million has been provided. I support the views expressed by the Minister when he spoke in this debate yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Theresa Ahearn on tabling this motion. I take issue with what the Minister said last night in the debate. As an Opposition we would do less than our job if we did not put down a motion such as this, especially given the agreement of Members on the other side of the House who spoke about the needs and gaps in this area and the provision that is still required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland the Minister today launched a standards of care document. Ms Anne Donovan, president of the association, called on him to establish national standards for services which would be legally enforceable and monitored by an independent authority to ensure <Col N="859" /> that children and adults with a mental handicap would have the highest quality of services. She went on to say that research has shown that children and adults with a mental handicap are very vulnerable to abuse of all kinds. She urged families not to be afraid to speak up and said there would be an independent advocate for them to turn to when they wanted to report concern about services or lack of services. She also spoke about the lack of information, the &ldquo;Catch 22&rdquo; situation people often find themselves caught up in when trying to access services and the great problems that still exist in that area. The association made several recommendations in this regard. Given this, we would do less than our duty as an Opposition if we did not speak on these issues and bring them to the attention of the House to try and force the debate to proceed at a faster pace to ensure that more resources will be allocated.</P>
    <P>I accept that provision and awareness have increased. However, while we have come a long way we still have a long way to go. The disabled have been marginalised for many years and it is only in very recent years that there has been an increased impetus in this area.</P>
    <P>One of the submissions to the Commission on the Status of People with Disability states:</P>
    <P>People with disabilities do not want to be pitied, nor do they want their disabilities to be dismissed as of little importance. All that is required is a little respect, and basic needs and rights. Surely that is not too much to ask?</P>
    <P>That is the essence of this motion. It is not legislation, international disability awards nor high flown rhetoric or political point scoring that is required; it is basic rights and to have needs fulfilled, such as the right to leave home and travel on a bus without having to be carried or to crawl on to it and the right to personal assistant services for help with dressing and feeding.</P>
    <P>Many more people could live in independent accommodation if the personal assistant services were increased. I recognise that many have moved into communities and are coping well. I see it in my constituency and it is to be welcomed. However, the need is enormous.</P>
    <P>Other basic rights include the right for residential or day care for children or adults who have an intellectual, physical or sensory disability, rights for carers and the right to respite care for an adult with intellectual disability to provide a break for their elderly parents, or for parents with very young children. The health of mothers in my constituency who look after their children full-time at home has deteriorated. Their backs have given out from lifting the children, yet they have had to wait months to get a hoist. It is ridiculous that a basic provision, such as a hoist to help move a young child in and out of bed, should take several months. In the meantime a parent's back is wrecked. That is what is happening today.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for consensus on the issue of basic rights and needs. The House recently <Col N="860" /> debated the reports entitled A Strategy for Equality and Towards an Independent Future. We have admitted that in the past we failed to fully appreciate the rights and requirements of people with a disability. We are now putting that right. However, the motion points out the need to invest further. I agree with Deputy Eoin Ryan's call to make this a millennium project and do far more work to ensure that the necessary resources are provided.</P>
    <P>The motion is a timely reminder that services to people with disabilities are lacking behind the legislation. We must provide people with disabilities with the resources as well as the legislation to achieve and exercise their economic, social, civil and political rights. Legislation alone is not enough; resources are also needed to implement it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will focus on the area of transport, especially with regard to accessibility for wheelchair users. When the Minister of State recently visited Cork she pointed out her aim was to try to ensure that people with a physical disability would have the capability to lead as full and normal a life as possible. I welcome that. She illustrated her point well by pointing out that if some of us were to lose the use of our legs and be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of our lives because of an accident she hoped we would continue to have a similar quality of life in terms of mobility. If that is her aim I commend her, but it should be pointed out that there is little evidence to back up these fine words.</P>
      <P>There are significantly more than 500 wheelchair users in Cork city alone, yet there is little or no transport service provided to them by way of bus, taxi or train. In some cases people are prisoners in their homes unless a family member, carer or friend transports them.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about ensuring a decent quality of life for people in wheelchairs we must start by providing public transport that is accessible for all. That includes buses, trains and taxis. The Minister of State said there were six buses with wheelchair accessibility working in Dublin at present. She did not mention that there are 150 buses ordered for Dublin. How many of them will be wheelchair accessible? There is not a big cost difference. We should not order any buses that are not wheelchair accessible.</P>
      <P>We have a responsibility to provide a bus service for people in wheelchairs. It is not a case of charity or of feeling sorry for people. We have a legal responsibility in this regard. People in wheelchairs have a fundamental right to have access to a bus. If we say we cannot afford to invest in wheelchair accessible buses now, when the Government coffers are full and the economy shows no signs of slowing down, when will we be able to afford it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the few new buses coming to Cork are wheelchair accessible, which I welcome. However, that is only the beginning and I wish to ensure that the Minister of State stays focused on <Col N="861" /> providing as many buses with wheelchair accessibility as possible. If possible, every new bus must be wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>Approximately eight months ago, a large group  &ndash; approximately 120 &ndash; travelled from Cork to Dublin to celebrate a by-election victory. A good friend of mine was in a wheelchair and we had to carry him on to the train and carry his wheelchair separately. We then had to carry him &ndash; it was more like dragging him &ndash; down the aisle to sit him into his seat. It was a humiliating process for him and was very upsetting for his parents and others. We have a duty to ensure that trains have at least one carriage that is wheelchair accessible, especially on the very busy routes, such as the route from Cork to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The taxi service is probably the worst in this regard. At present there is no wheelchair accessible taxi service in Cork city. I and my constituency colleague, Deputy Clune, have been trying to raise an Adjournment debate on the matter in recent weeks but our efforts have been rejected because the Minister of State maintains it is the responsibility of local authorities to resolve the problem of wheelchair accessible taxi licences.</P>
    <P>The problem is not with the issuing of licences but with making it economically viable for taxi operators to run a taxi service for people who use wheelchairs. In Dublin, in particular, many operators of wheelchair accessible taxis, with the relevant licences, provide a service for other members of the public. We must ensure it is economically viable for operators who have been granted licences to carry people who use wheelchairs. They should not have to provide the service out of the goodness of their hearts It is the responsibility of the Minister, not the county council, to insert that in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise two matters with the Minister. I compliment her on her recent visit to Longford which, unfortunately, I was unable to attend.</P>
      <P>The Longford Wheelchair Association wants new transport for people with disabilities. While it has raised some funds for this purpose, it needs support from the health board. I raised this matter on a previous occasion and I hope the Minister will respond positively. Longford is one of the few towns in the Midland Health Board area that does not have a modern bus to cater for people with disabilities. The bus that is currently used is approximately eight or nine years old.</P>
      <P>Those with disabilities have a wonderful sense of humour and are great company. The rest of society should take inspiration from them. They deserve all the recognition they can get. They do not want sympathy, they want to be able to help themselves. The Government and the health boards can assist in this regard by making a positive contribution in the line of funding for transport and accessible buildings. Local authorities should take into account the needs of people with disabilities when planning housing developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> There are no respite care facilities in County Longford. Parents who care for people with disabilities need a few weeks break each year. People in County Longford must travel to Mullingar to avail of such services. I implore the Minister to provide respite care facilities in Longford. I ask the Minister to accede to my requests for wheelchair accessible transport and respite care facilities in Longford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Ahearn on her initiative in tabling this motion and on her work for people with disabilities. It is not acceptable, in the current economic climate, that once again in Private Members' time we have to urge the Government to provide for one of the most vulnerable groups in society, those with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities. It is disgraceful that many are awaiting the supply of aids and appliances, as pointed out by Deputy Ahern, which would improve their lives? Why should they have to wait for these appliances? It is difficult to understand why the Government will not provide the necessary funding to ensure a substantial reduction in the waiting list for such appliances, which would vastly improve the quality of life for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>We must stop the marginalisation and exclusion from many aspects of society of those with disabilities. A just and humane society would make it a priority to meet the legitimate needs of people with disabilities, such as residential services, respite care, training, education and employment. The current crisis must be dealt with in a humane, comprehensive and consultative fashion. The strong state of Exchequer finances provides a unique opportunity to make significant inroads into solving this unacceptable problem. The Minister has a moral and a political duty to do so. In supporting the motion, we must ensure the needs of people with disabilities are fully addressed. It is appalling that people with physical disabilities face hardship in their daily lives. I hope the Government gives a more positive response in the future than the amendment it tabled tonight.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that people with disabilities should be prevented from obtaining work, travelling and so on. Adequate services should be provided to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities to live in the community as independently as possible. In that regard, I refer to the successful personal assistance scheme in Limerick and pay tribute to the Centre for Independent Living in Newcastle West, which does an excellent job. Up to now it has depended on FÁS trainees to act as personal assistants. This scheme has been of great benefit to people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Irish Wheelchair Association on its work. It has shown that 2,667 people do not benefit from day centre activities and that 1,248 are physically isolated from society. This is not acceptable in this day and age. Some 1,500 people require aids and appliances and 1,375 require per<Col N="863" /> sonal assistants for their basic needs, such as getting dressed and eating.</P>
    <P>Cystic fibrosis has not been mentioned in the debate, even though it is one of the most commonly inherited diseases in Ireland. Health boards should provide more assistance for those who suffer from cystic fibrosis. I pay tribute to the Mid-Western Health Board which has introduced a new scheme for people with cystic fibrosis, including domiciliary physiotherapy, which is vital for sufferers of this disease. However, not enough is being done for such people. The Cystic Fibrosis Association is not adequately supported by the health boards. In particular, these people need services when they are ill. People with cystic fibrosis learn new techniques during the domiciliary physiotherapy sessions. It is essential, therefore, that health board services are made more accessible to those who suffer from this disease.</P>
    <P>I will quote my esteemed colleague, Deputy Hanafin, who spoke on the subject of mental handicap services on 11 November. She said a young woman she had met recently told her that if her child were a criminal, a cow or had a hurley in his left hand he would get more money from the State than if he had a disability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Ahearn for putting down this motion. It is an issue which unfortunately needs a great deal more discussion while the disabled need more help. It must be acknowledged that major improvements have been made in the past few years, yet there are many needs to be dealt with. The increase in the disability allowance in the past two years is nothing short of a disgrace. Old age pensions were increased by £11 during that period yet my neighbour who is on crutches only received an increase of £6. It is hard to justify why one able bodied man who happens to be over 66 years old and in receipt of a contributory pension should get an increase of £11. He is able to do some work yet his neighbour who is no longer able and depends on outsiders gets an increase of £6. Those people will judge this Government not by their words but by their deeds. A victim of MS who is on her own gets a total of £72 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue I wish to raise in the limited time available is the need for more accommodation. The single biggest worry of many of our elderly is what will happen their disabled adult children whom they now look after when they pass on. I recently spoke to the mother of a number of handicapped people who is now in her 80s. While one of her family gets respite from time to time, her main anxiety is that they will be looked after in an environment of which she feels they are worthy, somewhere local where their friends and neighbours can visit them, as they do at present. Another mother of a strong handicapped person finds it hard to handle that person on her own. Her husband works away, sometimes at a long <Col N="864" /> distance and she has a nervous problem. She does not want that family member to go into full-time care but she wants more respite to be available, especially at times when she has health problems.</P>
    <P>The health board and local voluntary groups, such as those in Threemilehouse, Doohamlet and many other places in the constituency and country, give tremendous support to the elderly and disabled. However, more is needed. Recently, a young teenager needed a better way of getting around. The people in the locality got together and raised the funds to buy a car for that family. The people of my area voted with their money to show that they want the disabled to be looked after in the best possible way. For some years I chaired a committee to raise funds for a child with cerebral palsy. While people may protest about money being spent in certain areas, they will not decry any Government spending what is needed to ensure that children with disabilities are properly looked after.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance has been increased in the past few years but, unfortunately, the amount of money someone can earn &ndash; the disregard &ndash; has not been increased in the past two years. I ask the Minister to look at this. There are anomalies. For example, in the case of a couple looking after a disabled child who are in receipt of an old age contributory pension and the carer's allowance, if the husband dies, the wife will go straight on to a widow's pension which is then the only money coming into that house. That is a major shock and the problem needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The availability of services in rural areas needs to be looked at; people living in Dublin have greater access to physiotherapy and other support services. Services must be available in rural areas to children with cerebral palsy, dyslexia, etc. I urge that more funds be provided to ensure that services are as available in rural Ireland as in Dublin city. We request no more or no less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Ahearn for putting down this motion. It is a fitting one and it is time this Government which promised so much in Opposition dealt with it. The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, was an excellent spokesperson in Opposition and I will not say she has not done some good &ndash; I accept she has. However, she promised a great deal more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deal with people with disabilities on a daily basis. Local authorities are not doing their job when it comes to people with disabilities. For example, in Ballina and Westport, business premises load their goods on the street making life difficult for those with disabilities. I do not know why we cannot introduce legislation to stop this. Traffic lights were recently erected in Westport by Mayo County Council. However, the signal to notify a blind person that he or she can cross the road when the lights are green was not provided. I had to raise the matter with the county council and the signal had to be provided as an afterthought. If the local authorities will not <Col N="865" /> implement the law, how can we expect the private sector to do it?</P>
    <P>The new buses which were recently provided in Dublin should be withdrawn and made wheelchair accessible. Taxpayers' money is being used to buy them so the orders should be withdrawn and they should be brought up to standard. How can we expect the private sector and businesses which have not been adapted for people with disabilities to assist people with disabilities when the State and local authorities will not implement the law?</P>
    <P>I recently received a representation from a constituent from north Mayo. He is in a wheelchair and could not use the lift in Ballina swimming pool which has been broken for weeks &ndash; and it is still not fixed. We are not being fair to people with disabilities. As some Deputies said, they do not want to be different. They want to live their lives like everyone else. They do not want people opening doors for them or lifting them in and out of shops, cinemas and dancehalls. They want to be able to go about their daily business like everyone else. That does not cost money. The lift in the swimming pool was out of use and should have been fixed. If it was provided for people without disabilities it would be fixed.</P>
    <P>This happens because people with disabilities do not have a strong enough voice. Michael Corbett from Mayo has met the Ministers of State, Deputies Mary Wallace and Moffatt and other public representatives, is trying to put a scheme on a statutory basis and is encountering obstacles from the State, the health board and everyone. He depends on FÁS schemes. However, now they are being cut back. I recently received a letter stating that Mayo will lose 90 FÁS schemes. Who will be affected? The weakest in society. The golf, GAA or soccer clubs will not be affected because they have strong voices. When the bank manager rings the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney or the Taoiseach or when the secretary of the GAA club promises 30 or 40 tickets for next year's All-Ireland, they will get FÁS schemes. People with disabilities will not.</P>
    <P>All Governments and politicians have promised them so much over the years. The months from December 1998 to May 1999 produced record revenue receipts. The time is right for these people to get a few pounds from the Minister for Finance. If we do not help them now, we will not be able to help them when times worsen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Cowen, addressed the House on the needs of people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities. He is willing to have the Government's commitment to improving the quality of life of people with disabilities judged on its record. Making statements expressing the appropriate sentiments is not what is needed. The Government has put substantial additional funding into services for people with disabilities and <Col N="866" /> has quickly allocated much needed funding to tackle urgent problems. Within months of taking office, £10 million was allocated for aids and appliances, to eliminate accumulated debts of voluntary sector service providers and to fund additional respite and long-term residential places.</P>
      <P>However, the Government does not wish to dwell on past achievements as there is an ongoing commitment to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities. Vital structures are being created which will facilitate the planning and implementation of the appropriate initiatives. Regional co-ordinating committees which will deal with physical and sensory disability services are being created in the health boards, as recommended by the report, Towards an Independent Future. These will bring the statutory and voluntary sectors and the consumers together to co-ordinate services and plan their development.</P>
      <P>A national database of physical and sensory disability service needs will be set up, which will provide the accurate data necessary to plan service development more effectively. Similar structures already in place in the intellectual disability area have proved very helpful. The document Services for People with a Mental Handicap &ndash; An Assessment of Need 1997-2001 exemplifies what can be done in the accurate planning of services with the availability of appropriate tools. The Government is committed to fully funding the service developments outlined in that document. Each regional co-ordinating committee dealing with physical and sensory disabilities will agree a five year costed plan on the development of services, which will form the basis for a national plan along the lines of the Assessment of Need document.</P>
      <P>The lack of accessible public transport has been raised by Opposition Members. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is committed to providing public transport facilities, fully accessible to all, at the earliest possible date. Each of the CIE companies has now established user groups representative of people with disabilities. Their input greatly assisted the companies in their ongoing programmes of improving the suitability of their services for mobility-impaired customers. Accessible double-decker buses are currently being tested in Dublin city and Cork city to ensure that they are operationally viable. If this proves to be the case, all urban services will as soon as possible use the accessible vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past two years the Government has invested a total of £53 million in services for people with intellectual disabilities and £38.662 million in services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This makes a total of more than £91 million in two years compared with only £73 million provided over four and a half years by the previous Government. An annual average of £16 million has almost trebled to a new average of £45 million per year. This Government is committed to promoting the welfare of people with <Col N="867" /> disabilities by every means at its disposal. This is achieved by guaranteeing them their rights, enacting appropriate legislation and making the public aware of the problems and its role in solving them. The Government has already provided substantial funding to achieve these aims and will continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Ahearn on raising this important subject. We must remind ourselves that although good work is being done, much more needs to be done. It is pointless criticising each other or what was done in the past as we must look to the future. Future advances must help people with disabilities, such as a child born with a disability or a young or middle-aged person who, through a serious accident, has a disability that must be overcome. My own experience indicates that these people want to meet that challenge if they are given the opportunity. They do not wish to be a burden on the State, their families, friends or neighbours and above all they do not want handouts or to be patronised. They should be given the opportunities which are available to the rest of the population, such as access to education. This is still not fully available and some improvements are needed. Teachers are prepared to accept these but back up is needed in schools with children with special needs, who benefit by entering the education system. The special correction of examinations for these children is not up to date and should be flexible, allowing young people to enter third level institutions to achieve qualifications. These young people will adapt to the new modern skills needed, such as computer skills and can, as a result, take up meaningful employment. Even those confined to a wheelchair or those with speech disabilities can take up meaningful work and receive a salary, with no need for handouts. They want to prove that they can take their place in society. If we can approach the provision of support for people with disabilities in this way, then we will succeed.</P>
      <P>There are many improvements in household equipment which enable people with disabilities to live independently but they have a fear of something happening when they are alone in the house. There is an expensive bleeper system available which I was appalled to find is not available on the medical card scheme and the grant aid towards it is very little. If people with a disability wish to live on their own, a bleeper which allows them to contact someone when they are in difficulty should be provided free of charge by the State. That alone would give them the confidence to carry on with their life. If we can achieve this, this debate will have been worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for giving us the opportunity to address disability needs. As we approach the end of the 20th century, the rapid and wide ranging advances in medicine, rehabilitation techniques, mechanical aids and <Col N="868" /> the adaptations to motor vehicles mean that most people with disabilities can not only expect to live longer but to have more mobile and meaningful lives.</P>
      <P>The elimination of architectural and environmental barriers was necessary to allow such citizens to capitalise on their increased mobility and circulate freely and equally and to be able to participate in the everyday life of the community. Part M of the building regulations came into effect in June 1993. This applied to new buildings, extensions to existing buildings, works associated with new or materially refurbished buildings and to material changes of usage. Regrettably, Part M was not extended to cover the wider external environment nor to include tactile circulation routes for those with significant visual impairments, nor for retrospective provision of access to existing buildings.</P>
      <P>The NRB's design criteria formed the basis for the design of accessible buildings and facilities and the basis for the work of access groups. The high expectations of Part M, however, have never been fully realised. Even now it is obvious that many architects, builders, designers, engineers, planners and building control personnel are either unaware of Part M's existence or confused about its implementation. The same apparent confusion exists in projects by the Office of Public Works, the National Building Agency, the technical design and planning sections of the Department of Education and Science, Iarnród Éireann, the health boards and other statutory bodies. There is a lack of understanding of the requirements on the part of the decision makers and those drawing up the plans.</P>
      <P>We see examples daily. There might be access to a building but there is no access within that building. I held a seminar as part of National Disability Awareness Week to facilitate the Kerry network for the disabled. While there was good access to the venue of the meeting, there was no access within it. The hotel in question was built recently. There has been a breakdown in communication about the requirements. Until builders and architects have to apply for a licence similar to a fire certificate for access, there will be no interest in providing access. I ask the Minister and the Minister for Health and Children to consider introducing an access certificate similar to a fire certificate before planning permission is granted. If that was to happen architects, planners and engineers would soon understand the requirements of Part M.</P>
      <P>I have responsibility for the Office of Public Works. There are 1,300 buildings under the supervision of the Office of Public Works. Many Garda stations which were built before 1991 have not been refurbished and are not accessible to the public. No audit has been carried out. When I ask how many are inaccessible, no one can tell me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a gap. Money is available and being spent but there is a long way to go. We should act together on this. We can all help. We are all <Col N="869" /> observers who can see what has gone wrong. This is a motion we can all support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate &ndash;  those who supported the motion and the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who will vote against it, although the sentiments they expressed here are in total agreement with the motion.</P>
      <P>I am saddened by the Government's response. I was disappointed, but not surprised, by the partisan and aggressive response of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. I remind him that, as I said in my speech last night, this motion was intended to unite this House, not to divide it. Such good intentions are useless when the Minister operates only with an adversarial approach and is incapable of recognising constructive criticism and advice.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not addressed any of the real issues. He accused me of using this motion cynically during an election campaign. I remind him that this is the third motion in seven months on the subject of services for people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities. There were no election campaigns last October or last December when I tabled the two previous motions. I also remind the Minister that when his party was in Opposition, in the space of 30 months, not one Private Members' motion was tabled by Fianna Fáil on behalf of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister accuses the Opposition parties of making rash promises and indulging in auction politics. This is not the case. Fianna Fáil produced an excellent document on disability while it was in Opposition which contained many promises. Unfortunately, most of it was ignored when the Programme for Government was written. Unfortunately for the wheelchair users, in spite of what the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt says, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, had not read her party's policy on accessible transport when she allowed Bus Éireann to order 150 new buses which exclude access for people who are mobility impaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it clear that all parties in this House, including the Government parties, acknowledge that there is shortfall in service provision. We all <Col N="870" /> agree what must be done. This motion simply asks the Government to deal with these issues as a priority and not to stick rigidly to timetables which were agreed when the resources were not as plentiful as they are now.</P>
    <P>In his contribution, the Minister took his usual immature tack of &ldquo;we did more than you&rdquo;. He should grow up and deal with the real issues. Instead of congratulating himself on all the work he had done, he should take a long, hard look at reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister may think it is only the Opposition parties who are critical of his approach. He cannot ignore the fact that those with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are dissatisfied, disappointed and angry with him and the Government. How do we know that? We know because, in the two years during which Deputy Cowen has been Minister for Health and Children, there have been two major public demonstrations by people with disabilities protesting at the lack of services, thought and action from a Government which promised so much. Let Minister Cowen think about that. What does he think they were doing? Does he think that they travelled from their homes, faced all the difficulties with transport, gathered in Parnell Square holding placards, travelled from O'Connell Street to Kildare Street to the gates of Leinster House to hand him a thank you card? They travelled because they are angry and frustrated, because they have waited too long. They travelled because the Minister promised much and delivered little.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, think Mr. John Doyle sat in his wheelchair outside CIE headquarters for two nights last winter? Does he think Mr. Doyle wanted to congratulate the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, for making him wait another two years for a wheelchair accessible bus? Mr. Doyle protested because he is sick of having to be carried on to a bus. People with disabilities are sick of having to crawl. They are sick of having to wait patiently in line for the basic services. Their anger is justified. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister for Defence to clarify the kind of cover the Army is capable of providing in the event of an all-out strike by the 800 firefighters in the Dublin area, a strike which is threatened to commence from 3 June. Following a claim by PDFORRA that the logistical support units which normally provide services during strikes have been cut by 50 per cent under the Government's Defence Forces implementation plan and the statement to the effect that the Defence Forces will not be able to supply the necessary numbers, the situation is extremely serious. The public has depended on the Defence Forces in the past in crises and is entitled to depend on them in a situation such as this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Defence Forces for their willingness in the past to respond to emergencies. I am concerned about the serious situation which could arise on 3 June if this problem is not resolved. I urge the Minister to immediately inform the public what kind of cover the Army is able to provide. What exactly does he mean by &lsquo;emergency cover' and how long will it take for the units to become operational? The public must be reassured that any eventuality could be catered for in the event of a strike. The fact that PDFORRA has expressed grave concern <Col N="873" /> about the lack of resources is a cause for alarm.</P>
    <P>The Dublin fire brigade service deals with 25,000 calls annually. Calls are received almost every half an hour. A total of 800 firefighters in the Dublin area provide a 24 hour, seven day per week service. It is appalling that such a serious threat is posed to services which are intended to protect life and property.</P>
    <P>How many members of the Defence Forces are available for this work? Has training commenced and, if so, what is its nature? How many appliances will be available and where will they be based? Will safe work systems be put in place for those involved? This issue cannot be left hanging. I thank the Minister for coming into the House to respond to my questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the roles of the Defence Forces, as set by the Government, is to assist in connection with the maintenance of essential services. The Defence Forces have been tasked to assist where essential public services are disrupted. This has involved the provision of transport, fire brigade or engineering services.</P>
      <P>Normally, the involvement of the Defence Forces in the provision of essential services is as a last resort when all other possible avenues have been explored. I understand that talks are still taking place in the hope of averting the industrial action. I hope these talks will be successful and I will address that issue shortly on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>In the event of a fire service strike proceeding, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces has confirmed that preparations to make military personnel available to provide emergency cover are at an advanced stage. If the need arises, the Defence Forces will be in a position to provide the same level of emergency cover as on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>Any suggestions that the Army's capacity to provide such assistance has been reduced are completely groundless. However, Deputies must bear in mind that the service provided by the Defence Forces in the event of the strike going ahead will be an emergency one only and could not possibly replicate the standard provided by the Fire Brigade Service.</P>
      <P>In the past, the Defence Forces have responded to a variety of calls to maintain essential services. Military personnel always rise to meet the challenge with a &ldquo;can do&rdquo; approach. The public at large has always appreciated the assistance and efforts of the Defence Forces. Accordingly, I am somewhat bemused at the response by PDFORRA. It is frankly ludicrous to assert that the Defence Forces are not up to the job. It is particularly disheartening when such a groundless allegation is made by an organisation which purports to be concerned for the image of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise again that the Chief of Staff has assured me that the training and equipment will <Col N="874" /> be available should the strike go ahead. It must be borne in mind, however, that we cannot replicate what is available but we will do everything necessary to supply emergency services should the strike go ahead. The hope is that it will not.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise with the Minister for Health and Children an important matter concerning the future of the surgical wing of Bantry General Hospital. Is it true that the future of surgical services in the hospital might be in danger? Will the Minister of State give a categorical assurance to the House tonight that surgical services will continue in Bantry General Hospital because rumours to the contrary have been circulating? </P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State explain why a second surgeon's position has been left vacant for the past 12 years since the former surgeon, Mr. Baker, retired 12 years ago? Will he explain why a second anaesthetist position in the hospital has been left vacant for the same 12 year period? </P>
      <P>Comhairle na n-Ospidéal has a recognised policy that all surgical hospitals should have the services of two surgeons and two anaesthetists. Will the Minister of State explain the reason the two positions in Bantry General Hospital have not been filled? Will he, in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, authorise that those two vacant positions be filled as soon as possible?</P>
      <P>I need not remind the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, of the importance of Bantry General Hospital to the vast hinterland of west Cork and south Kerry, embracing a sprawling area from Courtmacsherry to Waterville in Kerry. The Minister of State visited the constituency as late as last week and he is familiar with the vast terrain that makes up south west Cork and south Kerry. It is of paramount importance that the Minister of State gives me a categorical assurance tonight that the surgical services in Bantry General Hospital will continue and that the two vacant positions will be filled. I urge the Minister of State to put on the record that he will take immediate steps to fill those two positions, thereby securing the surgical department of this hospital.</P>
      <P>I do not want Bantry General Hospital downgraded to a geriatric hospital. The area is so vast that patients could die in transit to the University Hospital in Cork. Parts of my constituency in the Beara Peninsula are 125 miles from Cork city. The Mizen Head peninsula is almost 100 miles from Cork city, and then there is the Muntervary peninsula.</P>
      <P>It is of paramount importance that the surgical wing in Bantry General Hospital is retained. I urge the Minister of State to give me that assurance tonight.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have <Col N="875" /> the opportunity afforded to me this evening by Deputy Sheehan to address the House on the issue of provision of surgical services at Bantry Hospital and to reassert Minister Cowen's commitment to the continued provision of services at Bantry.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Bantry General Hospital plays an important part in the provision of hospital services to the people of west Cork. The hospital has a total bed complement of 92, which includes 68 beds with surgical, medical, intensive care, geriatric and respite facilities, and 24 long-stay beds.</P>
      <P>The provision of services at the hospital is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board. In line with the obligations this entails, the Southern Health Board has undertaken an assessment of services at Bantry General Hospital to ensure the services continue to meet the needs of the people served by the hospital.</P>
      <P>Following this assessment, the board established a working group to prepare a plan setting out the various options for the future development of services at Bantry General Hospital, including surgical services. This process is under way in consultation with a wide range of interested parties such as consultant staff and general practitioners. The board is confident this review will further enhance the services already provided at Bantry General Hospital and make them more responsive to the needs of the area.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to discontinue surgical services at Bantry General Hospital. I hope that is reassuring to the Deputy. The future role of surgery will be explored in the context of the plan being prepared by the Southern Health Board.  The work currently in hand on the preparation of a plan for the development of services at the hospital clearly demonstrates the commitment to the future role of the hospital in the provision of services to the people of west Cork, and the Minister looks forward to the outcome of the process.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that Minister Cowen's commitment to the development of services in the Southern Health Board area includes those at Bantry General Hospital. I am confident that Bantry General Hospital will continue to play a full and active role in the provision of services in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise the threatened strike by firefighters in Dublin and throughout the country. I understand the Labour Court intervened in the dispute today and that discussions are now scheduled. I hope those discussions will lead to a resolution of the dispute, and I welcome the intervention of the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> We tend to take the fire services for granted until we need them. Firefighters risk their lives every day on our behalf dealing with big and small fires, chemical spills, rescuing people, accidents and cleaning up the aftermath. A good fire service is an essential element in providing safety and security for our people. Over the years, people have become much more conscious of the dangers of fires. Modern society brings its own hazards &ndash; fuel storage depots, chemical factories, high rise buildings, underground car parks and many others.</P>
    <P>The firefighters in Dublin have served strike notice and firefighters throughout the country have indicated support for their Dublin colleagues. The threatened withdrawal of fire services is a serious development with potentially disastrous consequences. The fire services depend on the training and skills of firefighters, skills that are not easily acquired. Even with the best will in the world, there is no adequate substitute for the skill and expertise of the fire services. No organisation can provide the same degree of security or cover. In the best of times and with the best will in the world, the Defence Forces simply do not have the personnel or the number of tenders to provide the level of cover required in a modern, busy city.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details of the dispute but it is well known that it involves a claim arising from the pay relationship between gardaí and firefighters which spans more than 30 years. However, there are other issues involved, specifically proposals by Dublin Corporation to reduce the number of appliances and personnel available to respond to incidents. I understand, for instance, that the corporation intends to reduce manpower in all single pump fire stations such as Tallaght, Rathfarnham, Finglas, Blanchardstown and Kilbarrack, while also reducing the number of staff on special aerial appliances. There is also a proposal to move one of the fire appliances from Donnybrook to Tallaght. I am concerned about this from the perspective of service to the public. Ten years ago a study of the Dublin fire service indicated that, compared with similar cities, it was under-resourced in equipment and personnel. Therefore, it is disturbing to hear proposals about the further reduction in personnel in the Dublin fire service, given the phenomenal growth of the city in the past ten years and the future anticipated growth.</P>
    <P>It is also disturbing to hear of the transfer of appliances from one station to another &ndash; robbing Peter to pay Paul. Transferring the appliance from Donnybrook to Tallaght would leave Donnybrook with just one appliance. This is an area of high population with many institutions &ndash; hospitals, universities, the RDS, where major public events take place, and Lansdowne Road. There are also a huge number of residences, hotels and various places where public events take place.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to get into the detail of the matters in dispute between the union and manage<Col N="877" /> ment. However, in the public interest, the Minister should give some attention to what is happening and ensure that the standard of service and the equipment and personnel required to provide a safe fire service for the people is not diminished by short-term productivity measures which may comply with some pay agreement, but which may undermine the quality and safety of the Dublin fire service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. My colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House and asked me to clarify the position and to correct a number of inaccuracies which are being reported on his behalf.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, 19 May, the Department of the Environment and Local Government was informed by Dublin Corporation that strike notice had been served on it by the fire brigade unions and that notice was due to expire on 3 June. The corporation requested that arrangements be made to secure the assistance of the Defence Forces to provide emergency cover for the duration of any strike. This request was immediately conveyed to the Department of Defence in accordance with long standing, established procedures. The initial request was conveyed by telephone and followed up formally in writing on Friday, 21 May. The House will also be aware that, over the past few days, other full-time brigades also decided to take strike action in support of their Dublin colleagues.</P>
      <P>As regards alternative fire cover, the Minister is satisfied that the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces responded promptly to the request for assistance and that the Defence Forces are co-operating fully. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is liaising closely with the Defence Forces and other Departments and agencies with a view to ensuring the maximum possible emergency fire cover in the event of strike action.</P>
      <P>While the Defence Forces will provide the best possible cover in the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to expect that they could provide the same level of service as the full-time brigades &ndash; Dublin alone has almost 800 fully trained fire fighters. In these circumstances, there is an onus on the unions to act responsibly and ensure that any strike action does not contribute to loss of life or gross property damage.</P>
      <P>As in previous disputes involving other essential services where life was at risk, it is hoped that the unions would agree an appropriate protocol to ensure that, in the event of strike action, personnel are available to respond in any emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the strike action itself, it is important not to prejudice any possible talks. However, it is essential to clarify one issue. The unions balloted their members on the issue of parity with the Garda Síochána. However, parity <Col N="878" /> is not an issue &ndash; it is agreed and there is no need for this strike.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes this issue can be resolved through discussion without strike action. The chairman of the Labour Court, Mr. Finbarr Flood, has today invited both sides to discussions with a view to finding a resolution and these talks are scheduled to take place next Monday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue because three children from the one family attending Ballinalee national school have to pay for transport. The Minister and the Department should be more flexible. There are procedures and rules to which the Department has adhered over the years but there should be some flexibility, especially in this case concerning three children from the one family.</P>
      <P>The cost of school transport is high and cannot be afforded by some families. Primary level is a critical stage in the development of pupils. Some families experience additional stress if they have to transport students to and from school every day. The days when people could walk to school are long gone. Transport has to be provided in rural areas but it is costly. The Minister and his officials should look favourably on this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Belton for raising this matter which gives me the opportunity to outline the position in relation to school transport for pupils from the Corlinan area to Ballinalee national school.</P>
      <P>By way of general comment, I should explain some basic facts about the school transport scheme. Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, has a responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 156,000 primary and post-primary pupils to schools. My Department has responsibility to ensure that the State gets the best possible value for the money spent on this service. It does not come cheaply. In 1998, the net cost to the State was about £40 million.</P>
      <P>One of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly. I should explain that, under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, only eligible children qualify for free transport. In order to be eligible, children under ten years of age must live at least two miles from, and be attending, their nearest national school or school of amalgamation, while older children must live at least three miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eligibility may only be determined by reference to the nearest appropriate school as defined by my Department in accordance with the terms of the school transport scheme. Factors such as parish boundaries or a tradition of attendance by <Col N="879" /> certain families are not relevant in determining eligibility to a particular school.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of paragraph 1.3 of the primary school transport scheme, where a school is closed and amalgamated with another, children in the closed school area, i.e., children for whom the closed school would have been their nearest had it remained open, are eligible for free transport to the school of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>The children mentioned by Deputy Belton reside 1.9 miles from Soran closed school and 2.4 miles from Lislea closed school. Accordingly, they reside in the Soran closed school area. Soran school closed and amalgamated with Killoe national school. Therefore, under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, they are eligible for free transport to Killoe national school only.</P>
    <P>Children who do not qualify for free transport on age or distance grounds may, however, be allowed avail of concessionary fare paying transport. Fare paying tickets are issued subject to the condition that there is accommodation available on the vehicle after all eligible children have been catered for and provided there is no extra cost to the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> I understand in this case there is room available on the service to Ballinalee national school which passes adjacent to the family home. Accordingly, my Department is prepared to allow the pupils involved avail of concessionary fare paying transport to Ballinalee national school as the written agreement of the board of management to the provision of such transport has been secured. Tickets may be purchased from the local Bus Éireann office in Athlone. The current charge for concessionary fare paying transport is £20 per pupil per term.</P>
    <P>I regret that it would not be open to my Department to allow free transport to pupils who are ineligible under the terms of the school transport scheme. This would lead to an increased demand from other applicants in similar circumstances throughout the country.</P>
    <P>While being sympathetic to the transport needs of the family concerned, my Department has to consider the operation of the school transport scheme as a whole and the requirement not to breach guidelines which would have financial and policy implications for the transport service overall.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 May 1999.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the reduction of European interest rates is appropriate to the Irish economy at this time; his further views on whether the reduction entails an inflationary risk for Ireland; and the measures, if any, he envisages to counteract any risk.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13842/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): As the Deputy is aware, with the advent of economic and monetary union interest rates will be set by the European Central Bank taking account of conditions across the euro-zone. In the event that economic cycles may not be wholly synchronised, this complicates the conduct of monetary policy in achieving price stability in all member states.</P>
    <P>As regards the appropriate interest rate for the Irish economy at this stage, all the indicators suggest that growth remains strong. As I have outlined on a number of occasions the rapid economic growth we have experienced is giving rise to some pressures. There have been very significant increases in the price of housing which remain a concern to the Government. There are also emerging skills shortages in the labour market which have led to some wage inflation, most notably in sectors such as construction and IT. These trends are being monitored closely given the importance of appropriate wage developments in supporting the economy's underlying competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Given the economy's rapid growth, and the emerging pressures in the labour market, a period of more moderate growth would be welcome. In all probability, this latest reduction is likely to give some additional boost to already buoyant domestic demand.</P>
    <P>However, it should be noted that despite these <Col N="882" /> concerns inflation remains low. As measured by the consumer price index, inflation was 1.4 per cent in the year to April. This represents a significant fall from the peak of 3.2 per cent in August last, although part of this fall is due to the impact of lower mortgage interest rates.</P>
    <P>With Ireland's participation in EMU there is now a greater onus on both budgetary and incomes policy to support stable prices and non-inflationary growth. Keeping inflation low was one of the key objectives of the 1999 budget. While delivering on promised tax reductions and addressing social and infrastructural needs, the budget also forecast a further significant general Government surplus and a fall in the debt-GDP ratio. By running a significant surplus, the Government sought to avoid adding unduly to domestic demand. This prudent approach to budgetary policy should help to contain emerging price pressures.</P>
    <P>Moderate pay increases are also essential if price stability is to be maintained. The next pay agreement faces a crucial challenge in maintaining competitiveness. This is a challenge for all of the social partners and represents a major element of Government policy.</P>

      <P>The basic income proposal of the Conference of Religious in Ireland is currently being examined by a Partnership 2000 working group chaired by the Taoiseach's Department. As part of this process, a consultancy study is being carried out in two phases. Consultants have been appointed to carry out both the first and second phases of this study. The first phase will prepare a costing of the proposal and is nearing completion. The second phase will provide an assessment of the dynamic impact of the introduction of a basic income, and is expected to commence shortly. On completion of these consultancy studies, the Partnership 2000 working group will be in a position to complete its own deliberations on the issue. My Department is represented on the Partnership 2000 working group and participates fully in its work. The Government's policy programme An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to prepare a Green Paper on the subject of basic income.</P>

      <P>The effect of a minimum wage of £4.40 an hour is <Col N="883" /> being examined at present by an interdepartmental group established by the Government. The group's report will incorporate an independent study carried out by an ESRI-led group of consultants, who examined both the macro-economic and the sectoral impact of a national minimum wage. On receipt of the group's report, which is expected within the next few weeks, the Government would intend to publish the findings in full.</P>
      <P>The Government will then proceed to prepare detailed legislation to ensure that the national minimum wage is implemented from April 2000. The social partners are being consulted at all points in these developments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that pending these imminent developments I am unable to enter into more specific comment on the likely effect of the minimum wage.</P>

      <P>The Government in its policy manifesto An Action Programme for the Millennium makes it clear that it intends to take a practical rather than an ideological approach to the future of State companies working in the spirit of social partnership and consensus. It is committed to doing whatever is necessary to enable State companies to be competitive and cost-effective providers of vital public services to the benefit of the consumer. Additional capital needs, when they cannot be met internally, can be met through strategic alliances, employee share participation, or through long-term investment by pension funds. The objective of this approach is to ensure that they remain growing vigorous healthy companies providing high quality employment at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>At the moment, there are many alternative uses for Government capital spending including, for example, expenditure for the development of the national infrastructure. Equity markets are available for companies operating in the sectors in which State companies operate to finance their capital needs. As the Deputy is also aware Irish pension funds have indicated for a long time that they would welcome further investment opportunities in the Irish economy. This would obviate the need for the diversion of resources to overseas equity markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Government has not categorically ruled out any further equity injections into State companies, under the EU treaties the European Commission closely examine proposals for equity injections or other supports for State companies <Col N="884" /> by member state Governments with a view to determining whether or not they are compatible with EU competition rules.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government decided last year to dispose of the State's interest in ICC bank. My Department is currently fully engaged in giving effect to this decision and the preparatory work in connection with the sale is progressing with the full co-operation of the board, management and staff of the bank.</P>
      <P>On 11 February last, following a competitive process, I appointed ABN Amro and McCann Fitzgerald to advise me in relation to the sale of my interest in the bank. My advisers are currently working closely with the bank and its advisers in preparing the necessary documentation and agreeing the appropriate procedures for the sale process.</P>
      <P>In the context of the sale, the Government authorised me to enter into negotiations with staff on an ESOP of up to 5 per cent of the State's shareholding in return for change in the bank and on the purchase of a further 9.9 per cent stake by the staff on a current valuation basis, on the lines of arrangements agreed in Telecom Eireann. Discussions on the ESOP are ongoing and I hope these will be brought to a conclusion shortly.</P>
      <P>As soon as all the necessary due diligence arrangements in relation to the sale process are in place, expressions of interest in acquiring the State's remaining shareholding will be sought. I would hope that this process will commence by the end of June.</P>
      <P>The sale of ICC Bank will require the enactment of primary legislation to repeal the ICC Bank Acts, 1993 to 1997. My officials are currently engaged in reviewing the legislative requirements.</P>
      <P>Subject to regulatory clearances, it is expected that the sale transaction will be completed in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1998, agreement was reached with the EU Commission on the phasing out of the preferential IFSC regime. The effect of this agreement is that no new projects may be approved under the IFSC <Col N="885" /> regime after 1999, while the number of new projects which may be approved in 1999 is subject to a limit of 67 &ndash; the same number as was approved under the same EU agreement in 1998.</P>
      <P>Following the agreement with the EU Commission, my Department introduced new arrangements for allocating the limited number of approvals available in 1998 and 1999 between competing proposals. Judging by the large number of applications received for the limited number of approvals available, it is clear that the centre continues to be an attractive location for international financial services operations.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, however, once the 1999 quota has been allocated, the preferential IFSC regime will not be available to any further new projects in the international financial services area. Existing IFSC companies will, of course, continue to benefit from the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax until their tax certificates expire. The challenge, then, is how to ensure that Ireland continues to be an attractive location for international financial services operations in the future, in the absence of the specific IFSC regime. In this regard, the Government recently adopted a new strategy for the development of the international financial services industry in Ireland, which was published by the Taoiseach on 1 March. The objective of the strategy is to maintain a vibrant and growing international financial services industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC. The strategy is based on the achievement of a set of specific priority objectives, work on which is already well in hand.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's query about the euro, and whether its impact has been evaluated in the context of the IFSC, this issue was considered by the ESRI in 1996, in the context of its study on the economic implications for Ireland of EMU. The ESRI concluded that EMU was, on balance, likely to have a neutral effect on the IFSC. One of the 19 strategy priorities set out in the recently published strategy document is the preparation of a report on the actual impact of the euro for the international financial services industry in Ireland, outlining strategic opportunities and threats arising and appropriate responses. I understand that work on this report is ongoing.</P>

It is not my intention to express any views on the opinions of either the ECB or the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>

    <P>The CSO data indicate that average weekly earnings of industrial workers increased by 5.1 per cent in the year to September 1998. The increase in average hourly earnings was 5.8 per cent over the same period.</P>
    <P>Average weekly earnings in the banking, insurance and building societies sector increased by 4.2 per cent in the year to September 1998.</P>
    <P>In the construction sector average weekly earnings increased by 6.3 per cent in the year to September 1998 &ndash; the hourly rate increased by 7.9 per cent while the number of hours worked decreased by 1.7 per cent. Skilled operatives saw their weekly earnings increase by 12.3 per cent in the year to September 1998 reflecting an increase of 10.3 per cent in the hourly rate and an increase of 1.8 per cent in the average number of hours worked.</P>
    <P>Average weekly earnings of unskilled workers increased by 3.8 per cent over the same period with the hourly rate increasing by 5.7 per cent and the hours worked decreasing by 1.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the public sector average annual weekly earnings increased by 4.7 per cent in the year to September 1998.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has estimated that in the economy generally private sector wages increased by 5.5 per cent in 1998 when carryover from previous year's wage increases, and other elements are included.</P>
    <P>As we can see from the figures above some pressures are emerging in certain sectors, possibly reflecting sectoral labour shortages in some instances. The Government has increased substantially its investment in high-tech education and training to help ease skill shortages. At the less skilled end of the market catering and retailing are also experiencing labour shortages. A key priority for the Government, in its taxation and other policies, is to further encourage and assist the long-term unemployed to avail of the employment opportunities now available and to bring about a much greater match between the potential supply of labour and the demand which is evident in the marketplace. The recently announced FÁS initiative to actively encourage inward migration in the order of 10,000 should <Col N="888" /> also help to alleviate labour and skills shortages. Increasing both skilled and unskilled labour supply should help to dampen wage pressures.</P>

      <P>In the 1999 budget last December, I announced the standard rating of the basic personal and PAYE allowances as the first step in a move to a full tax credit system, and this was given effect in the 1999 Finance Act. I also announced my intention to complete the changeover to tax credits in future budgets.  That remains the position. I would propose that the remaining non-standard rated allowances should be converted to tax credits as part of this process. However, there will be a number of issues to consider in this regard, and my Department will be examining these issues in conjunction with other interested parties. My priority is to complete the move to tax credits. There are no plans at this stage to introduce refundable tax credits.</P>

      <P>The broad economic policy guidelines are currently <Col N="889" /> being finalised and it is hoped that they will be adopted at ECOFIN in July.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the guidelines are produced on an annual basis but have taken on an increased significance for member states this year as a result of EMU. The guidelines focus on the need for sound budgetary policies within the context of the Stability and Growth Pact and for structural reform measures of product, capital and labour markets. Achievement of these objectives will be of vital importance for ensuring sustainable economic and employment growth throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>While the guidelines are based on Commission recommendations which were drawn up in March, member states have played an important role in contributing to them. The guidelines have been the subject of intense discussion at recent meetings of the Economic Policy Committee, the Economic and Financial Committee and the ECOFIN Council. I myself have used the opportunity, on two occasions, at recent meetings of ECOFIN, to express Ireland's views in relation to the guidelines.</P>
      <P>The first part of the guidelines recommends economic policy priorities for the EU for the medium term. Time precludes me from referring to each and every suggestion that we made. However, I am happy to outline some of them. For example, we suggested amendments to better emphasise the role of the proposed new European Employment Pact in terms of an open dialogue with the European social partners. On the tax front, we emphasised the need for recommendations to be in line with the conclusions of the Vienna European Council. Furthermore, we drew attention to the potential role of telecommunications liberalisation in terms of promoting electronic commerce and the information society.</P>
      <P>In relation to the section on Ireland, our input has been significant in a number of ways. It was important to ensure that all references were accurate reflections of our current economic situation, in particular in relation to our budgetary position and our record to date on structural reform. A significant number of changes we suggested have been taken on board.</P>
      <P>Changes we suggested, for example, highlighted the fact that while both venture capital and research and development in Ireland are modest by international standards, improvements have been made recently. Also, as regards labour market policies, we emphasised the need for a balanced approach between active and preventative measures to reduce unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment.</P>

      <P>I understand from my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government that, under the Kyoto Protocol, Ireland's target is to limit the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the period 2008-12.</P>
      <P>I also understand that a national strategy is being prepared for Government approval at the earliest possible date. The strategy will provide a framework for achieving Ireland's Kyoto commitment, building upon existing measures and developing additional policies and measures for implementation in all sectors in a cost effective and environmentally sound manner.</P>
      <P>As is usual practice, the effects of all proposed taxation measures and changes are considered in the context of preparations for the annual budget and it is not usual to indicate these in advance.</P>
      <P>In my budget speech last December, I introduced some measures, including a new higher rate of vehicle registration tax for luxury vehicles to assist in meeting our environmental obligations. I also reduced the excise duty on liquid petroleum gas used as a motor fuel. As the Deputy will be aware from my budget speech, I stated that we needed to put in place an agreed indirect tax policy which will assist us in meeting our international obligations on CO2 emissions. I believe that such a policy, needs the support of all sections of the community as represented by the social partners. I proposed that the formulation of such agreed policy measures would form part of the discussions on the successor to Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>The loan in question was at AAA rate and was raised in 1981 by the Beaumont Hospital Board, and not the Department of Health.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the data are not maintained in a fashion which would allow for an estimate of the stamp duty yield from the sales of new residential property to non-owner-occupiers to be provided. The yield from stamp duty for the first four months of this year for all property transactions was £117 million, of which it is estimated that somewhere in the region of £50 million was accounted for by residential property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the Government response to the first Bacon Report on housing, I revised the stamp duty code in the 1998 Finance (No. 2) Act. As well as reducing the rates of stamp duty applying on residential property valued under £500,000, I also changed the rules regarding the application of stamp duty on certain categories of new residential property sales. In general stamp duty does not apply to the sale of new owner-occupier residential property, except where the property is larger than 125 square metres, where stamp duty is levied on one <Col N="892" /> quarter of the aggregate of the site and construction costs.  However, where the purchaser intends using the residential property for reasons other than as their principal private residence, then stamp duty at the normal residential rates apply on the total value of the sale regardless of whether the property has a floor area certificate or not. The reason for this change was to address the imbalance between owner-occupiers and investors in the new housing market. While this measure was introduced with effect from 23 April 1998 transitional arrangements applied until 31 March of this year, which subject to certain conditions being met allowed for the previous stamp duty rules to apply in such transitional cases.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission was notified as long ago as January 1998 of this matter and my Department has discussed it on several occasions since then with the EU Commission. The commission approved last January the capital allowances for this scheme and on 9 February it sent a detailed letter to the Irish authorities raising queries about the double rent and rates reliefs for this scheme. A very detailed and comprehensive reply was sent to the commission on 8 March in response to their 9 February letter.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU procedures the commission published their 9 February letter in the EU official journal on 10 April inviting comments on this matter from the other member states and interested parties by 10 May. A number of interested parties sent in their comments to the commission by the required date and the Irish authorities are awaiting copies of these from the commission. However, on the latest available information, it would appear that all the comments were sent by Irish interested parties. There is to be a meeting in Brussels between my Department and the commission on 28 May to discuss the matter further and it is hoped that this will lead to a speedy resolution of the outstanding issues. I would like to emphasise that this issue has been treated as a top priority by my Department over the last 15 months who have made every endeavour to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion as quickly as possible, and this has been acknowledged and recognised by the Irish interests affected.</P>

      <P>I submitted the interim report of the steering group on systems review of the Department of Agriculture and Food to the Government on 18 May. The work of the steering group continues and I intend to bring its final report to the attention of the Government as soon as possible after it becomes available, with a view to taking appropriate action. In the meanwhile the Government has decided that the Department of Agriculture and Food should examine the interim report and report back to the Government with plans for the implementation of the group's recommendations within six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim report confirmed that the controls, systems and procedures have improved very significantly since the late 1980s and early 1990s and <Col N="894" /> outlined a number of specific ways in which the Department of Agriculture and Food 's performance in the future could be improved.</P>
    <P>It stressed that the Department of Agriculture and Food be particularly conscious of the need for financial and management control and awareness of risk in the area aid scheme. It recommended the need to identify and quantify the risks associated with new  schemes and said efforts should be made to ensure that changes at EU level  take account of the characteristics of the Irish system of agriculture and Irish  administration. It made recommendations that priority be given to a separate study for the development of an information technology strategy. It suggested that resources be made available to the Department's internal audit unit to ensure its capacity to undertake audits of computer systems. It recommended that auditors' recommendations be implemented speedily, particularly those of the internal audit unit. It advised of the need to further develop an integrated human resource management strategy and the implementation of cross-stream team working arrangements. It recommended the strengthening of the internal management services unit. Recommendations were made to examine inspection procedures at plant and farm level which would lead to more widespread use of unannounced inspections with priority given to areas of high risk. It also made suggestions as to the desirability of having legal staff within the Department to deal with the volume of litigation in which it is involved.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food faces many challenges in aligning its systems with the needs of the future and in ensuring a high level of service to its clients in a context of appropriate controls and mechanisms for accountability. This interim report is one step in that process &ndash; I expect that it, together with the final report, will be very useful to the Government and to the Department in setting priorities for the way ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1999 Economic Survey of Ireland notes that the Irish economy has notched up five straight years of stunning economic performance. Output growth has averaged over 9 per cent per year on a GDP basis in the period 1994-98. Half of that growth has been reflected in employment gains and the rest in impressive labour productivity growth. Despite substantial increases in the labour force, thanks to Ireland's favourable demographics and to an important reversal in migration flows, the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly nine percentage points.</P>
      <P>Spending growth has been remarkably well balanced, with export increases in the starring role, ably supported by private investment, and Government spending only playing a bit part. With booming tax receipts, the turnaround in Government finances has continued. There is now a sizeable surplus in its accounts, of about 1.75 per cent of GDP, and the level of Government debt in relation to GDP has shrunk by nearly half, to well below the Maastricht threshold of 60 per cent. Even though consumer price inflation is no longer among the lowest in the OECD, as it was a few years ago, it has remained below 2 per cent, despite the economic boom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> The report points out that there are signs of overheating. It states that labour shortages have moved beyond the realm of specific skills to a more generalised scarcity of even unskilled labour. The most obvious concern is that earnings are now growing more quickly than productivity in a number of sectors. House prices were rising rapidly at least until the latter part of 1998. The form of adjustment to supply constraints that is occurring is that higher wage rates are running ahead of productivity gains and pushing up costs, eroding competitiveness and braking the growth in exports, The risk is that this process could be too rapid, with unrealistic expectations leading to an overshooting of sustainable wage levels and a sharp cost-based slowdown in growth to well below potential rates.</P>
    <P>The OECD forecasts that real GDP growth may ease somewhat and could be below 7 per cent by 2000. The major policy question is how to manage the pressures arising from the rapid expansion so as to ensure that growth is sustained at a high rate.</P>

      <P>My Department formally notified the EU Commission of the business elements of both schemes on 17 September 1998 after having already discussed them with the EU Commission on a number of occasions earlier in the year. The commission responded on 17 November 1998 with a request for a substantial amount of additional information. The matter was discussed with the EU Commission at a meeting in mid-February and a detailed reply was sent to the commission in early March. The commission wrote again on 24 March 1999 with a further request for additional information and a reply was sent to this letter on 24 May 1999. The discussions with the EU Commission have been quite protracted and are affected by the delay in obtaining EU approval for the new regional State aids for various Irish regions, including the new regional aid intensity ceilings. As things stand at present, it appears that it will take some more months before the business tax incentives elements of the schemes will be approved by the EU Commission.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Comsource, which is a consortium comprising KPN and Telia, acquired 20 per cent of Telecom Éireann in 1996. It has an option to purchase a <Col N="898" /> further 15 per cent of the company before the end of 1999. The State has sold and transferred 13.23 per cent of Telecom Éireann to an employee share trust and it is expected that the balance of 1.67 per cent will be transferred at the end of this year when the employees have made further delivery on the change programme in the company. The Deputy will be aware that Telecom Eireann is to be floated shortly. No final decision has been taken on the quantity of shares to be offered to investors.</P>
    <P>Later this year it is planned to sell ICC Bank by way of a trade sale and, in that context, negotiations are ongoing with employee representatives in relation to the possible establishment of an employee shareholding in the bank. ACC Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank are planning to merge. It is intended that the combined the entity will be floated, possibly in 2000, with the proceeds accruing to the Exchequer. The Government has agreed to make provision for an employee stake if arrangements can be agreed with the staff side.</P>
    <P>The State is also seeking a purchaser for its interest in Irish fertilisers industries. An examination of the strategic options for Cóillte is being conducted and consultants have recently been appointed by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to assist with the evaluation of all options.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus recently submitted a report to the Minister for Public Enterprise in relation to a possible strategic partnership for the airline with, or without, an equity dimension. The report also emphasises that Aer Lingus needs access to equity capital markets to help fund future developments. The report is being examined by Ministers. No decision has yet been taken. Aer Lingus already has an employee shareholding of 4 per cent as part of an agreed arrangement for an overall employee holding of 5 per cent. Aer Rianta has also submitted a report to the Minister for Public Enterprise on its future strategic direction. The report, which recommends a flotation to source new capital, is being examined and no decision has yet been taken on the recommendations made by the company.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the concerns which the Deputy has raised and I am aware of the tax burden facing individuals, particularly on the inheritance of the family home. During this year's Finance Bill debate in the Dáil, I undertook that prior to the next budget, I would examine the capital acquisitions tax code in some detail. I want to see if we can come up with a solution that alleviates the tax burden and, at the same time, is fair to all who face similar circumstances in relation to CAT on the domestic residence.</P>
      <P>However, it must be remembered that any changes in the CAT area are costly. The yield from inheritance tax was £77.5 million for 1998. This revenue greatly assists the Government's programme and helps achieve the ongoing goal of reducing the tax take on employment incomes. For this reason, any significant changes to the CAT must be considered in a budgetary context when choices have to be made on which elements of the tax system to address.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme is to improve the quality of life of certain disabled persons, through enhancing their overall mobility in a manner consistent with not imposing an unreasonable burden on Exchequer resources. The scheme targets what are costly reliefs at those who are severely and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility.</P>
      <P>The current scheme had its origins in section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968 which introduced an exemption from the payment of road tax on vehicles specially adapted or constructed for and used by disabled persons who, in the main, would have been confined to wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>The initial scheme was extended on a number of occasions and a new consolidated scheme of reliefs was provided for under section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989. That section enabled the Minister for Finance to make regulations providing for the refund on road tax, excise duty, later Vehicle Registration Tax, and VAT on the purchase of a vehicle used by certain disabled persons and for the repayment of the excise duty on petrol or diesel used in the vehicle. The resultant Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989 came into effect on 21 December 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions of the scheme was carried out in 1993-94, involving wide ranging consultations with the Departments of Health, the Environment and Justice, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, relevant organisations catering for the disabled and opposition spokespersons for Finance. In the course of the review detailed consideration was given to the qualifying medical criteria for entry to the scheme, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to many <Col N="904" /> additional categories of disabled individuals. It was decided that the scheme should continue to focus on persons with the most severe mobility restrictions. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations, drawn up following that review, and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. It is the nature and the extent of the disability which determines a person's eligibility under the scheme rather than the circumstances which have given rise to that disability. The current regulations, namely the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations came into effect on 1 December 1994.</P>
    <P>I must confirm to the Deputy that I have no role in determining whether or not a person satisfies the medical criteria laid down in the above mentioned regulations. That is a matter of judgment on the part of the senior area medical officer in the local health board. Where the issue of such a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.</P>

      <P>Provision for the designation by order of areas immediately adjacent to seven regional airports, including Knock Airport, as enterprise areas is contained in section 340 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The designation order may be made by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise and following receipt of a proposal from or on behalf of a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations.</P>
      <P>Qualifying trading operations are (a) manufacturing activities which qualify under the Finance Acts for 10 per cent corporation tax and (b) internationally traded service activities excluding financial services. I have made provisions under section 44 of the Finance Act, 1999 for the inclusion of freight forwarding and logistical services as qualifying trading operations subject to EU Commission approval. Companies must also have been approved for financial assistance by the State industrial development agencies &ndash; Forfás, Enterprise Ireland, Údarás na Gaeltachta and IDA Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation covering the scheme is contained in chapter three of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. The tax reliefs for the airport enterprise areas are capital allowances of up to <Col N="905" /> 100 per cent on expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of premises used by qualifying companies. Initially, a double rent allowance for ten years was available for the lessees of such premises. However, the EU Commission has informed my Department of their intention of not approving double rent allowance in the event of our notification of an enterprise area adjacent to a regional airport. Section 44 of the 1999 Finance Act accordingly amended the legislation to provide that no double rent allowance will be available for airport enterprise areas. However, the year one capital allowance for lessors is increased from 25 per cent to 50 per cent for qualifying expenditure incurred since 1 January 1998 in the airport enterprise areas.</P>
    <P>The designation of the regional airport areas depends on specific projects being proposed for each area. When such projects come forward and are approved by the relevant authorities, the individual enterprise area schemes will be submitted to the EU Commission for its approval. It should be noted that under the commission's decision, the provisions for all of the enterprise areas covered by the 1997 Finance Act will have to terminate on 31 December 1999 instead of 30 June 2000. To date, no qualifying proposal from or on behalf of a company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations adjacent to Knock Airport has been submitted to me.</P>

      <P>The national millennium committee is to examine and make recommendations on projects of national significance for inclusion in the Government's millennium programme and also to recommend a system for supporting locally based millennium projects.</P>
      <P>With regard to the latter and in response to the large number of locally based projects received, there will be a total of £2 million, 2.539 million euros, of millennium funding for a millennium recognition awards initiative. This initiative will be administered by Area Development Limited on behalf of the national millennium committee. Full details of the awards will be announced shortly and newspaper advertisements will be placed inviting applications.</P>
      <P>Having considered the Bray Millennium Jazz Festival proposal, the national millennium committee's view was that this project would be more appropriate for consideration under the millennium recognition awards initiative. Accordingly, arrangements are being made to have an application form and details of the awards sent to the organisers.</P>

      <P>My Department's Estimate, Vote 3, contains funding of £32.233 million for 1999, including £8.16 million for the administration costs of the Department and £24.073 million for programme expenditure.</P>
      <P>The administrative budget, subheads A1 to A7, covers salaries, travel costs, incidental expenses, including official entertainment, state entertainment, training, GIS expenses, advertising, gifts, and other miscellaneous expenses, postal and telecommunications costs, office equipment and supplies, office premises expenses and consultancy costs.</P>
      <P>Under the programme Subheads in the Vote for 1999, the following bodies under the aegis of the Department are funded: the Information Society Commission &ndash; £550,000; the National Partnership Centre &ndash; £415,000; the All Party Committee on the Constitution &ndash; £250,000; the All Party Committee on SMI &ndash; £60,000; the National Economic and Social Council &ndash; Grant-in-Aid £464,000; the National Economic and Social Forum &ndash; Grant-in-Aid £464,000; the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation &ndash; £80,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Vote contains the following provisions: £1 million and £4.65 million respectively for the McCracken and Moriarty Tribunals; £45,000 for matching funding for the Territorial Employment Pacts, which are co-financed by the EU; £800,000 for grants under the Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988; £400,000 for Commemoration Initiatives; £14.9 million for Millennium Celebrations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that £343,762 has previously been allocated to three separate projects, and a further £1.2 million is now to be allocated to a further 59 projects, involving North South and East West co-operation or relating to the island of Ireland. This funding will be allocated from subhead C, Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Act, 1988, and subhead E, Commemoration Initiatives, of the Vote. Expenditure on the millennium celebrations is administered by my Department, through the National Millennium Committee which was established towards the end of 1998. The secretariat to the committee is provided by a small millennium office, located within my Department, which is also responsible for co-ordinating the Government's overall millennium programme.</P>
      <P>All of the funding outlined above is specifically identified in the 1999 Estimate for my Department.</P>

      <P>The review of State regional ports and harbours being undertaken by KPMG Consulting for my Department is nearing completion. A development plan for the harbour, with a total estimated cost of some £3.3 million, was commissioned by the Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Commissioners some years ago and was submitted to my Department for consideration. In relation to any future development of the harbour I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the consultancy review which will address this and other issues. The development requirements for the harbour will also be assessed in the context of the overall priorities for coastal infrastructure development and in light of available funding under the national plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>The vessels known as beamers fish using beam trawl nets, in accordance with sea-fishing boat licences granted pursuant to section 222B, as amended, of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959. Certain of the licences in question, which were granted over a period of years as vessels entered the fleet, contain restrictions on the amount of time which may be spent fishing by means of beam trawls, and/or on the locations where the vessels may fish. EU fisheries law also regulates the activities of such vessels.</P>
      <P>I have received complaints that fishing by means of beam trawls is causing damage to some fishing grounds. I intend to meet representatives of the various interests in the matter shortly, to discuss the issues involved.</P>

Beyond that, and pending the establishment of the Body and the north-south Ministerial Council, it would not be appropriate to comment on the detail of the work programme.</P>

      <P>All clerical staff up to higher executive officer level at the Departments offices in Dublin and Cork participate in flexible working arrangements within the hours of 8.30 a.m. and 6.30 p.m. The question of extending flexible working hours to agencies established under the auspices of the Department is kept under review. Because of the small size of most of our missions abroad, there is limited scope for applying those arrangements. However, it is proposed to extend the facility to clerical staff working at the London embassy later this year.</P>

      <P>Aid, irrespective of its form, is<i> prima facie</i> State aid once it is funded by the Exchequer.

The legislation referred to is applied in the interests of all herdowners whose co-operation is necessary for the smooth running of the various programmes run under the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes. The interests of herdowners are represented by <Col N="929" /> the various farm bodies who meet regularly in the animal health forum.</P>
      <P>The animal health forum was established in 1996 as part of the new arrangements agreed for the administration of the disease eradication schemes and comprises senior representatives of the farming and veterinary organisations together with the Departments of Finance and Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>The forum's central focus is to advise and make recommendations to the Minister on the operation of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes, to discuss the existing arrangements and to review progress.</P>

      <P>As I have made apparent in my contributions during the debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas on the passage of the Bretton Woods (Agreements) (Amendment) Act, 1999, the HIPCs debt initiative is a major step forward, but needs to be substantially improved.</P>
      <P>I believe that debt relief should be closely linked to the goals of sustainable development and poverty reduction, and that there is a broad consensus growing up at European Union level now in favour of this position. It is clear to me that the underlying programmes for HIPC should focus on high quality growth aiming at improving the situation of the poor and reflect social concerns by protecting social expenditures. In this context, notwithstanding the remarkable achievements so far and the large degree of flexibility applied, the HIPC initiative has been criticised, in particular by NGO'S, as providing too little debt relief too late. In response, several EU member states, including Ireland, have made proposals for changes in the HIPC debt initiative for debt relief to be deeper, to cover more countries and to be provided earlier. These proposals focus on the following areas; the timing of debt relief; the definition of indicators for sustainability; the extent of Paris Club debt cancellation on commercial debt; the extent of ODA debt cancellation the need for an appropriate financing and burden sharing.</P>
      <P>These proposals, of course, have important implications for the financing of the HIPC initiative, in particular since even in its current framework the initiative is not fully financed.</P>
      <P>The precise modalities for contributions by the various international institutions are set out on the internet websites of the World Bank and IMF. Their availability reflects a new climate of openness and transparency on the part of both of these institutions. The relevant Internet addresses are:</P>

    <P>The Deputy will wish to be aware of the major review of the HIPC initiative, which is currently under way. My own Department has already made a submission to the first stage of the review process and are currently preparing our submission to the second stage. I have also invited Axel Van Trotsenburg, the senior World Bank official in charge of the review process, to visit Ireland in June. He will have consultations with my Department, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and with interested NG0s. I believe that this visit will offer all of us a unique opportunity to have a positive effect upon the future course of the debt relief process.</P>
    <P>Overall, I believe that there is cause for hope that the process of debt relief may be improved and accelerated in the near future. Our belief that the process must become formally linked to the implementation of antipoverty and social development measures in the indebted countries is also gaining ground. We intend, therefore, to take maximum advantage of the opportunity presented by the current review process.</P>

      <P>These figures are based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism which covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries. It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on other income of employees such as rent and other investment income. It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>

In general, these restrictions are set out in the contracts in two ways.</P>
      <P>First, all temporary staff are expressly reminded in their contracts that the terms of the Official Secrets Act, 1963 apply to them. This Act requires that all official information must be treated as confidential, unless it is specifically exempted under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. This legal requirement to uphold the confidentiality of such information applies both during and after the period of employment.</P>
      <P>Second, the contracts of temporary staff contain more specific provisions which preclude the employees, both during and subsequent to their official appointment, from communicating to third parties official information acquired in the course of their duties. In some cases this commitment specifically includes a prohibition on the disclosure of confidential information with commercial potential. In addition, some contracts, and in particular those signed by temporary private office appointees, contain certain restrictions on the publication of books and articles.</P>

      <P>The percentage of national lottery funded expenditure which was spent on youth, sport, recreation and amenities in 1998 was almost 36 per cent. The allocation for 1999 is almost 37 per cent and represents the highest percentage allocated to this particular beneficiary category since 1991.</P>
      <P>There is no fixed percentage applying to any of the categories in any given year. Allocations are made on an annual basis in conjunction with the spending Departments' Estimates for that year. The areas of youth and sport have benefited greatly from allocations of lottery money and I do not envisage any change to the methods used in its distribution.</P>

This does not apply in the case of TSB or any of the State companies such as ACC or ICC. The proceeds from the sale of the TSB and public assets will accrue to the Exchequer. However, subject to confirmation that there are no problems in relation to domestic or EU legal requirements, I am prepared to reserve a specific number of shares at the offer price for long standing customers of ACC-TSB when floated on the stock exchange. I expect to appoint advisers shortly in relation to the flotation process and the question of an allotment of shares at the offer price to long standing customers is one of the issues that will be examined in detail by these advisers.</P>

      <P>To fully address this question it is necessary to hypothesise, first, about the rate at which sterling would have entered EMU on 1 January 1999, and second, the impact of the UK's participation in EMU on euro-zone monetary policy. As these two hypothetical questions are virtually impossible to answer, it is not possible to assess the impact to date on the Irish economy of the UK remaining outside EMU.</P>
      <P>The chief concern about UK non-participation has always been the potential impact on the Irish economy of sudden changes in the value of sterling. As highlighted in the ESRI study on EMU, a large fall in the value of sterling would adversely affect the competitiveness of Irish exporters whilst an appreciation of sterling against the euro would, all things being equal, lead to higher prices in Ireland. This has not been the experience to date.</P>
      <P>Since the start of EMU the euro has fallen by about 6 per cent against sterling. This will improve the competitiveness of Irish exporters in the UK. However, it will also, if sustained, increase import prices and put upward pressure on inflation in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The 1999 Finance Act did not alter the taxation treatment of credit unions. I have made clear the position in relation to the tax treatment of credit unions savings on a number of occasions. I also set up a working group to examine this matter in conjunction with the Irish League of Credit Unions. Their report was presented to me last October and earlier this year I made the report publicly available.</P>
      <P>It is clear from reading that report that this matter is a complex issue and that there are a number of issues to be considered before any decision can be taken. Not least, there is the EU dimension which must be carefully examined. While the EU Commission decided not to regard the corporation tax exemption enjoyed by credit unions as a State aid, one consideration, I believe, which influenced their decision is the fact that the dividends paid out of such income are liable to income tax in the hands of the credit union members themselves. This benign attitude of the commission to the corporation tax exemption could change if we were to exempt dividends from income tax. This is a point which should not be overlooked by those now seeking an exemption of credit union dividends from income tax. As I am sure the Deputy knows I continued the corporation tax exemption in the 1998 Finance Act.</P>
      <P>As I indicated recently, in this House, I am still considering the position of credit unions but as yet have no proposals in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 124 and 125 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its meeting yesterday &ndash; 25 May 1999 &ndash; the Government approved the text of a draft order providing for the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to investigate the infection with HIV and <Col N="937" /> hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia. The main issues to be examined by the tribunal are as follows; which products caused, or probably caused, the infection; the role of the Blood Transfusion Service Board (BTSB), medical consultants and others in product selection; the prevailing state of medical and scientific knowledge; implementation of self sufficiency policy by BTSB;selection procedures with regard to manufacturers and fractionators; donor selection; donor testing; donor screening; plasma quarantine criteria; viral inactivation procedures; follow-up measures in respect of tracing, offering testing and minimising risk of infection; response to discovery that persons had been infected; role of the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB); supervision of NDAB and BTSB by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will also investigate the circumstances of the infection with HIV of the person known as &ldquo;the Kilkenny health worker&rdquo; following a blood transfusion in July 1985 and the circumstances surrounding the issue of untested platelet concentrate in December 1985, the donor of which was subsequently diagnosed as HIV positive.</P>
    <P>Because of the special position held by the Irish Haemophilia Society in that it represents persons directly affected by the HIV and hepatitis C contamination of blood products, my officials and I have been in consultation with the society in relation to the issues to be examined by the tribunal. It appears that most blood products implicated in the infection of haemophiliacs with hepatitis C and HIV were manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in the USA, some based on blood donated there and some based on blood donated in Ireland and sent for processing. In order to fully investigate the source of the infections, therefore, the IHS felt that the tribunal should, if possible, inquire into the relevant operations of the pharmaceutical companies concerned.</P>
    <P>The proposed terms of reference include a provision which would enable the tribunal to investigate anything arising outside the State that it considers relevant in so far as the tribunal considers it practicable, appropriate and reasonable to do so and considers that the procedures adopted for the purpose can be carried out without unduly delaying the completion of the inquiry and with a substantial expectation of being able to obtain the evidence necessary for the investigation.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General and I met representatives of the society and its legal advisers on Friday, 21 May. At that meeting, the IHS indicated that they were satisfied that the proposed terms of reference comprised all the issues which they wish to have examined by the tribunal. The IHS also indicated their support for the provision relating to the international aspect of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>At yesterday's meeting, the Government also approved the moving of the necessary motion in the Dáil and Seanad to establish the tribunal. I will be making arrangements for the moving of <Col N="938" /> the motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>I presume this question relates to whether the new community allowance for community psychiatric nurses should be passed on to pensioners in lieu of the allowances held by them at retirement. My Department has consulted with the Department of Finance in the matter and has been informed that the community allowance represents a significant increase on the former allowances it replaces. The increase was negotiated as part of a specific deal for community psychiatric nurses. In other PCW or similar deals where existing allowances were made pensionable, this benefit was not extended to pensioners who retired before the effective date of the agreement. In line with this approach, my Department has been advised that the community allowance should not be applied to pensioners who retired before its introduction. These pensioners, however, will continue to benefit from the pensionable allowances they held at retirement, uprated by pay increases, in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the organisation and management of the national blood transfusion service rests with the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Following the report of the Finlay tribunal of inquiry, the BTSB is implementing a wide ranging programme of modernisation in order to adapt to emerging developments in transfusion medicine. A number of measures to further improve blood safety are being introduced this year at a cost of approximately £6.8 million. This has resulted in a unit price increase in red cells from £63 to £94. A new IT system is also being introduced at a cost of approximately £4 million. At the Cork centre, the BTSB recently completed <Col N="939" /> the refurbishment of the components processing and compatibility testing laboratory at a cost of over £500,000.</P>
      <P>Transfusion medicine is undergoing rapid change. New technologies and additional safety tests continue to emerge. The BTSB is continually assessing these developments to ensure that its practices are in line with best international standards consistent with efficiency and effectiveness. One such development is PCR testing which is being introduced on the advice of the medical consultants at the board following an evaluation of international best practice. PCR testing is the most sensitive way of detecting viruses in blood donations and requires high grade laboratories, expensive technology and expert technical support.</P>
      <P>In February 1998, the board of the BTSB decided that, having regard to international practice, PCR testing at both the Dublin and Cork centres could not be justified. It was decided, therefore, that PCR testing for all donations would be carried out in the new national headquarters which is currently under construction. The implementation of this decision will involve testing blood samples from donations collected in all parts of the country at the new national headquarters. The proposal which is now being assessed by the BTSB is whether all serological testing, and not just PCR testing, should be performed at the national headquarters. The board of the BTSB has asked the chief executive officer and the national medical director to prepare a report on the practical implications for patient services of developing a single site for donation testing in Ireland. Among the issues being addressed are: how best to provide a transfusion service in the light of the rapidly changing environment in transfusion medicine; the application of accepted international standards of practice in leading centres and blood services; the achievement of the goal of supplying 100 per cent of blood components on time and without fail; the likelihood of a substantial reduction in the use of blood components given the alternatives to blood transfusion which are currently available on being developed; the concerns of health boards and hospitals, including their concerns about the substantial increase in the costs of BTSB products; the achievement of a service that is efficient and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of this process, the chief executive officer and the national medical director of the BTSB are consulting with international transfusion experts. Consultation is also taking place with BTSB staff, relevant hospitals and blood users to brief them on the emerging developments, fully explain the BTSB's enhanced blood safety programme and address the needs <Col N="940" /> and concerns of medical and scientific staff. A meeting has already taken place with members and staff of the Southern Health Board. The BTSB has advised the Southern Health Board that the BTSB is committed to working with all hospitals to ensure that it meets their blood component needs in a speedy, efficient and cost-effective manner consistent with the essential requirement of blood safety. The BTSB has invited scientific and medical input from hospital consultants in Cork to inform its considerations. The newly appointed chairman of the BTSB has also offered an opportunity to the Southern Health Board to make a presentation. The board of the BTSB will consider the outcome of the current assessment at its meeting in July.</P>
    <P>In response to a number of misleading statements that have appeared in the media recently, I want to assure the Deputy that the closure of the BTSB Cork centre is not on the agenda of the BTSB or my Department. All that is being considered is a possible change in one aspect of the Cork operation. There is no suggestion of any change in relation to the other scientific and technical services currently carried out at the Cork centre, such as blood grouping, components processing, compatibility testing and ante-natal screening.</P>
    <P>With regard to claims that patients' lives will be put at risk as a result of the proposed changes in the BTSB Cork centre, the BTSB say that there is no evidence to suggest that life-saving operations in hospitals throughout the country would be affected by having one national testing centre. The BTSB point out that there are many acute hospitals in the country that are a considerable distance from a blood testing centre and this, of itself, does not pose a threat to patient safety. It has been suggested that the removal of testing operations from the Cork centre would delay the supply of blood components to hospitals in the region. The BTSB reject this and point out that, at any given time, 75 per cent of blood stocks are held by hospitals, with the remainder being stocked at the BTSB facilities in Cork and Dublin. There is no proposal to change this policy.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to extensive replies which I gave to the House in response to questions on 22 April 1999 in relation to this product.</P>
      <P>This product has been the subject of a product authorisation since 1983 and, as with all medicinal products, was subject to ongoing review by the former National Drugs Advisory Board. As I previously explained, a full review of the relative safety and efficacy of this product was carried out by the newly established Irish Medicines Board as part of the assessment of the renewal of the authorisation in 1998 and also as a result of information regarding the development of neuropsychiatric reactions, including depression, suicide and suicide ideation, reported in connection with the use of the product.</P>
      <P>As a result of this review, the prescribing data and patient information leaflets were amended in 1998 to reflect the latest information becoming available in relation to possible side effects associated with the product, including possible neuropsychiatric reactions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As recommended in the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, regional co-ordinating committees for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities have been set up in each health board area. These bring together health boards, voluntary sector service providers and consumers. One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committee is to advise on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services. This year £3 million, £6 million full year cost in the year 2000, has been provided for the development of services. The allocation of funding out of this for the provision of clinics to <Col N="943" /> provide advice, counselling and information to people with epilepsy, their families and their carers must be considered by each board in consultation with its co-ordinating committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme will replace the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme, with effect from 1 July 1999. Services to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme will not change.</P>
      <P>The new drug payment scheme will effectively merge the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. Many families and individuals have very heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and have to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter before they receive a refund. This can cause considerable cash flow problems for a significant number of families and individuals. This will not happen under the new drug payment scheme. From the introduction of the new scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines. It means that families and individuals will, for the first time, be able to budget for the cost of medicines. Families and individuals will know that, whatever the size of their drugs bill, they will not have to pay more than £42 per month. In addition, there are families where, although one member may qualify for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card, combined expenditure on medicines by other members, which can be considerable, cannot be recouped until the end of the quarter. With the new drug payment scheme, no family will have to pay more than £42 in any month for prescribed medicines. The new scheme will be of significant benefit to such families.</P>
      <P>The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the current drug refund scheme. Under the drug refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example, in one month have expenditure of say £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion in the new drug payment scheme. Where expendi<Col N="944" /> ture by a family or an individual exceeds £42 per month on prescribed medicines, the balance will be met by the State. This is in contrast to the old drug cost subsidisation scheme where patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new scheme will be easier to use than the drug refund scheme and will be more inclusive than the drug cost subsidisation scheme, bringing overall benefits to a greater number of people.</P>

    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): Orthodontic services are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for a consultant-led orthodontic service in each health board. Dental teams provide services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant. The consultant-led service ensures a high quality of service and high service levels. Additional resources have been made available by my Department to the health boards including the Mid-Western Health Board over the past few years to enable the health boards to develop their orthodontic services in accordance with the action plan.</P>
    <P>The provision of orthodontic services and the recruitment of orthodontic staff in the Mid-Western Health Board area is the statutory responsibility of the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>I have had inquiries made of the Mid-Western Health Board. I understand that the approved staff complement for the orthodontic department is one consultant orthodontist and 6.5 dental surgeons &ndash; wholetime equivalents, WTEs. At present the posts of consultant orthodontist and 5.1, WTEs, dental surgeons are filled including 0.5 WTEs on long-term sick leave. The board is currently assessing what action should be taken in relation to the filling of the vacant posts.</P>

      <P>The availability of flexible working hours within my Department is already in place for grades up to and including higher executive officer and administrative officer. The number of hours allowed for carry-over into a subsequent flexi period has recently been extended from eight hours to 11.5 hours, with union agreement, increasing the amount of flexi leave from one day to 1.5 days per four-week period. The Department is always available for further discussions through the forum of General Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health service employers i.e. health boards, public voluntary hospitals and mental handicap agencies are committed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. At present, the only options for permanent employment are full-time work or job-sharing. The absence of more flexible attendance patterns has been identified as a major obstacle to attracting nurses and midwives with family responsibilities back to work. The Health Services Employers Agency, as the representative body for all publicly funded health service employers, recently circulated a discussion document on a revised scheme of working arrangements and will shortly be meeting the nursing <Col N="946" /> unions in relation to the proposals contained in the document. This initiative is being undertaken as part of the programme for partnership. Discussions with other health service unions may be held pending the outcome of the initiative relating to nursing staff.</P>

      <P>My Department has been involved in discussions for some time with representatives of the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association with a view to securing a voluntary agreement for the reduction of phosphates in household detergents. In the context of these discussions, the major producers of such products <Col N="947" /> for the Irish market have individually given specific commitments to reduce the p-content of their product ranges and have already extended its ranges of p-free products on the market. One of the major producers has, in recent times, accelerated their programme of phosphorous substitution and indicated an intention to switch all its detergents products to p-free format by mid-2000. On the basis of these developments, it is estimated that the phosphorous load from detergents will be reduced by some 50 per cent by mid-2000 with further reductions thereafter.</P>
      <P>I will support these developments by means of environmental awareness measures later this year to inform and promote consumer preference in favour of p-free products. I intend also to introduce a statutory requirement for the provision of information by producers of detergents to enable the planned reductions in phosphorous to be reliably monitored.</P>
      <P>While a formal, industry-wide agreement is not now feasible, given the differences in the positions of major players, I welcome the progress being made by the industry. I will continue to monitor the position and to seek to secure steady progress towards a more complete phase-out of phosphorous-based detergents.</P>

Detailed guidelines for the proposed scheme are currently being examined with the assistance of an expert advisory panel. These guidelines will be finalised and issued to county councils over the next few weeks. County councils will be asked to consider which towns can benefit from the proposed scheme and to submit plans to my Department in accordance with the terms of the guidelines.</P>

      <P>A scheme of flexible working hours has been in operation in my Department for a number of years. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide a more flexible system of attendance for staff. This scheme is <Col N="951" /> available to staff from clerical officer to higher executive officer level inclusive. The scheme is not available to staff at assistant principal level or above and there are no immediate plans to extend it to these grades. Currently about 2,700 staff are availing of the scheme.  In addition, my Department is participating for the second year in the term time pilot for civil servants. This scheme provides for unpaid leave for the purpose of allowing working parents or primary carers to match their working arrangements to the main school summer holiday period of their children or to care for a person who resides with them and who has a disability of such nature as to give rise to the need for care on a continuing or frequent basis.</P>
      <P>In the Pensions Board a scheme of flexible working hours is available to staff up to and including higher executive officer. The Combat Poverty Agency is currently operating a pilot scheme of flexible working hours. The National Social Services Board does not operate a formal scheme of flexible working hours.</P>

      <P>The review of the free schemes is examining the objectives of these schemes and whether these are being achieved in the most effective and efficient manner. The review will include an examination of the eligibility conditions for the various schemes including the position of single people.</P>
      <P>The review is being carried out by an official of the Department on secondment, as a visiting research fellow at the policy institute, Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The research conducted will be published in the &ldquo;Trinity Studies in Public Policy&rdquo; series. It is expected that the review will be published by the Policy Institute in October/November 1999.</P>
      <P>The living alone allowance, which is not within the scope of the frees review, is a weekly payment for people receiving certain payments from this Department who are aged 66 years or over and who are living alone. The purpose of the allowance is to recognise the extra costs faced by an older person living alone. Any plans to extend this allowance to people other than pensioners would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>when a report which deemed a location (details supplied) to be categorised as souterrain was drafted; the evidence available to her professional staff for this categorisation; the date on which this location was categorised; if this categorisation has, in effect, sterilised the ground involved developmentally as a consequence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>This site was categorised as a souterrain on the basis of its depiction in the first edition ordnance survey map of 1838. Such cartographic evidence was one of the primary sources used in the compilation of a paper survey known as the sites and monuments record, which was completed for County Mayo in 1991.</P>
      <P>The sites and monuments record has since been subsumed into the statutory record of monuments and places for County Mayo published on 24 April 1997 under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>In publishing the record of monuments and places regard was had to all updated information available to my Department including information generated by ongoing field inspections and confirmation on the sites originally identified in the sites and monuments record. This particular souterrain site was inspected on 9 April 1997 and was found to have been built upon. Nevertheless the categorisation and inclusion in the record of monuments and places has not been removed as there is a strong likelihood that sub-surface archaeological features still remain intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The categorisation of this site as a souterrain does not necessarily prohibit development. Inclusion in the record of monument and places imposes a requirement on any persons carrying out works, which have the potential to impinge on a monument site, to give Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department two months written notice of their intentions. Where such notice is received Dúchas will examine the proposals and <Col N="953" /> will arrive at an informed opinion taking into account all the information available including any archaeological impact assessments that may have been prepared.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to sexual abuse cases which require the use of video link facilities. I am informed that the average delay in bringing such cases, from the date of return of trial, before the Central Criminal Court is 11 months and before the Circuit Criminal Court is 12 months. I am also informed that there are three video link cases where for a variety of reasons such as pending judicial review, trial dates in the Central Criminal Court have not yet been fixed.</P>
      <P>Currently the Four Courts is the only venue with video link facilities and consequently all such trials are heard there. A second set of video link equipment was installed in the Four Courts in November 1998 to cater for the increase in the volume of cases requiring these facilities. It is expected that the operation of this second system will reduce the waiting time for hearing video link trials. Also, consideration is being given to the installation of video link facilities at venues outside of Dublin to reduce the number of such trials being transferred to Dublin.</P>
      <P>It must be pointed out that there are factors outside the control of the courts which may contribute to delays in the hearing of any particular case. I must also emphasise that the ordering of the business of the courts is a matter for the courts and I, as Minister, have no function in the matter. Indeed, as the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, it would not be proper for me to comment on the conduct of any individual court case.</P>

      <P>The governor of Cork Prison has confirmed to me that the warrants in question were executed on 27 January 1999. However, regrettably, this was done without the knowledge of the person referred to by the Deputy while that person was on remand on another charge. Since the period on remand exceeded the maximum term of imprisonment &ndash; 14 days &ndash; set out in the executed warrants, the person did not serve any extra period in custody on foot of those warrants.</P>
      <P>Procedures and practices in the general office in the prison have since been reviewed and a routine is now in place which ensures that all warrants are brought to the attention of offenders.</P>

      <P>In accordance with normal Civil Service procedures in this regard, a system of flexible working hours is available in my Department and in a number of offices under its auspices. The question of the further introduction or extension of flexible working hours is one which is reviewed periodically having particular regard to any requests from office managers and staff.</P>
      <P>The following is the position in each of the areas mentioned: in so far as the courts are concerned, the Department considers requests for introduction/expansion of flexible working hours in accordance with general council reports under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. The introduction or expansion of flexible working hours is, of course, subject to the approval of local management.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of work involved and the rostering arrangements in place, there are no plans to introduce flexi-time in the prison service.</P>
      <P>A system of flexible working hours is available to most of the staff in the land registry and registry of deeds. The situation is kept under regular review.</P>
      <P>A system of flexible working hours is available in some offices of the probation and welfare service. No request has been made for an extension of the system, but the matter is kept under review.</P>
      <P>A system of flexible working hours is currently available for staff employed in the head office of the legal aid board. I understand that there are no proposals at present to increase the availability of flexible working hours within the board. A system of flexible working hours is available in the agency.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to introduce a scheme of flexible working hours in An Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Any extension of the availability of flexible working hours in my Department would be influenced by the costs involved and the number of staff at the location in question. A major consideration for my Department is the geographical spread of its offices throughout the country, many of which have a small allocation of staff. The feasibility of introducing flexible working hours to these offices would also have to take into account the need to provide an adequate service to the public.</P>

      <P>My Department is not in a position to verify the identity of applicants. The Department's photo identity card is not intended as an authoritative identification. It is a means of identifying applicants who have applied for asylum and who are registered accordingly. The issue of bank requirements concerning identity is a matter for the bank.</P>

    <P>I might add that my Department administers a scheme of awards for exceptional performance. In accordance with the provisions of the administrative budget agreement <i>ex-gratia </i>payments may be made by management in recognition of exceptional performance by members of staff. The fund is comprised of 0.1 per cent of the salaries element of Vote 19 subheads A1, A9 and A10 which amounts to £13,495 for 1999. Two group payments of £235.35 and £200 respectively have been made to date in 1999.</P>

      <P>Funds provided in the 1999 Estimate for my Department are all allocated to specific subheads, expenditure from within a number of which are subject to specific ministerial approval.</P>
      <P>Such subheads include subhead C.1 which relates to grant-in-aid for general expenses of sports organisations and other expenditure in relation to sports activities, and subheads C.2 and C.3 which relate to the provision of grant assistance towards recreational and major sports facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allocations to sports organisations from C.1 are decided on the basis of recommendations made to my Department by the Irish Sports Council which considers applications in the first instance. The council's recommendations are based on a close and detailed evaluation of applications and are made having regard to criteria for grant approval outlined in my Department's <Col N="961" /> section 15 and 16 reference book prepared under the Freedom of Information Act 1997.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 501 on Tuesday, 20 April last, allocations for 1999 have yet to be finalised for a number of bodies including the OCI, the NCTC and to the sports governing bodies under the international carding scheme in respect of high-performing sportspersons. Amounts awarded up to end April to bodies and groups from subhead C.1 are set out in the attached schedule.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, almost 1,900 applications are currently under consideration for grant assistance from subhead C.1 and C.3 which together go to make up the 1999 sports capital programme, allocations to be made in accordance with the criteria set out in the term and conditions of that programme. In view of the large number of applications received, and the level of work involved in evaluating them, I do not expect to be in a position to make final announcements on the 1999 round of sports capital allocations for some time yet.</P>
    <P>On the tourism side, subhead B.4 provides for tourism marketing initiatives. The purpose of this subhead is to facilitate specific projects or events with clear associated tourism marketing benefits, which are not assisted under alternative funding mechanisms such as the operational programme for tourism, 1994-99.</P>
    <P>In 1999 £4.55 million has been provided for subhead B.4. Of this, £2.5 million has already been allocated to Millennium Festivals Limited; £1.05 million to Bord Fáilte for marketing; £0.5 million for the PGA agreement relating to the 2005 Ryder Cup; and the remaining £0.5 million for a special tourism marketing initiative scheme including the tourism sporting ambassador programme, awards from which to date are listed in the following schedule, determined following assessment by my Department in consultation with Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>Ullmhaíodh an Páipéar Uaine i mBéarla ar dtús. Ag féachaint don phráinn a bhain lena fhoilsiú, agus don mhórshaothar a bhainfeadh le Gaeilge a chur ar imleabhar chomh mór leis, ní bheadh sé praiticiúil moill a chur lena eisiú go dtí go mbeadh sé aistrithe. Thosaigh an próiséas comhairleach díreach i ndiaidh a fhoilsithe agus tá sé ar siúl i gcónaí ó shin. Mar chríoch leis an bpróiséas seo, eiseofar Páipéar Bán níos déanaí sa bhliain.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>The Department's policy in the matter of conducting repeat classes and promoting pupils specifies that the primary school curriculum is designed as an eight year course which provides for an infant programme of two years followed by six years in standards from first to sixth. The syllabus for each component of the curriculum is designed to give the greatest possible degree of flexibility in selecting programmes best suited to the individual needs of individual pupils and schools.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, pupils should, as a rule, progress to a higher standard at the end of each school year. It is accepted that there are exceptional situations from time to time which ordain that an individual pupil would benefit from remaining for a second year in a particular grade. However, the Department holds the view that such situations should be minimal, and that under no circumstances should an entire cohort of pupils be retained for a second year.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise that there is no change in my Department's policy in this area. This policy has been set out in various circulars over the years and, in cases where schools are found to be in breach of this policy, steps are initiated to ensure that the practice is discontinued.</P>
      <P>In relation to class sizes at primary level, the Deputy may be aware that I have introduced a new staffing schedule for the 1999/2000 school year which has been structured to ensure that all schools will operate to a maximum class average of 30 pupils. I am committed to implementing further reductions in class sizes over the next number of years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 162 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 1,000 representations have been received from or on behalf of VTOS students so I am very much aware of the importance of <Col N="965" /> equality of treatment in terms of training allowances on various schemes so that participants can make a free choice as to which programme best meets their needs. The House will be aware that the rates of allowances on VTOS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs back to education schemes were equalised in 1998.</P>
    <P>With effect from 26 April 1999, an additional £25 per week is payable to participants on FÁS courses who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme. I am examining how best the situation <i>vis-à-vis </i>VTOS can be addressed. In addition, the terms of VTOS will be reviewed shortly in the context of a consultancy study currently being undertaken with a view to making the scheme more effective in reaching those who are most marginalised.</P>
    <P>It is expected that this study will be completed towards the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the payment of undergraduate tuition fees in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the free fees initiative undergraduate tuition fees are payable to eligible EU nationals who have been resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved full-time third level course at colleges and institutions approved under the initiative. The initiative does not extend to colleges and institutions in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Since 1998-99 Irish students, along with all other EU students who commence courses in Northern Ireland, are asked to contribute up to £1,000 sterling per annum towards tuition fees for undergraduate courses. However, all EU students are eligible for grant assistance towards their undergraduate tuition fees from the UK authorities, subject to the same conditions, including means testing, as apply to UK students. Irish students must apply for assistance to the appropriate education and library boards in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Donegal VEC recently submitted to my Department a number of applications for payment of tuition fees in respect of students attending undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland. The candidates in question are all in receipt of maintenance grants from Donegal VEC but it appears that they did not qualify for grant aid for tuition fees from the appropriate education and library boards as a result of missing the official closing date of 31 December 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently considering these <Col N="966" /> cases in conjunction with the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland and I will let you know the outcome in due course.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children in the primary system assessed as having special needs arising from a disability will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.</P>
      <P>The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of full-time or part-time resource teacher support or child care support, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>I understand that no application for a resource teacher post has been received in my Department from the school in question. However, the school has written to my Department expressing concern regarding difficulties encountered in arranging assessments for pupils. This matter is being investigated at present.</P>
      <P>I have also arranged for my Department's inspectorate to investigate and report on the special educational needs of pupils attending the school, with a view to ensuring that any necessary support is made available.</P>
