      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business I welcome to Dáil Éireann the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Lord Russell Johnston who is here today in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery. On my behalf and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann, I extend to you, Mr. President, a sincere welcome to our country. I hope you will find your visit to Ireland to be interesting, successful and to our mutual benefit.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today shall be No. 11<i>d.</i> ICC Bank Bill, 1999 &ndash; Financial Resolution; No. 4, Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and No. 5, Human Rights Commission Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage to be taken not later than 1.30 p.m. The Order shall not resume thereafter. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 11<i>d. </i>should be decided without debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one proposal to be put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with item No. 11<i>d. </i>agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Dáil will not sit after today until next Tuesday and that the rcently published CSO survey shows that a majority of adults live in fear of crime, can the Taoiseach give a commitment that the policing of the State will be uninterrupted despite the refusal of gardaí to implement PULSE? Can the Taoiseach indicate what is happening today and why the talks with the gardaí did not commence when he knew PULSE was to be introduced in November? I ask the Taoiseach to be aware that there is a risk, because of the uncertainty during this period when gardaí will be using the quill and ink bottle, that court convictions may not stand up. <Col N="970" /> Can the Taoiseach give a commitment regarding the policing of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen is always preaching disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the PULSE negotiations have been quite protracted. She will be aware that recommendations were made previously and that those recommendations were agreed by the Garda representative group and put to their members but that their members rejected them. Discussions have been ongoing and are continuing today. Among the many positive things in the CSO report was the strong support of Irish citizens for the Garda Síochána. That should not be forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House and the people that there will not be a gap in the policing system because of the impasse created by the lack of administrative control of his Department by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is ridiculous and childish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why the talks are beginning only today. It is because of a few radio interviews that the Government is holding talks. Can the Taoiseach give a commitment that policing will continue uninterrupted while the talks are continuing and that all convictions in this period will stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of sufficient public concern for a comprehensive public statement to be made today by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I suggest that the services of the Labour Relations Commission or of the Labour Court should be availed of sooner rather than later because of the widespread public concern about the collapse of industrial relations in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is continuing to do everything possible to resolve this matter. An enormous amount of taxpayers' money has been invested in the PULSE system. It is an excellent system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it not working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will give policing and the protection of citizens an enormous advantage. It is an outstanding system. The technological developments involved in it are outstanding and I hope it will soon be working.</P>
      <P>Negotiations took place and were concluded. Both sides agreed and the recommendations were put and rejected when put to the gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>What did the Taoiseach do then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has continued to do everything possible. To say there was a lack of <Col N="971" /> effort or administration by the Minister is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Today we will discuss the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill. Yesterday I indicated that I would like to see the elections deferred. I do not now wish to have the elections deferred because the Minister has made concessions to the Opposition and to the fishing interests regarding the contentious aspects of this legislation. I am pleased the Minister did that and we will do everything possible to speed the passage of the Bill through both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the start of this session the House was promised the publication of 19 Bills. As yet, 12 of those Bills have not been published. As there are now only ten sitting days left and taking out the final day of the session when the President will address the Oireachtas and budget day we are left with eight if not seven sitting days, will the Taoiseach indicate when the remaining Bills on section A will be published?</P>
      <P>Will they be published before the Dáil rises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are again hearing, as a result of recent court cases, stories of abuse that took place in residential settings. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the inspectorate of child care is adequately resourced? Is it intended to put it on a statutory basis, as was promised originally when the inspectorate was being discussed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there was originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are still looking to see if it is necessary to put it on a statutory basis. The inspector of child care service inquiries Bill established a basis to enable inquiries into child abuse and related issues to be published. It probably will not be necessary, but a final decision has not been made yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A meeting was held on 22 November between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the social partners. Some commitments were made in relation to the publication of item 82 on the Order Paper, which is the Private Security Industry Bill. When will that commitment be honoured? When will we see the Bill? In the interim, what contact arrangements have been put in place with the social partners, as promised at that meeting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. I mentioned this last week. The Bill is to provide for the establishment of a statutory framework for the regulation of the private security industry. Work is in progress in the Department. The heads of the Bill are expected next week. The Bill will be published next year.</P>

      <P>One of the few Bills on the Government's list that was published earlier this year was an intoxicating liquor Bill, which allowed, among other things, for all night drink<Col N="973" /> ing on the eve of the millennium, which I understand was at the behest of the Minister for the millennium, Deputy Seamus Brennan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill disappeared following a backbench revolt and has not been seen since. Now that the House has voted confidence in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, perhaps the Taoiseach might ask the Minister what the situation will be in regard to legislation on intoxicating liquor. Will the country be drinking all night on the millennium&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> My primary objective in bringing forward this Bill is to create a new comprehensive blueprint for the inland fisheries services. Our inland fisheries resource is an invaluable national asset in its own right and in terms of the social and economic benefits it brings to local communities, the regions and the country as a whole. The inclusive management, conservation and development of the resource to the highest standards is the overall policy objective.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to support the delivery of that objective with a forward looking agenda for change reflecting the interests and responsibilities of all concerned. It is a carefully balanced package designed to involve and empower all the interests concerned at local and regional level. It aims to deliver on the widely undisputed need for new directions in the management, organisation and service delivery of the central and regional fisheries boards. Overall the new framework for the boards and the co-operative societies combined with the establishment of the National Salmon Management Commission represent the most significant initiative for the inland fisheries sector in 20 years. The reform of the structures and the setting of new directions reflect the process of change in the public service and local government. Crucially they also reflect the evolution in thinking in recent years about the objectives for inland fisheries development and conservation and recognise the importance of the environment, local development, tourism, heritage and biodiversity.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about realising the full potential of the inland fisheries resource. The framework I am proposing will devolve responsibility to local regions to manage and control their own affairs through the regional fisheries boards, the co-operatives and clubs. It underpins the vital contribution of all local fisheries interests to the development of the resource. The philosophy underlying my approach is firmly based on the principles of devolution, subsidiarity, partnership and quality service delivery.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the substantive provisions of the Bill and the thinking underlying my proposals for change. The Bill provides for clarified and enhanced functions and responsibilities of the central and regional fisheries boards. The need to redefine these roles to achieve clarity of purpose has been obvious for many years and is in the interests of the boards, their committed staff and all who have a stake in inland fisheries. The Central Fisheries Board will have a pivotal national role in policy advice and strategic planning and development of inland fisheries and in providing specialist co-ordination and support services for the regional fisheries boards. It will have explicit responsibility for the co-ordination and delivery of multiannual strategic plans for the resource, the overall supervision of EU and other funding schemes and, in co-operation with Bord Fáilte, the delivery of overseas marketing and promotion strategies for tourism angling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> The role and responsibilities of the Central Fisheries Board are designed to deliver on the national policy dimension of inland fisheries and the efficient delivery of cross-cutting services to ensure optimum resource deployment, accountability and corporate governance. The central and regional fisheries boards collectively employ more than 400 staff and are funded largely through the Exchequer and the European Union to the tune of over £16 million per annum. I have secured in the national development plan £24 million for the development of inland fisheries not just for tourism but also for recreational purposes. This is a significant funding envelope for the period of the plan. The involvement of the new regional fisheries boards, angling clubs and co-operatives in the spending of this capital will be critical to its success. The Bill provides for this. New standards of service delivery, reporting and accountability in line with modern public service norms are provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The functions and roles of the regional fisheries boards are significantly enhanced in the Bill. This marks a radical devolvement of responsibility and decision making to the regions and local fisheries interests. This is the core of the Bill. The boards will have front line responsibility for management, conservation and protection and development of inland fisheries and angling in their regions. They will have a new pivotal role in developing and leading inland fisheries catchment management plans with angling clubs and other interests. This reflects the new thinking about the integrated nature of fisheries with the environment and local activity generally. The new boards will have explicit responsibilities in relation to sustainable development and biodiversity and heritage which reflects the evolution of thinking at national and international level. The boards will be charged with working in a new form of regional co-operation and shared responsibility which reflects the essential shared nature of the resource.</P>
    <P>In line with my objective to achieve the maximum possible degree of local and regional involvement and responsibility I am providing for a new role for the regional fisheries boards in the acquisition and management of State fisheries. Earlier this year I oversaw the transfer of the Moy fishery to the North West Regional Fisheries Board. This was the first practical step towards the new model of subsidiarity which will ensure management of our valuable State fisheries assets is undertaken by those best placed to manage and develop them. I include the long established vibrant network of salmon, trout and coarse angling clubs in that context.</P>
    <P>Overall my proposals in relation to the functions and responsibilities of the central and regional fisheries boards deliver the correct balance between national and regional priorities and crucially will empower the regional fisheries boards, their executives and local fisheries interests with radical and exciting new remits <Col N="980" /> which reflect the latest thinking on sustainability and the catchment approach, responsive and answerable to local priorities and needs.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a revised composition of the central and regional fisheries boards which aims to achieve a more appropriate balance of fisheries and other relevant interests. My proposals on membership were formulated to underpin the new board functions and reinforce the links with other local stakeholders. Critically the proposals are designed to maintain and reflect the local democratic nature of the regional fisheries boards. My proposals continue the system whereby the local fisheries electoral classes elect representatives to the boards in addition to appointment of regionally based members such as farming, aquaculture, community enterprise and other interests.</P>
    <P>Since I published the Bill on 5 November there has generally been a positive response to the overall strategic concept of the Bill, including the clarified functions and roles of the boards. No one seems to disagree that the direction is broadly the right one. There have been concerns however by the regional fisheries boards and fisheries representative organisations about the balance and mix of elected representatives. My proposals are aimed at ensuring rather than diluting local democracy and participation. The current consultative phase, during which I meet and listen to the angling organisations and other constituent interests, is proving to be constructive and informative. I have received written submissions and in recent days we have met representatives from NARA, TAFI and FISSTA.</P>
    <P>My discussions and those of my officials with NARA, TAFI and FISSTA have been cordial and constructive. The representatives have cogently presented their views on further changes which all their members around the regions would like to see in order to copperfasten their role and involvement in the work of the boards. I have agreed in the first instance that the closest liaison and communication will be maintained with the organisations in consulting and discussing amendments in the run up to Committee Stage. We will do this through a tight Committee Stage working groups approach over the coming weeks with each of the interests concerned. This will ensure that the concepts and drafting changes are worked out together.</P>
    <P>Our discussions have already resulted in collective agreement on a number of key improvements to the Bill which I intend to bring forward by way of amendments on Committee Stage. These agreed areas are as follows. We will maintain the present levels of representation for salmon, trout and coarse anglers and life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust on the regional boards. This will ensure the necessary primary focus and balance of interests towards fisheries across the regions. In that context I will also review the level of representation for commercial salmon interests. The chairpersons of the regional boards will be, as <Col N="981" /> hitherto, elected by all board members, in line with the clear preference of boards and the various interests. I will provide for a more flexible approach to achieving the right mix and balance of ministerial appointed sectoral and local interests on the boards. The provision for inland fisheries catchment management plans will be tightened up so as to make more explicit the lead role of boards and local fisheries interests and the consultative roles of other organisations and stakeholders. A specific provision will be introduced which acknowledges and copperfastens in statute the long-standing role of angling clubs in the management and development of their own resource. I have asked the angling organisations to submit their ideas on giving effect to this concept as quickly as possible. We have also collectively agreed on the need to clarify and spell out in the Bill the process whereby the detailed scheme for salmon tags and quotas will be the subject of further full consultations before its introduction. The Bill in this regard is essentially an enabling provision and the tagging scheme will be within the remit of the National Salmon Commission on which all interests will be widely represented. We have also agreed on a number of adjustments to the provisions on the co-operative societies. In line with the clearly expressed preference of co-operative members, we will continue with the existing arrangement whereby share certificate holders elect their own five members to the committees, with one nominated member &ndash; preferably the development officer &ndash; of the regional board staff and one ministerial nominee. The option of making the holding of share certificates compulsory will remain an option which co-operatives can decide on. I will elaborate later on my overall rationale for facilitating the co-ops to realise their full potential in every region.</P>
    <P>These readily agreed improvements will deliver confidence and certainty among anglers about the overall direction and principles of the Bill. My contacts with a variety of organisations and interests since the Bill was published have clarified and focused our thinking. We are working constructively together to address the outstanding issues within the overall framework for positive change and real devolution of power. There has been an ongoing debate for almost 20 years on the need for new directions. The widespread consensus on the need for change certainly informed my decision to bring forward a new framework. The current intensive consultation phase and the positive outcomes of this process underline our collective ability to agree and address specific and important concerns. I remain open to other suggestions which would improve the Bill further. I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a modernised streamlined structure for the Central Fisheries Board, reflecting its pivotal national role and remit and the norms on State boards. The objective is to provide ministerial nominees with the appropriate balance of interests and competencies which <Col N="982" /> will position the board and its executive to deliver on its core mandate. A direct link with the regional boards will be maintained through the nominations of a chairperson and a chief executive of a regional board. Two members will be nominated by the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, reflecting the links between fisheries, the environment and heritage and biodiversity. Three other ministerial nominees with relevant professional or business expertise will contribute a new focus and perspective to the board's work. The central board, as I have already stated, will have clear responsibilities in overall policy advice, planning and promotion and in specialist co-ordination services for the regional boards. The board membership is designed to support and facilitate delivery on that vitally important remit.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions on the trout and coarse fish co-operation societies. The co-op review group report, which is available on request, made a series of wide ranging recommendations for change. It is clear now that a majority would prefer to continue the existing structures and as I outlined earlier, I am happy to respect their view. There will be a streamlined funding and accounting mechanism which will channel matching Exchequer funding for co-operative projects through the regional boards. This will facilitate better administration and accountability. It will also help to integrate the co-ops more closely with the mainstream of regional fisheries development.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the setting up of the Salmon Management Commission on a statutory basis, in line with the recommendations of the task force. The Commission will advise on salmon management policy and strategies and will take forward the detailed work on the salmon tagging scheme. The commission will have 16 members nominated by all the relevant organisations and four other nominees. I am pleased the angling organisations have already sent in their nominations for the commission and I look forward to shortly confirming all other nominations from the drift, draft and other salmon netting interests. The commission will maintain and facilitate consensus on future national salmon strategies. This new consultative and advisory forum will directly complement and support the work of the central and regional fisheries boards as well as the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for waiving of the payment by An Bord lascaigh Mhara of interest unpaid, including interest on interest unpaid, under sections 20 and 21 of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952. The technical provisions in this section will enable interest charges payable by BIM, which occurred as a result of bad debts associated with loans to fishermen in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to be waived, thus addressing the long-standing imbalance on the balance sheet of BIM. The oil crises of the late 1970s and early 1980s and a decade of high interest rates caused severe <Col N="983" /> financial difficulties for fishing vessel owners. Many fishermen found themselves unable to make repayments on loans provided by BIM. In certain cases loans were deemed to be irrecoverable. While the level of irrecoverable debt was revised substantially upwards in the late 1980s, the necessary waivers were not provided in order to balance BIM's debt position. The BIM balance sheet at 31 October 1999 shows a large technical imbalance between repayments due to the Exchequer on advances made to BIM and the value of loans due to BIM by fishermen. A total of £13.6 million is technically due by BIM to the Exchequer, while the value of loans is just £3.9 million. This leaves an imbalance of £9.7 million. Department of Finance sanction was granted in November of this year to waive the repayment of advances amounting to £9.7 million. However, the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1963, can only be employed to waive the repayment of future interest and cannot provide for the waiver of interest arrears. Approximately £4 million in interest arrears is now due by BIM. As interest is charged on interest arrears, the latter will continue to accumulate substantially unless action is taken. This provision will clear these interest arrears once and for all.</P>
    <P>In section 30 I am amending the Marine Institute Act, 1991, to extend the institute's functions to include matters relating to shipping and shipping services. In addition, I am establishing within the Marine Institute an office to be known as the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, and I am giving that office functions appropriate to a development and promotional agency for the Irish shipping and shipping services sector. Just as the Marine Institute has created its own dynamic so too will the Irish Maritime Development Office &ndash; a dynamic based on delivery and performance. The maritime development office is to be set up within the Marine Institute as a constituent part of its operations. I set up the institute during my first term of office as Minister for the Marine. The institute has grown over the last seven years and now employs in excess of 100 people and has a budget of £13 million for 1999. Once established, the IMDO will be on trial. Its future existence will be dependent on it delivering on its mandate. Locating the office initially within the Marine Institute presents the most cost-effective option, as well as providing major strategic opportunities for both organisations.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 30 which sets up a dedicated development agency for the promotion and development of our shipping industry and onshore shipping services sector, is a milestone for the industry. For the first time, the shipping industry and its onshore services sector will have its own dedicated development office, fully funded and staffed. The lack of such a body has, heretofore, hampered the growth of our shipping sector. With 95 per cent of our trade carried by sea, there are real opportunities to develop the <Col N="984" /> Irish fleet, consolidate and develop employment at sea and onshore, to attract ships to the Irish ship register and to improve the shipping services sector with the help of a new, high quality and professional maritime development office.</P>
    <P>Forecasts suggest that there will be major growth &ndash; a doubling on some projections &ndash; of world shipping in the next 15 years. Seaborne trade worldwide is set to expand faster than ever before. Much of the world's shipping tonnage is due to be replaced over the next ten to 15 years. Corresponding increases in related services, such as ship servicing, insurance, brokerage, manning, chartering and maritime legal services, are also predicted. Ireland possesses vast marine resources, is an island nation and people, and relies on shipping and port industries to service our buoyant tiger economy. This industry is crying out for attention and it deserves its own specialist development, promotional and marketing arm.</P>
    <P>Ireland has many advantages which position it to considerably increase maritime-based activity. The growth in world shipping offers Irish-based institutions opportunities to participate directly in the global expansion of seaborne trade. These opportunities arise, not only through the acquisition and operation of increased shipping tonnage, but also in related activities such as financing new and second-hand ships, building on the proven success of the Irish Financial Services Centre. Irish maritime expertise has been built on our seafaring tradition and will serve us well as we face into the new millennium in our unique position at the hub of transatlantic routes.</P>
    <P>I am setting up the maritime development office within the Marine Institute as a constituent part of its operations. The new office will report to me through the institute's board, and six-monthly progress reports will be required for its first three years of operation. The remit of the office will be to promote and assist the development of Irish shipping and Irish shipping services, in conformity with the EU guidelines on State aid for maritime transport; to promote Ireland as a centre for ship registration; to develop and implement a strategic framework for the shipping industry and its ancillary services sector; and to liaise with and support the industry, advise on policy initiatives and the overhaul of the legislative and fiscal framework for the mercantile marine, so as to underpin industrial development and safeguard and generate employment.</P>
    <P>The office will be subject to rigorous performance monitoring. It must attract to Ireland additional marine-related service sector operations and major players in international shipping in the manning, technical, chartering and financial areas. I will be looking to the office to generate additional Irish seafarer employment together with new indigenous marine services sector businesses.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that there needs to be the fullest possible consultation with, and participation by, the shipping and shipping services <Col N="985" /> industry in the formulation and implementation of development plans by the maritime development office. I am setting up an advisory group to the IMDO and will very shortly appoint its chairman and members, including representatives from the shipping and shipping services sector, the IDA and relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen that the Government's revised An Action Programme for the Millennium, published a few weeks ago, recognises the critical importance of our maritime sector and commits itself to the establishment of a maritime development office and a national maritime college. I will not waste any time in getting the IMDO up and running. A full-time director for the new office and supporting executive and administrative staff will be recruited as quickly as possible, and the advisory group appointed. We are charting a new course for the shipping industry. I want the IMDO to be fully operational by the millennium and I will work closely with the board of the Marine Institute to deliver new jobs and create a new confidence within the industry that will encourage increased investment and innovation.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing a minor amendment to section 30 of the Bill on Committee Stage to underline, for the avoidance of doubt, that seafarer training may be one of the policy matters which I may specify for implementation by the Irish maritime development office. I see this function as being a necessary adjunct to the IMDO's remit, given the critical importance of seafarer training in the development of Irish shipping and Irish shipping services, and the upcoming development of a new national maritime college. Deputies Finucane and Bell recognise the urgency of getting these matters into operation and I thank them for the co-operation on this Bill which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>I preface my remarks by saying that I expressed reservations about this Bill yesterday, based on the situation which prevailed at that time. There appeared to be an anxiety to push this legislation through before 14 December, and I made it clear that Fine Gael would not co-operate with that objective. However, the situation has changed and, as I stated on the Order of Business this morning, we will do everything possible to facilitate and expedite the passage of the Bill because we recognise its importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At last the House is discussing the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill which has been in preparation for more than two years. The Minister requested the deferment of elections to the regional fisheries boards on 26 November 1997 to allow for a comprehensive review of the structures, services and organisation of the inland fisheries sector. The deferment was for a period of 12 months and it was anticipated that this legislation would be in place by the end of 1998. In late 1998, the Minister requested a further postponement of elections to the regional fisheries boards and the Bill has been published one year later.The fisheries <Col N="986" /> boards were established in 1980 and have been active in the management of the inland fisheries and sea-angling sectors. Almost 20 years later, it is timely that the operations of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards have been reviewed. In July 1994, the Central Fisheries Board commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand to review its operations and those of the regional fisheries boards. The cost of this consultancy and subsequent advise was £64,849. While the report found that the Central Fisheries Board had expertise, it was lacking in policy direction and there were deficiencies in its dealings with the Department and the regional fisheries boards. Having commissioned the report, the Central Fisheries Board rejected it, mainly because it did not agree with some of the findings. The regional fisheries boards also disassociated themselves from the report &ndash; so much for a report costing £65,000 for which, I presume, the Exchequer subsequently paid.</P>
    <P>A further consultancy report was produced by Price Waterhouse in 1995 which reviewed the organisation and management of the fisheries service. This report encompassed sea fisheries, inland fisheries and relevant agencies, and came up with some options, namely, abolishing the Central Fisheries Board and allocating its powers to the regional boards. It also recommended that the existing structure of the central and regional boards be replaced by a new national inland fisheries agency which would be responsible for all the roles currently discharged by the central and regional boards, and the management of ESB fisheries. The report also recommended assigning other duties to the new agency.</P>
    <P>Based on the findings of both reports, there was an urgent need for clarification of the future roles and responsibilities of the central and regional fisheries boards. Currently the Central Fisheries Board comprises 13 people which includes six ministerial nominees and the seven chairmen of the regional boards. The primary responsibility of the board is the overall co-ordination of the regional boards and the provision of direction and other specialised services when required to the regional boards.</P>
    <P>In a value for money examination of the management of the inland fisheries in July 1997 the Comptroller and Auditor General stated that the Central Fisheries Board has a very unclear role. The examination also criticised the fact that none of the recommendations of the two previous consultancy reports, which would have given the board a clearer role, were implemented. Criticism has also been expressed that the board, the majority of which is formed by the seven regional chairmen, would give greater priority to regional over national interests. The proposal under section 23 of the Bill for a revamped Central Fisheries Board is to reduce the number of members from 13, with the Minister appointing all eight members, including the chairman. I welcome the fact that one of the members will be nominated by the Minister for the Environment <Col N="987" /> and Local Government. This is necessary to ensure there is no unnecessary duplication between local authorities and the regional fisheries boards in the area of water pollution. There is a necessity for greater clarity in the roles of both organisations.</P>
    <P>I am most critical of section 8 of the Bill which deals with the composition of the regional fisheries boards. Currently, the composition of regional boards varies from 20 to 21 members. Seven members are appointed by the Minister and the balance are appointed by the various angling interests. The Minister intends appointing eight of the 16 members and the chairman. The balance of eight members will be appointed by angling interests. The Minister's intention is to appoint persons with knowledge of farming, aquaculture regional tourism, community enterprise, the environment, national heritage and local staff of boards. While the Minister's intention is to broaden the composition of boards, we should not lose sight of the fact that they are regional boards, and it is my contention that the Minister might throw the baby out with the bath water.</P>
    <P>These comments are based on the legislation as presented. Although it took two years of deliberations, more seemed to be achieved through consensus, dialogue and consultation yesterday in two hours. I wonder about the level of consultation which took place between officials in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the different interests involved in fisheries over the past two years. I am concerned that the members of the review group were sworn to secrecy about the contents of their report. Members representing the various fisheries organisations said they did not see the contents of the report. Yet for the first time yesterday they turned up at the Department and the report was willingly handed out &ndash; the Minister used the term &ldquo;on request&rdquo;. The Department could have saved itself much embarrassment in drafting the legislation if proper consultation took place with the different organisations concerned. I wonder about the deferment of the election of officers over two years and what the Department was doing in processing the legislation. It was obvious at all stages that certain fundamental aspects of the legislation would be subject to serious question by the different interests, which transpired.</P>
    <P>The area of responsibility of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board includes the inland fisheries of the Shannon catchment, the River Feale catchment in north Kerry, the rivers of County Clare and a coastal area from Kerry Head to Hags Head in County Clare. How confident is the Minister that a reduction to 16 members will adequately represent that entire region? The reduction in the numbers of elected members will militate against the main thrust of the Bill which is to move responsibility to local level, involving those with an interest in fisheries development and their conservation. The Minister should think again, as he has done, as his appointment of 50 <Col N="988" /> per cent of the proposed membership would be anti-democratic. He should not disenfranchise the fishing groups which traditionally represented their membership on the board. I am glad that at the 11th hour the Minister has changed this provision. There was also strong opposition to the Minister nominating the chairman of the board. The chairman should be elected by the members of the regional boards, not the Minister, and I am glad this has been acceded to as it will mean a fairer situation will prevail.</P>
    <P>Our main rivers cover 13,800 kilometres while our fresh water lakes comprise about 145,000 hectares. The overall area of our rivers, lakes and waterways puts into perspective the necessity of guarding our water quality. The regional fisheries boards have a vital role in pollution control. I commend them in their vigilance over the years in this area. They have been prepared to take the legislative route where necessary. Thankfully, the trend in recent years has been a reduction in serious incidents of pollution. However, there is concern at the increase in the incidents of moderate and slight pollution. In many cases the various local authorities are contributing to the problem, with sewage being discharged into our waterways. In recent times there has been some improvement, with new sewerage plants and upgrading of existing plants. However, much more needs to be done in this area. There is much concern about eutrophication of our lakes and there is an urgent necessity for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to provide sufficient finance to ensure we have good quality water. Otherwise there will be ongoing threats to our fish habitats.</P>
    <P>From reading some of the accounts of the fisheries boards and other documentation, I wonder what amount of overall funding is provided for the anti-pollution activities of boards. I would like the Department to examine this aspect and equate the percentage spend with that on other aspects of boards' activities. I ask the Minister to examine this in the context of what has been appearing in newspapers in recent times, given that our future quality of life will depend very much on our water quality. For example, in Limerick the River Maigue has the record for being the second most polluted river in the country. It was a famous fishing river many years ago. In order to address this the various interest groups, such as the county council, Teagasc, the IFA and the ICMSA, are working in tandem with farmers in the catchment area, with an emphasis on partnership and persuasion. It is extremely important that the different sections which have an interest in sustaining water quality are involved. There should be a carrot rather than a stick approach in this regard. Obviously if this approach fails it may be necessary to proceed by way of legislation, but we should act as persuaders, cajoling people to take action.</P>
    <P>There are about 150 farms in the area of the river and its tributaries. If each of these were given the opportunity to enhance their farmyard pollution control we would see considerable <Col N="989" /> improvement. In order to stimulate these improvements it is necessary to have an appropriate pollution grant scheme in place which will provide the necessary incentive in many cases. There is a control of farmyard pollution scheme in place and in the context of the national development plan it is important that we sustain it. In harsh economic times farmers must have economic sustenance by way of grants if they are to carry out the works required. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, working in tandem with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, should ensure such a grant prevails because it is in the long-term interest of the water quality and fish habitats.</P>
    <P>I pay a special tribute to the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board for the manner in which it has approached this. I trust it will be successful and restore the water quality of the river and improve the fishing stocks. I am sure the other regional fisheries board are doing similar work. Regional fisheries boards must adopt this approach in future to ensure our water quality is improved considerably.</P>
    <P>The concept of catchment management mentioned in the Bill is a laudable objective as all the stakeholders have an interest in ensuring good water quality. However, it is imperative that trout and salmon anglers have a pivotal role in the catchment management area as they have always adopted a responsible approach. If the Minister loses sight of their important role, the catchment management approach may not work. A project in this area in the lakes of Killarney has not been successful and perhaps it is because of the approach adopted. Whatever is done, all the stakeholders must be on board and must act positively. That is where catchment management will come into its own.</P>
    <P>Fisheries protection can often be a dangerous occupation, and fisheries staff often must display great tolerance although they can be the subject to threats of abuse and violence. It is only right that we should thank them for their work in the fishery protection area. Much of their time is devoted to the protection of salmon.</P>
    <P>In June 1996, under the guidance of the then Minister, Deputy Barrett, and Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, the report on the salmon management task force was published. It was also proposed that a national salmon commission comprising the appropriate interests be set up. I am pleased this will happen under the Bill. The commission will decide on the total available catches and the strategies to be adopted.</P>
    <P>The salmon task force report was published after much consultation with net men, rod men and other interested parties. The commercial salmon fishing catches were affected when various conservation measures were introduced in 1997. In fairness to commercial salmon fishing interests, they co-operated with the measures introduced. When the salmon commission is in place, a vital part of its work will be to carcase tag all salmon killed for sale. This will require an identifiable <Col N="990" /> tag. It will then be possible to quantify the number of salmon killed.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that, while it was promised that all 35 fish counters would be in place by the end of 1999, only 22 have been installed. We have been promised that the balance of 13 will be in place by the end of next year. These fish counters will provide valuable information on salmon numbers and will assist in providing specific spawning target estimates for each of the rivers. This valuable information will help to underpin the quota scheme. Thus, there will be controls on the number of tags to be made available.</P>
    <P>The Minister must recognise the important role of the salmon angling clubs and their responsibilities over the years. I met representatives of the clubs recently and was impressed by their commitment and approach and the interest they displayed in the overall area of salmon fishing. Organisations such as the salmon anglers organisation, the trout anglers organisation and other angling organisations have a credible name. When a fair quota allocation for each angler has been determined, it should be possible for tags to be allocated by the club secretary. Perhaps the Department would examine that because most club secretaries are sincere people who will distribute tags as appropriate, keep log books and return unused tags. That would give appropriate recognition to their efforts and would help the fisheries boards in administering the scheme. It is only when all the quota and tagging systems are in place that consideration should be given to a voluntary buy-out of interested net men.</P>
    <P>The five year plan of the Central Fisheries Board referred to a voluntary buy-out of commercial salmon fisheries to enhance the stocks for rod angling. It also stated that the regional fisheries boards would endeavour to provide alternative enterprises for commercial fishermen. Despite the changes proposed in the Bill and in the future role of the Central Fisheries Board, I trust the many commitments made in the five year plan will not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>The Northern Regional Fisheries Board is to be complimented on its innovation with its counterparts in the North on the successful INTERREG II Erne salmon management programme. The budget of £1.77 million will help to fund a major restoration programme of wild salmon in the Erne. It is anticipated that the next peace and reconciliation programme will make £5 million available for suitable cross-Border projects. It is recognised that the legislation will help strengthen the role of the northern boards in this area. I gather from my meetings with the regional fisheries board managers that they are excited by the legislation and see it as devolving duties and responsibilities to them. That is positive. The Minister mentioned the principle of subsidiarity. What is happening here will certainly help that cause.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would examine the role of the ESB in the fisheries area and determine if it is compatible with the company's current role. <Col N="991" /> The ESB has had a caretaking role in the Shannon since 1935. There is dissatisfaction with that role and it now seems the Shannon eel fishermen and the Lough Derg anglers will seek a judicial review of the ESB's caretaking of the river. The eel fishermen apportion the blame for the decline in eels to the ESB and do not accept they are responsible. I am also reliably informed that the ESB at Ardnacrusha does not operate the fish counters as it is embarrassed by the small run of salmon. It is time for a debate on the ESB's role in this fishery area.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is enacted, the Minister should attempt to compile a fisheries legislation consolidation Bill and examine the ESB's role. This must be done if we are to be taken seriously and improve the situation of the regional fisheries boards. The Minister's action in devolving the Moy fishery to the North-Western Fisheries Board was positive, as were similar actions with other fisheries administered separately by the Central Fisheries Board. However, we must take it a stage further. We must ensure as far as possible that the regional fisheries boards are responsible for the fisheries in their regions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had more than two years to ensure this legislation will be a success. I was disappointed when I read it initially and certainly disappointment was expressed by people in the sector because I received a huge amount of correspondence on this issue. All my colleagues were successfully lobbied by the fishing organisations which voiced their concerns on the Bill and they also articulated their concerns to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it changed yesterday for the better. There is great concern, especially among the angling organisations, that the consultative process was unsatisfactory. The Trout Anglers Federation stated it received no report from the review group of development co-operative societies. While it had a representative on the board, he was instructed as a member of the committee to keep the content of the deliberations of the board to himself. The Trout Anglers Federation has a valid point about the level of consultation. Section 28 reforms the management structure and funding mechanisms of the co-op producers. It replaces the existing electoral system with a wholly appointed membership. It must be pointed out that shareholders purchase share certificates over a seven year period in anticipation of having an opportunity to stand as candidates and vote in elections to the societies as well as the regional boards. Understandably, they may feel disenfranchised as shareholder members of the co-ops if direct appointments proceed. If proper discussions were held on this legislation, the understandable concerns of TAFI, FISSTA and NARA could be addressed. The deletion of the former life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust <Col N="992" /> from consideration for election as members of the regional fisheries boards has also caused a great deal of concern, especially with TAFI. Following the discussions which took place with the various representative organisations yesterday and in light of the Minister's amended statement today, many of those difficulties have possibly been resolved.</P>
      <P>There is provision for the direct appointment of the chairman and five ordinary members of the Central Fisheries Board who will nominate the representatives of the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. There is a real danger that angling representatives could be excluded and it is imperative that angling interests are represented on the board. I believe that is currently being considered.</P>
      <P>In preparation for today's debate on the Bill, I have carried out a great deal of research, read the consultants' report and studied documents such as the one produced by the Central Fisheries Board in 1997. It is regrettable that the board was not very proactive prior to 1997 because a commitment was given in 1980, when the board was originally established, that it would produce reports every five years. I am open to correction on this point but I understand that the 1997 document was the first one produced by the board and it was probably spurred on by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The board seems to be concerned at what it perceives to be a devolution of its powers. However, the members of the board had sufficient time to get their act together but they do not seem to have done so. I fully support the principle of subsidiarity. The board was somewhat optimistic in regard to tourism figures. The 1998 report of Bord Fáilte showed that while the number of visitors had risen steadily over a five year period, the number engaged in angling had declined. All types of angling were affected. However, the numbers of overseas visitors participating in game angling had declined at a slower rate than other types of angling. Overseas tourists, who fished while in Ireland, contributed an estimated £61.7 million to the economy in 1998 whereas the figure was £80 million in 1996. That represents a shift in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>It seems somewhat contradictory for us to seek to improve the fisheries scene if, parallel to that, we fail to increase tourism numbers. We have an excellent product, be it game angling, coarse angling or sea angling, we have a temperate climate and we are influenced by the Gulf Stream. Given the number of rivers and lakes in the country, we have a natural base for tourism. I urge the Minister to engage in serious discussions with Bord Fáilte on that issue. I am aware of the tourism angling measures which have been effective in recent years and of the marketing organisations involved in their promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister gave a commitment to the fishermen yesterday and I will be very interested to see what amendments he will table <Col N="993" /> to the Bill. I want to ensure, as I am sure Deputy Bell does, that those amendments will meet the commitments given. The Minister stated that he would formally acknowledge the existence and autonomy of angling clubs and associations. This, he said, would ensure that the new powers being devolved to the regional boards would not be used to dispossess existing clubs and organisations of State on waters which they traditionally fished. I understand the Minister intends to get the parliamentary draftsman to look at that commitment and modify it to meet the language requirements of the Bill. I trust that this commitment will be enshrined in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Appointments are due to be made to regional fisheries boards by way of elections and I assure the Minister we will co-operate fully with the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the views expressed by Deputy Finucane. It appeared that the world championship competitions for salmon and trout fishing were taking place in Leinster House over the past two days and that the Minister was hosting them. We had to wait until the early hours of this morning to meet some of the delegations which visited the House yesterday. This type of activity could and should be avoided. The Department is notorious for rushing in legislation and seeking the co-operation of the Labour and Fine Gael parties in order to meet its deadlines. It is as if we were producing a newspaper rather than introducing legislation. I suggest that the Department needs to be taken by the scruff of the neck and shaken up at every level. I have expressed this view on previous occasions and I hope the Minister will fulfil his responsibilities in this respect.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister conceded a number of the very important points raised by the various representative groups, albeit at the 11th hour. At one point, it seemed we might have another civil war on our hands if the number of protests, correspondence and visiting delegations I received over the past week are anything to go by.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Finucane, I recognise that the Minister has agreed to all the proposals made by the TAFI last night. I have gone through its proposals with them and its members understand that agreement has been reached on all the issues which they brought to the Minister's notice and with which they disagreed. I look forward to the amendments which will give effect to that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue has not been referred to in all the discussions and representations and in the proposals outlined in the Minister's speech. The staff of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards have not been mentioned; it is almost as if they did not exist. They play a very important role and are charged with the responsibility of putting into effect legislative provisions, ministerial orders and board decisions. I intend to make this issue my primary focus on Committee <Col N="994" /> Stage. I will do so as a member and former national officer of SIPTU which represents the majority of staff in the Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards. They should have the right to elect at least one staff representative as has happened in regard to port boards and in other State and semi-State sectors. Why should they be ignored? Why should they have to wait for second or third hand information to apply the regulations and policies set down by this Parliament and by the boards themselves? I intend to table an amendment on this issue which I hope the Minister will accept.</P>
    <P>I would have liked the Minister to refer in his speech to the staff. Perhaps the Minister would indicate in his reply that he will agree to bring forward an amendment so that staff will have the right under this legislation to have representation on the central and regional boards. That is required because the staff are not being consulted in a proper and democratic way; they are being instructed. They have to do the donkey work but they are not recognised when it comes to representation. Hoteliers, environmental organisations, fisheries, angling, net men, mussel men and so on are represented but staff do not have a statutory right to representation on the central and regional boards. It is my primary objective to ensure that happens and that this matter is effectively dealt with before the legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been more than two years in preparation and its emergence on the Order Paper today is, to say the least, long overdue. The election for the Regional Fisheries Boards was postponed in 1997 and again in 1998 to facilitate the preparation and enactment of this legislation. The process of formulating this Bill should not have been delayed to such an extent. Such delays lead to confusion, frustration and lack of progress. I sincerely hope such time lags do not become a feature of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources as they have in the past.</P>
    <P>Because of the length of time it has taken to prepare this legislation, the Labour Party expected a major reforming Bill on inland fisheries and that the Minister would take the opportunity to consolidate all legislation in relation to inland fisheries, but this was not done. However, the Bill, as it stands, does not include provisions which would ensure that our fisheries are set on a secure and structured footing. In this respect, I welcome the Minister's commitment to take on board many of the concerns I have expressed about this Bill and those which have been well voiced by representatives of those engaged in inland fisheries, staff and other interests.</P>
    <P>If, from the outset, the Minister had considered the important issues of a balanced and acceptable makeup of the regional fisheries boards, the inclusion of an angling staff representative on the Central Fisheries Board and other key inclusions under the remit of the co-operatives, this Bill would have been far more acceptable than it is in its present form.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> Inland fisheries legislation is fragmented comprising the 1959 Act, the Acts which introduced and repealed the rod licence and various other enactments. The Bill is expressed as amendments to specific enactments of other legislation and is, therefore, difficult to follow. It is a reflection of the confusing nature of the inland fisheries legislative framework.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes we need consolidating legislation governing all of the inland fisheries. Given the amount of time the Minister took to prepare this Bill, we very much regret that the opportunity to introduce consolidating legislation was not availed of. It was only at the eleventh hour that the Minister took the time to meet the fishing interests. The two year drafting phase of this Bill should have included wide consultation with the various interests and trade union groups involved in the industry. It would appear that the trade union representatives, the workers in this industry, are unrecognised in terms of their contribution to the success of this industry.</P>
    <P>The reforms introduced in the Bill are quite limited and, in some cases, will have to be significantly amended on Committee Stage. I look forward to seeing the amendments the Minister will bring forward. I hope we get those amendments at an early stage so that we will be able to examine them and consult with groups which will be affected by them. I ask the Minister to take note of that.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill appears to be to redefine the relationship between the Minister, the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards. The Minister appears to have done two things. First, he is strengthening the role of the regional boards, redefining the Central Fisheries Boards and having a supporting and co-ordinating function. The Labour Party supports this shift in emphasis. It also recognises the role played by the staff of the CFB and RFBs and recommends that this should be recognised by the Minister in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries Act, 1980, gave rise to a fairly confused relationship between the central and the regional boards and this could only be clarified by strengthening the role of the central board at the expense of the regions or strengthening the regional boards at the expense of the centre. The Labour Party supports the strengthening of the regional and the central boards. However, we are disappointed that in doing so, the Minister also appears to be strengthening his own position and that of the Department at the expense of the boards. The amendments the Minister said he would bring forward may change that emphasis, and I look forward to that. He should have delegated to the central board many of the functions he holds. This would be real delegation and decentralisation. The control of too many functions in the industry is kept in the Minister's Department. As I said before, in terms of performance, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources would not be high on my list <Col N="996" /> and would probably be at the bottom of the lists of most of my colleagues in the House.</P>
    <P>We take issue with a number of provisions of the Bill. The provision in section 10 whereby the Minister may give specific directions to the boards not only in relation to general policy matters, but in relation to the day to day management of the boards is an excessive intrusion by the Minister and Department in the daily functions of the boards. In addition, the Minister has taken the upper hand in the appointment of both the central board and the regional boards. We do not believe that is democratic and that the Minister should be able to appoint the membership of the central board and half the membership of each regional board. I hope we can return to that issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is a case for a reduction in the overall size of the regional boards which with 21 members were somewhat unwieldy. However, the way in which the Minister has done this is seriously disenfranchising those who have the greatest interest and involvement in the inland fisheries sector and the anglers and fishermen. We do not want people appointed on a political basis; there has been far too much of that over the years. We want appointed people with qualifications and who are dedicated, irrespective of whether they are a member of a branch or cumann of a party. This Bill significantly reduces the right of the angler and those involved in inland fisheries to elect representatives to the boards. Perhaps as a result of what the Minister said this morning that will be corrected by amendments to which I look forward.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill local farmers and hoteliers, for example, will have as great a right to have equal representation on the regional fisheries boards as the organisation representing fishermen and workers. This is highly undemocratic and I cannot imagine a body established to deal with agricultural matters would allow only one representative of the farming community, which is what this Bill does in allowing one representative from each of the main angling interests. This Government appears to have held a grudge against the angling organisations since the rod licence dispute of the late 1980s and that grudge appears to be given expression by keeping representation of angling interests on the regional fisheries boards to a bare minimum and by changing the composition of the fisheries co-operative societies, established as a direct response to the rod licence settlement. The same sentiments seem to apply to net fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will put down amendments on Committee Stage seeking increased representation and recognition of angling and other fishing interests as well as the interests of staff in the institutes being re-established under this legislation. I take issue with the Minister giving himself the right to nominate the entire membership of the Central Fisheries Board, half the membership of the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board and, in an unprecedented move, the chairman of each board. This <Col N="997" /> arrangement is not democratic and we will end up with the Minister stuffing the boards with party supporters rather than having the boards representative of genuine fisheries interests.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes establishing on a statutory basis a National Salmon Commission as well as fish tagging and wild salmon and sea trout conservation. The Labour Party supports this proposal. I chaired the Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy which examined the report of the salmon task force and some of the report's recommendations are in this Bill, as Deputy Finucane will know. The Bill has not gone far enough with the report's recommendations and I hope that is followed up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>These proposals emanated from the policy pursued in the report of the Salmon Task Force which was established by Deputy Gilmore when he was Minister of State and which was chaired by Professor Noel Wilkins of University College Galway. The report of that task force set out a new blueprint for the conservation of wild salmon. We sometimes forget that the wild North Atlantic salmon, which has been one of our national symbols since the time of the Fianna, is in serious danger of extinction. We know that the stocks of wild salmon are in decline and that many rivers which used to be good salmon fisheries are now almost devoid of salmonoid stock. The report of the task force was radical and far-reaching and, again, it is regrettable that it has taken this Government so long to build on the reforming initiatives Deputy Gilmore initiated.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the proposed tagging system with which I am concerned is the provision that it is being established on a cost recovery basis, as this will not work. We either value our wild salmon resource or we do not. If we do, we should commit the necessary resources to conserve it. The provision in the Bill that the scheme will only be established on a cost recovery basis is a recipe for postponement and delay and the longer we delay and postpone action in relation to conserving wild salmon, the lower our stocks will become and the harder it will be to achieve recovery. When does the Minister intend to introduce the tagging system? Does he intend to allow a proper lead-in time for its implementation? What will the starting point be? What will happen to the existing system, which has been in operation for a number of years? The Minister should clarify this matter.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Bill does not provide for the establishment on a statutory basis of a catchment management system for all our fisheries. When the committee I chaired considered the task force report we met representatives of all interests from all over the country and those interests feared that the establishment of a catchment management system would be forced upon them. Deputy Finucane will remember that our understanding was that this would be done by agreement with all parties concerned at local level within the catchment area. I ask the Minister to establish this system. I often fish in Kerry <Col N="998" /> and there is concern in that area that, for example, the legislation will impose the catchment management system on the Laune valley rather than on a voluntary basis. The Minister should respond to those fears.</P>
    <P>The concept of catchment management was first promoted by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore. The idea was that a fishery catchment, for example the Boyne, would be identified and that a management framework would be established for that catchment which would involve all the fisheries and economic interests and community organisations which have an interest in that fishery. This process would deepen the involvement of all interests and fisheries in the management and help the development of our fisheries resources. It can be better achieved on a voluntary basis. It would deepen democratic involvement at ground level in the management of our fisheries and would be the most effective way of dealing with problems of poaching and pollution. It would be an ideal way of involving all those angling clubs around the country which have carried out such tremendous work in minding our fisheries and very often in their redevelopment directly in the management of our fisheries, as well as the net men who have carried out tremendous work in caring for our fisheries, often at their own expense and in their own time. Will the Minister ensure in his discussions with the fishing interests that this happens before this Bill is passed? The angling organisations have called on the Minister not to rush this Bill through the House and, on behalf of the Labour Party, I support that call. Time and care should be taken to examine in detail all the new provisions in this legislation. I understand the importance of having the Bill passed by the 16 December deadline and I would like to be involved in legislation that, probably for the first time in the history of the State, will co-ordinate fisheries in the North and the Republic. That would be a tremendous day. We will endeavour to do so provided the Minister co-operates with us, as co-operation in the House is a two-way process. The Minister should take on board Opposition spokespersons' points and, within reason, attempt to meet them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider favourably the amendments which will be tabled by the Labour Party. These amendments will be structured and constructive and will be designed to strengthen the legislation. Our inland fisheries resource is important to the people of this country in terms of our tourist economy, leisure and recreation as well as our environment. We have seen reports recently of the deteriorating quality of our drinking water and we have had many examples in recent years of serious pollution in our inland waterways. The ultimate test of an inland waterway is the ability of fish to survive and thrive in it. For that reason the Labour Party believes that ultimate responsibility for water pollution control should be transferred to the fisheries boards under the control of the central body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> I have been a member of a local authority for over 25 years and am very familiar with this matter. For example, if the Boyne was polluted within the borough boundary of Drogheda, under current legislation it is not controlled by the local authority in Drogheda but by the county council in Dundalk. That is the wrong way to control pollution in our rivers and lakes. It is cumbersome, costly and ineffective &ndash; that is the worst aspect of it. At one level, responsibility for the Water Pollution Acts rests with the local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government while at another level responsibility under the Inland Fisheries Acts are exercised by the regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>What a convoluted way to deal with a jigsaw puzzle. The problems associated with water pollution fall between the two and are often unattended. Nobody knows who is responsible for them. That is the reason for the delay in establishing who is responsible for polluting our rivers and lakes and for killing the fish.</P>
    <P>The time has come to rationalise and, perhaps, give overall responsibility for water quality and water pollution to the fisheries boards. It will be necessary to give the boards the necessary resources to carry out those tasks. I will return to this topic on Committee Stage. I have received a number of representations about the Central Fisheries Board. My colleagues in SIPTU have difficulty with some aspects of the Bill, for example, the statement in the explanatory memorandum that there will be no additional cost implications. What does that mean? Is the Bill legislating for wages and costs controls?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a standard provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister responded. I hope that is not the intention. The explanatory memorandum is not the Bill, but I ask the Minister to take on board those concerns. If there were such controls, it would be the first time the Dáil imposed cost restrictions in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It just means it is not a money Bill. The money has to come a different route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will meet my concern in a positive way. My trade union colleagues will be watching to ensure he does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made in the submissions I received related to the number of key posts which have not been filled in the Central Fisheries Board. How can we be serious about implementing this legislation, supervising and patrolling the industry at national level and dealing with subsidiary bodies if key posts in the Central Fisheries Board have not been filled long after they were vacated? Perhaps the Minister would explain. I was flabbergasted to discover that while we are trying to improve the fisheries <Col N="1000" /> sector and to pass hurried legislation to update the industry, key areas of administration at the industry's centre have not been filled. I intend to put down a parliamentary question on this matter. I cannot do so until the new year due to notice requirements, but I intend to ask the Minister how many vacancies exist in the various sectors and why they have not been filled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has conceded at the 11th, if not the 12th, hour. I have shadowed the Minister in a number of offices and always found that if a reasonable argument is put to him, he will endeavour to meet it. Since this Government took office, Deputy Finucane and I have tried to work with the Minister in a constructive way. Many of our proposals and amendments to legislation have been accepted. This Bill, although limited, is one of the most important Bills introduced by the Minister and I ask him to give serious consideration to the amendments we will put down on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will reiterate my key point. If this legislation, the Central Fisheries Board and the new regional structures are to work effectively, there must be worker representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. In a county which has relied on the three Fs &ndash; fishing, farming and Fruit of the Loom &ndash; we have found that of all Ministers, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, has always reacted in a positive and progressive manner to assist in the development of the fishing sector. I commend him on the initiative he has demonstrated since coming into office by giving long overdue recognition to our island status and in effectively lobbying the fishermen's case in Europe.</P>
      <P>In a relatively short time, the age profile of the white fish fleet has been improved, secondhand boats have been given a new lease of life and safety for vessels in general is being supported. In each of these areas we were beginning from a low base. At last, we are heading in the right direction and I congratulate the Minister on his successful efforts earlier this week which will ensure the £70 million investment in the renewal programme can continue. Nowhere is this overdue action recognised more than in the large white fish port in Greencastle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we have seen the development of piers, harbours and slipways. The Minister has been to the fore in developing this basic infrastructure. Large developments are not confined to the traditionally supported locations but include regions north of the Galway-Dublin divide. For the first time in as long as many can remember, the smaller structures of slipways, piers and small harbours are getting recognition. This is not mere platitudes but has in many cases been a vital support whereby infrastructure which <Col N="1001" /> was ignored for years is saved, strengthened and given a new potential.</P>
    <P>A classic example of regeneration of a port is that of Carrickarory in Moville. This was one of the last ports to be claimed back from British control approximately seven years ago and was in a sad state of repair. It was once a busy commercial pier that was the hub of the area and gave employment to the locality. Deliberate neglect left it in a dangerous state. Many former Ministers visited and condemned it. Condemnation of neglect is merely a reaction but a positive action did not emerge until the current Minister, Deputy Woods, saw the potential and supplied the necessary finance to save this vital infrastructure. Given its geographical location, we now have a resource that can continue to expand and will realise more potential for the northern region.</P>
    <P>For once, a Minister can see the value of an investment that others locally have striven to portray for many years. This is only one example of support that has made a real difference. I am sure this story can be replicated along the entire coast. I know of a number of fishermen and communities in Inishowen who have many well developed plans for infrastructure in their areas. All of them &ndash; Malin Head, Bonagee, Leenan, Buncrana and Inch, for example &ndash; are worthwhile projects that will have a positive impact on the economy of the region.</P>
    <P>I commend the Marine Institute on its work on the marine leisure document. This is a comprehensive report which points to a potential that was largely untapped and under-utilised in the past. The development of the marine leisure industry in other, less obvious, countries has overtaken ours, but we have the resources in place and a new attitude, due to the Celtic tiger, which means we, too, have a future in this sector.</P>
    <P>As we develop our recognition of the importance of our waters from various perspectives, including that of fishing, it is vital that development is pursued in a planned and co-ordinated fashion. There are so many uses being made of our waterways that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources should increase its interaction with local authorities. In some locations a fishing resource would be a priority whereas a marine leisure development might be more appropriate. Difficult decisions will have to be made in many instances, but at a time when, at last, finance is being made available, co-ordination is vital in the development of this infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In that context, the interaction of the local authorities and the Department of the Environment and Local Government is also important in respect of the development of our environmental services which are not yet at European standards. In too many regions we are trying to promote angling or water sports where there might not yet be a basic sewage treatment plant. That <Col N="1002" /> is most unsatisfactory. It is difficult to market angling and water sports when raw sewage is still pumped into many of our rivers.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues I mentioned are outside the realms of the Bill but are, nevertheless, worth mentioning. This Bill addresses the major deficiencies that have existed in the Inland Fisheries Service since the passing of the Fisheries Act, which is now almost 20 years in existence. Until the advent of this Bill there were no changes to the structures in place. The weaknesses of the structures have, however, been outlined on a number of occasions through various reports and studies, including the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.</P>
    <P>People involved in the fishing sector identify the weaknesses as relating to confusion over the roles of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards. It was considered that the roles of the two boards overlapped and that added to the confusion. Onlookers would claim there was a lack of clear focus and direction within the service and that affected the cohesiveness of the service. Negative aspects have been alluded to in respect of the size and composition of the board. Its membership was large, although not truly representative. Many would consider that a further weakness in the structures was a lack of adequate accountability within the system.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1999, provides for the devolution of primary responsibility for conservation, management and promotion of inland fisheries to the regional boards. That is in line not only with Government policy but EU policy. Those are the basic requirements for sustained development and are fundamental to the sector.</P>
    <P>Section 8 clarifies the brief of the boards and gives them new roles in the co-ordination and development of catchment management plans. The Bill provides a new role for the boards in relation to the acquisition and management of fisheries and provides for the devolution of eel fishing authorisations from the Minister to the boards.</P>
    <P>The role envisaged for the regional fisheries boards is in line with that of the Foyle Fisheries Commission. That commission was established under legislation enacted in the early 1950s. The regional fisheries boards, which will have responsibility only for salmon, not aquaculture will concentrate on the conservation, management and promotion of fisheries. Many good sustainable development initiatives are being pursued by the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the following of that ideal by many other boards must be very welcome.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the primary role of the Central Fisheries Board will be to provide specialist support and co-ordination services for the regional boards. While the two authorities will work together, the Central Fisheries Board <Col N="1003" /> will have responsibility for presenting the national fisheries development plans, advising the Minister on policy and policing the performance of regional boards in that it will advise the Minister on their effectiveness in fulfilling their functions.</P>
    <P>I support the aspiration to reduce the membership of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards. It was envisaged that the membership of the Central Fisheries Board would be reduced from 13 to eight and that of the regional fisheries boards from 20 to 16, which would have resulted in the boards being more satisfactory and effective. I commend the Minister on his initiative in meeting representatives of the organisations concerned and following those discussions the proposed changes have been somewhat altered. It is important in any dispute that the people involved should discuss the issues in order to reach a solution as early as possible. I commend the Minister on managing to solve this matter before the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>I am pleased one aspect of the membership of the boards has not changed in that a quota of women will be included on the boards. I am not an advocate of the token women syndrome, but many women are involved in this sector and they have positive contributions to make. Without a stipulation in terms of their inclusion on boards, they did not have a chance to contribute effectively in the past. Their inclusion will ensure a wider range on perspective and a wider gender input from now on, and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a major change in the people encouraged to participate in regional board representation. On the Swilly people engage in fishing, fish farming, jet skiing, canoeing, water skiing, swimming, diving, commercial traffic etc. New farming requirements under the rural environmental protection scheme and under legislation governing natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation impact on our waterways. The opening up of membership of the boards not only counteracts the major criticism levelled previously in relation to the narrow focus of their representations but introduces a new perspective.</P>
    <P>Anglers have been the mainstay of the boards up to now and their involvement is extremely important. Their concerns should be seriously taken into consideration. I commend the Minister on meeting the representatives and I am sure the agreement reached will satisfy all concerned. Legislation can only be effectively implemented when the main players are consulted on the changes sought.</P>
    <P>I appreciate from where the Minister is coming in terms of the expertise he wishes to include on the new boards. The inclusion of people from the farming sector, the aquaculture sector, regional tourism, community enterprise, the environment, <Col N="1004" /> the national heritage, local government and staff of the regional boards indicates the fisheries boards will have a new role. Such expertise seems to offer a new and dynamic possibility for development, but given that it is essentially a fisheries administration, those involved in fisheries should be considered.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in the Bill are admirable, but will the necessary financial resources be allocated to the boards? The Central Fisheries Board will require additional funds, given that it will have responsibility for the co-ordination and delivery of multi-annual strategic plans, the overall supervision of EU and other funding schemes in co-operation with Bord Fáilte, the delivery of overseas marketing and promotion strategies for tourism angling, the delivery of the national policy on inland fisheries and the effective and efficient delivery of cost-cutting services to ensure optimum resource deployment, accountability and corporate governance.</P>
    <P>The regional fisheries boards require additional staff. Their role is primarily perceived to be one of policing, which is wrong. They are grossly understaffed and not as effective as those involved in developing fisheries and angling would like them to be. The work of the boards should include securing their areas but it should also include research and development. Such ideas are more aspirational than real because they are very overstretched in terms of the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt a major challenge faces the boards. Traffic on the waterways has increased. An active interest is being taken at last in our most obvious but most underrated resource. Developing a safe use of our waterways whereby everyone can co-exist in a safe environment must be dealt with in a co-ordinated fashion to realise the potential of this resource. The make-up of the boards suggests that great things may happen and I am sure this challenge will be met by everyone involved.</P>
    <P>I want to raise an issue of major concern to me, the review of the Foyle Fisheries Commission legislation. The delay in its review stems from the setting up of an executive in the North and the cross-Border bodies. I trust that the true potential this forum will offer the north-west, which is a forgotten region, to move centre stage will be taken up by those who are in a position to look to the future. The delay in introducing amending legislation has blocked development in that region. Legislation is needed to cover aquaculture licensing and a local input is required into the management of the River Foyle. I ask the Minister to ensure that a regional office of the commission will be established on the banks of the River Foyle, preferably in a location such as Moville or Greencastle, to give effect to what has been happening on the river, given that 90 per <Col N="1005" /> cent or more fishermen use the River Foyle from the Donegal side.</P>
    <P>It is important that there be liaison between the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the boards. For too long people living in Donegal have had to straddle the Foyle and the Swilly and have had to buy two licences to fish the waters on either side of them. These licences have been vastly different in cost, the hours applicable for fishing have been vastly different, the policing has varied significantly, the lines have been disputed etc. Co-ordination in this area is required to ensure north Donegal people are treated like other citizens. At present there are large discrepancies, which the fishermen feel are not in their favour. I look forward to the executive being formed and the cross-Border bodies being implemented. I trust the Minister can offer us some advice on such a liaison body.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been progressive and supportive of all aspects of the marine. There is a great challenge still ahead, given the starting point from which he has begun. I know he will continue his interest in developing the commercial ports, whitefish ports, fishing-aquaculture ports, marine tourism locations and all the little slipways and infrastructural supports around our coast. The best kept secret is that for every pound spent in these locations we have an investment that will remain long into the future, and repay itself many times over both economically and in terms of the enjoyment people get from using such facilities. I wish the Minister well in his work. Go n-éirí an bóthar leis.</P>

      <P>The Minister took the steam out of my speech by meeting the lobby groups yesterday, although it is regrettable it was the 13th hour before he did so. I compliment our spokesman, Deputy Finucane, on the part he played in meeting these interest groups. He has worked hard in his brief. It is outrageous that the Department did not meet these interest groups for the past two years. What has it been doing during that time? Yesterday, it took two hours for the Minister to agree to deal with the problems facing angling groups. I compliment him on that U-turn. There is nothing wrong with correcting a mistake and I congratulate the Minister on doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As someone from the west, I remember the trout angling dispute in 1987, 1988 and 1989. The anglers expressed their views on that occasion and a few politicians decided to call it a day because they were afraid of what would happen at the next election. Mr. John Paddy Burke from Ballinrobe is the president of the Trout Anglers Federation and although I do not always agree <Col N="1006" /> with him, he is committed to angling, to the federation, to the west and to the lakes. I compliment him on the work he does on a daily basis to promote angling, the lakes in the west and the federation. It is not often we get an opportunity to compliment a person who does such good work.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on reversing his decision on the proposals which caused outrage in the Trout Anglers Federation in recent weeks. That was the right thing to do as the Bill should not have been published. If the Minister had discussed these people's problems and fears, they would have had no need to lobby him in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>This is the first time I prepared a speech since I came into the Dáil. Scripts should not be allowed in the Dáil Chamber. Members, including Ministers and Ministers of State, should be able to speak without a script. They should say what they have to say from the heart.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the Moy fishery. I raised that matter with the previous Government and it agreed to go ahead with it in principle. I compliment the Minister on moving it forward. The Minister is not bad at times. However, it is difficult to get replies from the Department. The only solution is to table parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>Angling is a big business in the west. It brings thousands of people to that part of the country on a regular basis. I compliment Members, such as Deputies Stagg and Bell, for visiting the west on a regular basis because it has wonderful lakes, fish and facilities. They recognise a good product when they see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the Trout Anglers Federation and all those involved in the fishing industry promote and protect this national asset. There have been many pollution scares in recent years. The Minister, his Department, the county councils and the people involved in this sector must be vigilant because we cannot allow anyone in the State to damage or pollute this beautiful and natural asset. Local authorities should not be afraid to deal with people who damage our lakes and rivers. Yesterday residents in County <Col N="1007" /> Kildare, who took such people to court because Kildare County Council did not act, won their case. The State should not leave it to local communities to bring people to court. Local authorities have the resources to deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>I meet drift net fishermen on a regular basis in my constituency. The Minister said he will discuss the problems relating to salmon fishing because there is a lot of misunderstanding between the organisations. Many people, particularly in north Mayo, have tried to make their case to the Department in recent years. They would leave this sector if a buy-out scheme was introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane mentioned the fishery officers. They should be complimented on the good job they do, although they have been criticised. They are the State's representatives, but they are mentioned only when people are caught for poaching or destroying stocks.</P>
    <P>Many amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage. There is no need to rush this Bill through the House. It is important legislation so it should be discussed properly. It took almost two years to draft it. Yesterday, it took two hours to deal with the problems which could have been dealt with weeks ago and would have stopped lobby groups from pressurising us to change it. I compliment the Minister on his response. I hope he takes on board the amendments tabled on Committee Stage. The Minister must deal with many other issues in the next few years.</P>
    <P>This is the time of the year the Minister goes to Brussels to fight for our fishing fleet and for money for Ireland. Coastal erosion must be dealt with because it is destroying our coasts and natural resources. No Government in the past 20 years has done anything about it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the measures proposed in the Bill. The Bill will strengthen the power and role of regional boards, create a new co-ordinating role for the Central Fisheries Board and empower the people and stake-holders in the industry. It will give anglers and other fishing interests effective control over their own affairs and the financial resources to plan and develop the fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will acknowledge that his predecessor, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, laid the ground work for the changes which are now being given legislative effect. Despite my welcome for the Bill, however, the devil was in the detail, as usual. The alarm was sounded when the details of the <Col N="1008" /> constitution of the Central Fisheries Board, the regional fisheries boards and the co-operatives emerged. Angling and other organisations quickly reacted to what would have been a reversal of the agreement which brought an end to the bitter rod licence war ten years ago. That would have been highly regrettable.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister, who is highly experienced in this area, for seeing the potential water mine ahead and avoiding it. He responded positively to the expressed fears and the clearly stated proposals of TAFI, NARA, FISSTA and others. I appreciate that the Minister met a deputation from TAFI, led by John Paddy Burke, for two hours yesterday. The best time for negotiations is the twelfth and a half hour, not the first hour &ndash; they are always more effective then. I thank the Minister for, by and large, reaching agreement on all the points raised by the anglers.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined to the House the principal changes to which he has agreed. It has been said that John Paddy Burke cast his fly on the water, the Minster rose and took it, he was played gently but firmly, was netted and landed in the boat but the priest was not applied to him. Those who do not angle will not know what &ldquo;the priest&rdquo; means but those who do will fully appreciate the remark.</P>
    <P>I will compare the proposals made by the anglers with the changes to which the Minister has agreed. The first proposal from TAFI was a request that one of its members be nominated to the Central Fisheries Board. I do not see that in the Minister's proposed changes but I am sure he will explain that later. The next proposal was that life membership holders of the former Inland Fisheries Trust retain a seat on the regional boards, something the Minister has included in his changes. He has also allowed two trout angling representatives to retain their seats on the boards, thus maintaining the <i>status quo</i>. It has been agreed that the chairpersons of the regional boards &ndash; and I notice the fishermen are being politically incorrect in that they refer to the chairmen rather than chairpersons, I must get on to them about that &ndash; be elected by the democratic vote of all board members. The Minister has accepted the proposal that TAFI representation on the development co-op societies be maintained at the current level. TAFI also recommended that an annual general meeting of the co-operative societies, including audited accounts be included in the legislation, although I am not sure that is included in the proposed changes. It was proposed that the electorate for the election of the development co-operative societies be the current year shareholders, provided that they also held a share certificate in two of the previous five years. This is as per the original agreement and has been included in the Minister's changes. The same criteria will also pertain for the election of trout angling representatives to the regional <Col N="1009" /> boards. This will empower the stake-holders in the industry. I also welcome the Minister's agreement to the immediate formation of a working committee for Committee Stage of the Bill so stake-holders in the industry would be consulted on all Stages.</P>
    <P>I am authorised on behalf of John Paddy Burke and his fellow members to thank the Minister for his positive attitude yesterday. They look forward to further positive co-operation with the Minister to develop the inland fisheries to their full potential, to attract tourists, to create jobs and, from a personal view, to give long hours of relaxation and pleasure to anglers.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill. The Labour Party has no interest in prolonging the Second Stage debate and wishes to allow the House to get to the next Stage as soon as possible so this Bill can become law with the changes now proposed.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1999, is long overdue. The importance of the fishing industry, particularly the trout angling industry, is immense. For years it has been treated as the hind-tit industry in this State. With this Bill, I hope we will see a growth in fishing and angling. The salmon fishing industry has been a bone of contention for many Ministers. Coming from a seaboard constituency in the south west, I know the impact the industry can have on the local economy.  </P>
      <P>I am dubious when I look at the Bill that all the ills afflicting the industry will be cured. Many of the fishery conservation boards should be more representative of the ordinary angler and should seek the preservation of our salmon stocks. Unless we continue to be vigilant, we will not have a successful industry.</P>
      <P>I fear the destruction of our salmon stocks during their migration to Greenland and the waters of the Arctic Circle. The main threat to our salmon stocks exists during the journey to that area and then back to the rivers where they were spawned. There is evidence of huge continental trawlers gathering salmon by the thousand along that route. For some time that has been the cause of the decline in salmon stocks in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Much emphasis was placed on the curtailment of the salmon fishing industry. Every Minister was inclined to shorten the period of fishing for Irish fishermen engaged in the salmon industry. Under no circumstances did those people have anything to do with the decimation of the fishing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill provides for the expansion of the functions of the Marine Institute to include matters related to shipping and shipping services. It provides for the establishment of an Irish marine development office within the institute. The time is overdue for this country to have its own shipping fleet. In the 1930s, 1940s <Col N="1010" /> and early 1950s we had a profitable shipping fleet, but it was dissolved because it became entangled with a Chinese person who put the company into liquidation. I appeal to the Minister to set up an Irish shipping fleet as soon as possible. We are a maritime nation and the Minister should lead the way in this important matter and establish an Irish shipping fleet.</P>

      <P>In welcoming the Bill I congratulate the Minister on having, for once, stolen the thunder of Deputy Ring. I hope this news will be disseminated throughout County Mayo.</P>
      <P>This is important and difficult legislation which affects many constituencies. I am glad the Minister is in a position to steer it carefully through the House, taking into account the many views expressed and representations made to him. It is wrong to say that people have not had an opportunity to look at this legislation. In 1996 the salmon management task force report recommended changes in the fisheries boards to make them more representative, to devolve power and introduce more subsidiarity. The Minister has listened to the views of anglers who felt that their representation on the boards was being diluted. It is not the intention of the Bill to reduce the representation of anglers. Its intention is to expand local involvement and participation, and I welcome this. Anglers cannot be the absolute decision makers in the development of fisheries which belong to the State as the representative of the people. County Donegal which comes within the remit of the Northern Regional Fisheries Board is a very fragmented area that includes the largest commercial fishery in Ireland. The county has seen a huge expansion in aquaculture which has caused division between the fisheries board and those who promote and support aquaculture. We also rely heavily on tourist angling revenue which amounts to more than £8 million per year. Everyone who is involved in the fishing sector should be involved in the board. That is why I welcome the expansion of the remit of the board and the inclusion of other elements such as tourism and fish farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that there is a local public representative, whether a town commissioner, urban councillor or county councillor, on each board. The link with local councils is vital. Recently in Donegal we had an opportunity to meet the fisheries board. The board has problems with water pollution and if there was a link between the board and an elected representative who could deal with the planning sections of the council we would not have as many problems as we have. The two greatest threats to our fisheries are water pollution and poaching. There have been great changes regarding these issues, but if we are to protect this valuable asset we need more fishery officers and more staff. The staffing level in the Northern Regional Fisheries Board, <Col N="1011" /> as I am sure in all others, is quite inadequate to develop and supervise the proposed management systems and to channel local support in promoting this very valuable asset.</P>
    <P>I represent all the factions involved in tourism. I live beside the Eany river where the Minister has provided funding for tremendous development and we look forward to seeing the benefit of that investment being reaped by the local anglers and foreign tourists. Co-operation is the key to the development of that fishery and that co-operation is also important for the commercial fishermen whom I represent, particularly the drift-net and draft-net fishermen, and the aquaculture industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister came to Ballyshannon a number of years ago and, with Lord Dubbs, announced an investment of £2 million in the Erne salmon management programme which was a wonderful concept. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that what was attempted in the Erne has not been successful. I hope that, in consultation with the ESB and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, we can address the serious problem of the lack of stocks in the Erne. In co-operation with the ESB, I hope we will see a return of fishing at Kathleen Falls, Cliff and in the Erne estuary. The fishery has gone and unless major work is carried out by the ESB it will not return. The members of the Northern Regional Fisheries Board are anxious to co-operate with the Northern Ireland authorities to address this problem.</P>
    <P>The principle of subsidiarity and local decision making is very important. Fishing is a huge national asset and I hope that the concerns expressed by many organisations will be considered on Committee Stage. The Minister has already adverted to many of these concerns. I look forward to the increased development of the inland fisheries. I know the Minister is capable of addressing this question and I am glad to note the support of all sides of the House. Mar fhocal scor, molaim an Bille.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The concerns expressed by anglers over the past few weeks have been diluted by the acceptance by the Minister of many of their suggested amendments. This was a prudent action by the Minister and is very welcome. We do not wish to see a repeat of what happened in the 1980s when the angling industry was disrupted and much damage was done to it. The angling fraternity throughout the world is closely knit and its members communicate with each other. At that time I met people outside the country who had heard of what they called the rod war in Ireland. This did great damage to Irish angling. I am glad the Minister acted sensibly on this occasion and intends to work closely with the various angling federations and the national anglers' <Col N="1012" /> association to ensure that this Bill will not lead to another rod war.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have heard the views of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board but I wish to repeat them to the House. I live on the bank of the River Feale in County Kerry which was once one of the top salmon fishing rivers in Europe. In the late 1950s and early 1960s thousands of tourists came to Finuge every year. The local public house is called The Anglers Rest. People now ask why it is called that because there are no longer anglers. It was called The Anglers Rest because that is where tourists came when they had finished their day's fishing. It was a very lucrative industry for local anglers who acted as ghillies, advisers to tourists and so on.</P>
      <P>I remember trying to fly fish on the banks of the Feale and one could hardly get room to cast a fly for two or three miles along the river because it was so popular. However, when one now passes over the new bridge one rarely sees a fisherman, except when the water is high or there is a run of white trout or pale salmon. That is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>Regardless of all the promotion the Minister does of Ireland as an angling destination, unless there are fish such as salmon and trout in the rivers, he will only discredit our tourism industry. For example, the River Feale is being sold at the moment in a very nice brochure which advertises facilities for tourists. Unfortunately, however, people are leaving very disappointed. Unless the Minister addresses the issues of restocking and the erosion of the wild salmon population, he will have a problem, as will the country, in the future. I would like to hear the Minister's views on how he proposes to bring the fish back into the rivers.</P>
      <P>I will refer to the River Feale because it is the one with which I am most familiar. There is a problem in that river with drift net fishing. Deputy Coughlan mentioned that drift net fishing is very important in Donegal and many people earn their livelihoods from it. However, if the drift net fishermen prevent salmon getting up the river they will not be there for anglers or draft net fishermen. There has been a tradition for generations on the Cashen, which is the estuary part of the Feale, and further up the river of draft net fishing. This should be preserved. However, neither the draft man nor the angler will be able to carry on if there is no supply of fish. I would like to hear the Minister's views on the impact of drift net fishing on salmon and sea trout. One does not want to upset the livelihoods of drift net fishermen. However, the kernel of the problem is striking a balance between that and ensuring a plentiful supply for anglers, draft men and the tourists we are trying to lure to our rivers, rather than sending them home disappointed. I have met these tourists and they go home very disappointed because they may not have caught even one salmon after one or two weeks. In many cases, they leave after a few days because they realise there are no fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> I would welcome the introduction of a national salmon tagging regime and also the establishment on a statutory basis of the National Salmon Commission. There must be a total focus on this. I have listened to people speaking on fishing who do not live near a river. They often speak from reports rather than practical first-hand experience.</P>
    <P>The angling clubs along the River Feale are the Finuge-Killocruin club, the Tralee and District Anglers Association and the North Kerry Anglers Association. They are all very good clubs. Under the last operational programme they received £20,000 to create pools to hold salmon rather than let them go up river at times of flooding and so on. They have been quite successful in doing that. They have been very well organised and have created some of the finest pools in the country. However, unfortunately, if there are no salmon coming up the river they will not be in the pools. These people are very concerned about the future of the industry in the River Feale. One of the main representatives, Mr. Joy, met the Minister last night in the Department, where he made the case for the national anglers. These are very sensible and responsible people.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has made a proposal, to which the Minister may respond in his reply, to defer the opening of the angling season on the River Feale from 1 March to 1 May. The River Feale anglers are opposed to that because it is a tradition that people come for that day from all over the country and abroad. It is a big day for anglers on the River Feale. The anglers have spent £12,000 employing their own private water keeper and have already put a range of voluntary conservation measures in place. The clubs I mentioned have about 150 adult members and are very disappointed they were not consulted by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board on this announcement.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board. The first relates to the composition of the board. At a recent meeting the board felt that, in view of its role in the protection and development of inland fisheries and sea angling, the present 16 elected categories should remain as constituted at present. On a geographical basis, the Shannon board is the largest in the country. Reducing the board to 16 members would not adequately represent all sections of the region. The reduction in the number of elected members will militate against the main thrust of the Bill, which is to move responsibility to a local level, involve those with an interest in fisheries development and conserve fisheries in a partnership manner. The representation of additional interests in the catchment should be by way of additional members to the board. Perhaps the Minister has already addressed that, given that he intends to change a number of provisions in the Bill. However, I would like him to refer to the concern of the board, which was communicated to him on 15 November.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> The members are strongly opposed to the proposal to nominate the board chairman. They believe the electoral system is more democratic and in line with the devolved structures. Given the number of appointments the Minister has to make to this board, I can see it becoming another political matter. He must be very careful. The people he will appoint to the board &ndash; this would also happen with a Fine Gael or Labour Minister &ndash; will be political appointees. Political activists will be queuing up to be on this board and it will be another way of repaying favours to political hacks. I advise the Minister to tread very carefully. When I was involved in setting up Leader boards around the country I was asked to include local council members, which I refrained from doing. I know this is a different area but I am drawing an analogy. The Leader II programme was free of the influence of politicians. The Leader programme was very successful as an instrument for local democracy and the bottom up approach. One of the reasons it was so successful and credible was that we did not have politicians manipulating the board and telling people that grants had been obtained for them.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that if the Minister nominates too many members the boards will be politicised and lose their independent focus. How does the Minister propose to make nominations? Will he nominate representatives of the various bodies involved who will act independently or will they be civil servants? It would be totally wrong for the Minister to nominate a chairperson as this would take away from the spirit of the Bill under which the regional fisheries boards will have enhanced powers. To maintain local democracy the boards should continue to elect their own chairpersons.</P>
    <P>To remove the right of share certificate holders to elect members to societies would represent a breach of the understanding reached on the formation of the co-operatives, the basis of which is democracy. The other changes proposed in the Bill however are welcome.</P>
    <P>The future of the life members of the former Inland Fisheries Trust is unclear. It would be a retrograde step if the Bill was to remove this category as it would result in the disenfranchisement of hundreds of anglers who have been committed to the fisheries service for many years.</P>
    <P>Since my re-election to the county council after a gap of four or five years I have noticed that a raft of legislation has been produced by the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Health and Children, among others, which imposes new responsibilities on councils without the provision of an additional budget. This Bill gives a unique opportunity to all those interested in inland fisheries to improve and develop the fisheries service. In the absence of a commitment to increase the available funding however, it cannot achieve the much needed change. From where should the money come? In what way can fees be collected? In the absence of <Col N="1015" /> a commitment to provide funding to implement its provisions the Bill will be less effective.</P>
    <P>It all comes down to the availability of fish. How does one ensure restocking? How does the Minister propose to ensure a balance between drift net and draft net fishermen and anglers?</P>
    <P>On pollution, although there has been a great improvement in water quality, the recent report on water quality is a source of concern. In this connection the large sums provided for in the national development plan for pollution control and, more importantly, sewage treatment should help to prevent eutrophication, which presents a major problem in towns like Killarney in terms of damage to fish stocks, especially in the upper reaches of rivers. Domestic sewage and effluent should be controlled as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Anglers are now very happy and the regional fisheries boards will be much happier if the Minister addresses some of the matters raised. I compliment Deputy Finucane on his fine contribution. It is obvious that he is taking his brief seriously and has a good understanding of this subject. I wish the Minister the best on this important Bill.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I welcome the Bill which gives us an opportunity to discuss the services provided by inland fisheries. The amendments the Minister proposes to make following his meetings with the various organisations involved should enhance the Bill and help to ensure co-ordination. The regional fisheries boards and some of the organisations involved were dissatisfied with the Bill as published.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to change the provisions dealing with representation and the election of chairpersons. He stated that the current levels of representation for salmon, trout and coarse anglers and life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust on the regional fisheries boards will be maintained. There is the perfect mix on the River Slaney as between rod and net fishermen who are continuously at war with each other. Draft net fishermen were of the view however, that they had been isolated by the Minister by the Bill as published. Salmon, trout and coarse anglers were each to have their own representative. If that were to happen they would vote down every proposal made by draft net fishermen. It is important therefore that their representation is maintained.</P>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider buying out draft net fishermen on the River Slaney. I first made this proposal on my election to this House 17 years ago. Deputy Andrews, when Minister for the Marine, thought strongly about it. Most of the draft net fishermen concerned &ndash; there are about 70 in total &ndash; are elderly and are anxious to be bought out. This has been done in a number of countries, including Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who will be responsible for cleaning rivers? Certain sections of the River Slaney badly need to be cleaned and dredged. The inland fisheries board and the county council have indicated that <Col N="1016" /> there are no funds available while the Office of Public Works has stated that it is not its responsibility. The matter should be clarified on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have an opportunity to deal with the matters raised in more detail on Committee Stage. Deputies Finucane and Bell dealt with the Bill comprehensively. Others dealt with various aspects of it. The question was asked why make the board tighter. We discussed this matter yesterday with angler interests. Everything is changing. We have talked about this for years. It is difficult to get people to agree to do it but we are making the change now. It is a substantial change which is almost unprecedented nationally. We have made the change in relation to the Moy, about which there was much argument and debate, but we pressed ahead and it is now under the control of the local interests. Everybody is happy with it now but we had great difficulty delivering it at the time.</P>
      <P>We are trying to meet the points raised by a number of Deputies, namely, to have more effective, better managed and more modern boards, to ensure our rivers are better cared for and that there are sufficient numbers of fish. This is a big business. Anglers are more like scientists. They have a great deal of knowledge about the rivers, nature and other environmental factors. In the past we did not marry that knowledge sufficiently with the business side of this industry in terms of the resources and structures that were needed. People come forward on a daily basis and claim they are doing okay but that they would like additional environmental officers and more environmental control, but to do that we have to become more sophisticated. We have to convince the public, and those who provide the various finances, that this is a vital national asset and must be treated as such.</P>
      <P>There are many stakeholders, as they are called now, with a special interest in this area and they must be represented also. The main thinking arising from the discussion was to move towards a more effective and tighter board and the establishment of committees. For the first time, the regional boards will be able to set up scientific and environmental committees and decide on their membership. That will be much better in the long run for everybody concerned. As these will be businesslike boards there was a desire to tighten them up in terms of numbers and have, say, 16 members representing farming, environmental and other interests as well as all the interests on the fishing side, with one member for each interest. The anglers were concerned, however, that the balance might be a little too even in that this was mainly a fishing asset, and I accept that. That is the reason I was prepared to increase the fisheries interests on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to have another talking shop; we have too many of those. That issue arose in the excellent discussion yesterday and I assured <Col N="1017" /> people that we would not have a talking shop. These people will be proper board members. They need not worry about somebody else making the decisions because power will be devolved to them to make the decisions. That is the kind of change that will take place.</P>
    <P>There is need for an understanding of what that means in terms of the way in which these boards are run. My officials and I have worked hard to obtain funding from the national plan for this area. We succeeded in getting £24 million and the boards, if they are set up, can start work from 1 January 2000, otherwise the decisions will be taken centrally as they have been up to now. The purpose of the Bill is to give these boards the power to make their own decisions.</P>
    <P>I realise there are difficulties in terms of funding, and that approximately £16 million per annum has been paid already to the boards, but there is a need to highlight what needs to be done and the additional resources that are needed, and we can make progress on that as we move ahead. The £24 million is for the type of development work in which the clubs, co-operatives and boards want to be involved.</P>
    <P>This is a different kind of board. That is the reason we are keeping the numbers tight while having all interests represented. Those interests made representations to me, as well as NARA, FISSTA and TAFI. We told them what we are doing &ndash; I have put that on the record &ndash; and we are proceeding on that basis. We will have to see how we can manage that. I accept people have concerns and we want to address those fears and move on in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>Various issues were raised in the debate. Deputy Stagg praised the work done by Deputy Gilmore when he was Minister of State. I agree that Deputy Gilmore was a good Minister who applied himself well and did much work in this area. We have been carrying on that work and developing it even further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell wants to have one staff member on the Central Fisheries Board. We have staff members on the regional boards and I do not see any problem in providing for that.</P>
    <P>Other speakers talked about appointing the chairpersons of the individual boards. I could appoint them, as Minister, but there is no need to go into that in any great detail at this stage. I just want to reply to Deputy Bell in particular on that point.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy John Browne on being appointed chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which will deal with the Bill next week. Deputy Browne also called for the balance to be maintained on the board and I am sure we can meet his wish in that regard.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about tagging. That will be a matter for the salmon commission and there will be much consultation on the issue. We have received the nominations for the salmon commission from the anglers. I will appoint those <Col N="1018" /> people and we will get on with that work as soon as the legislation is ready.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problems in the Killarney catchment, which were raised again yesterday when I met the anglers. I have asked my Department to consult urgently with the board, the anglers and the catchment management facilitator to sort out the problems.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill has its origins in the Agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations on Northern Ireland &ndash; the Good Friday Agreement. Under the section of the Agreement headed &ldquo;Rights, Safeguards, and Equality of Opportunity&rdquo;, the Government is obliged to take a number of comparable steps to further strengthen the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction. One of those steps is the establishment of a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which commenced operation on 1 March 1999. The purpose of the Bill before the House, therefore, is to give effect to that commitment and to provide for the setting up of a Human Rights Commission in the State which will, as the Taoiseach stated, be a model of its kind and which will set, rather than follow, standards of best international practice in this field.</P>
      <P>The establishment of human rights commissions in various countries is a relatively modern development. As it happens, the Northern Ireland commission is the first of its kind in western Europe, although similar bodies exist in other parts of the world, notably in Canada, Mexico, South Africa, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. It is easy to think of such institutions in the context of emerging democracies, particularly in countries where there has been a history of civil unrest and social upheaval as in some south African countries, including South Africa itself. In this context, human rights commissions play an important role in the development of a human rights ethos which is particularly significant in societies which are deeply divided along political, religious, racial or cultural lines.</P>
      <P>However, human rights commissions are also part of the settled landscape in countries with well-established and stable democracies, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It is now well accepted in most common law countries that human rights commissions with a specific role to monitor and assist in the promotion and protection of human rights are necessary institutions, alongside ombudsmen and anti-discrimination and pro-equality agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In framing the proposals which essentially led to the drawing up of the Good Friday Agreement, the question of providing for human rights commissions in both parts of the island was of <Col N="1020" /> particular relevance. The drafters had a considerable body of background work and development to draw upon. The idea that states should create official human rights commissions with powers to act independently of Government was considered at international level and had been given support by the principles relating to the status of national institutions &ndash; the Paris Principles &ndash; adopted at the first international workshop on national institutions in Paris, 1991, and by the UN General Assembly in 1993. These principles leave a good deal of discretion to states with regard to the precise competence and powers of human rights commissions, but underscore the requirement that they should have as broad a mandate as possible &ldquo;to promote and protect human rights&rdquo;, including the power to make recommendations to Government and to investigate and report on general and specific violations. They also emphasise that such commissions should be independent of Government, should be pluralist and representative of society as a whole and should have adequate funding so as not to be subject to any Government or financial control which might affect that independence.</P>
    <P>Closer to home, further attention was devoted to the establishment of human rights commissions in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which commissioned and published a consultancy study on the protection of human rights in the context of peace and reconciliation in Ireland. In its 1996 report, the Constitution Review Group also recommended that a human rights commission should be established in the State to maintain an overview of the extent to which human rights are protected at constitutional and legal levels, to assess the adequacy of this protection and to make recommendations to Government for the better protection of these rights, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>It was also the preferred view of the review group that such a commission should have a legislative rather than a constitutional status, at least in the shorter term, but that if it performed well over a number of years, the desirability of affording it such a status should be further considered. The report also suggested that the commission might engage in empirical and other research, and perhaps consult with the public before making any specific recommendations for change. Significantly, the report did not go so far as to recommend that the commission should have an adjudicative role, suggesting instead that complaints of human rights violations should continue to be determined by the courts. The group also felt that consideration should be given to permitting the commission to take constitutional actions on behalf of individual citizens or the public at large, in appropriate circumstances, and that it should have the power to act as <i>amicus curiae</i>&ndash; expert adviser to a court &ndash; in constitutional cases involving human rights issues. The group did not envisage that the commission would have the power to vet proposed legislation for compatibility with the Constitution, a role currently fulfilled by the Attorney General and his office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> That is the background to the proposals which are contained in the Human Rights Commission Bill, 1999. However, the proposals in the Bill also draw on a widespread consultation process. The general scheme of the Bill was laid before the Oireachtas and was considered in turn by the All-party Committee on the Constitution and the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. The text of the scheme was also considered in detail by a number of groups and non-governmental organisations operating in the human rights area generally. I wish to acknowledge the valuable work and contributions of these bodies in making submissions to my Department and meeting with officials to discuss and express their views on the proposals. Chief among those groups were the free legal advice centres, the Irish Council of Civil Liberties, the Combat Poverty Agency, Amnesty International, the Pavee Point Travellers Centre, the National Consultative Committee on Racism and lnterculturalism and the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas. We have also taken account of the views of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as valuable contacts with the special adviser for national human rights institutions in that office, and distinguished members of the Australian and New Zealand Human Rights Commissions.</P>
    <P>Our proposals and those which culminated in the setting up of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission under the relevant provisions of the Northern Ireland Act, 1998, were also discussed with our British and Northern Ireland counterparts. I acknowledge the expert help and generous assistance of one of the senior British officials involved in the area of equality and human rights in the context of Northern Ireland, Mr. Tony Beeton, who was so tragically killed in the recent Paddington rail crash and to extend my condolences to his wife and family.</P>
    <P>Given the Government's commitment to equivalence with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, I would like to refer briefly to the legislative provisions outlined in the Northern Ireland Act, 1998, which relate to it. The Northern Ireland commission, which came into existence on 1 March 1999, has ten members, including a chief commissioner, all of whom have been appointed initially for a term of three years, and it is expressed to be representative of the community in Northern Ireland. It is independent of Government and has a vastly extended role beyond that exercised by the former Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights, the body which preceded it. For the information of the House, the chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland commission is Professor Brice Dickson, formerly a professor of law at the University of Ulster. The nine other commissioners who work part time for the commission are: Ms Christine Bell, professor of law-elect at Magee College, University of Ulster, Ms Margaret Ann Dinsmore, QC, practising barrister, Mr. Tom Donnelly, MBE, a businessman, the Rev. Harold <Col N="1022" /> Good, a Methodist minister, Professor Tom Hadden, professor of law at Queen's University, Ms Patricia Kelly, director of the Children's Law Centre, Ms Angela Hegarty, lecturer in law at Magee College, University of Ulster, Ms lnez McCormack, regional secretary of UNISON and president of ICTU, and Mr. Frank McGuinness, Northern Ireland director of Trócaire.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Northern Ireland commission are to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness in Northern Ireland of law and practice relating to human rights; to advise the Secretary of State and the executive committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly of legislative and other measures which ought to be taken to protect human rights; to advise the Northern Ireland Assembly whether a Bill is compatible with human rights; to provide advice for the Secretary of State on the scope for defining in Westminster legislation rights supplementary to those in the European Convention on Human Rights, such legislation when taken together with the European convention to be called a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland; to promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights in Northern Ireland by, for example, undertaking, commissioning or otherwise assisting research and educational activities; to do all that it can to ensure the establishment of a joint committee with the Human Rights Commission in the State; and to make to the Secretary of State within two years such recommendations as the commission thinks fit for improving its effectiveness. In addition, the Northern Ireland commission has four important powers: to give assistance to individuals who apply to it for help in relation to proceedings which involve law or practice concerning the protection of human rights; to bring proceedings itself which involve law or practice concerning the protection of human rights; to conduct such investigations as it considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of exercising its other functions; and to publish its advice and the outcome of its research and investigations.</P>
    <P>As will be seen, my proposals for a commission in this jurisdiction provide that it will have a mandate and remit at the very least equivalent to that of the Northern Ireland commission and in so doing fully meets the Government's commitment in this regard under the Agreement. I shall deal with this matter in greater detail later on.</P>
    <P>At this point I will turn to the Bill and go through its principal features in a general way. Section 1 sets out the various definitions used in the Bill and is a common and unexceptional provision.</P>
    <P>Section 2 defines &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; as the rights, liberties and freedoms conferred on or guaranteed to persons by the Constitution and any agreement, treaty or convention to which the State is a party. This means that the commission will not just be concerned with fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, which are of considerable importance, but with those rights <Col N="1023" /> contained in all the agreements, treaties and conventions to which the State is a party. This gives the commission a very wide remit indeed and means that it can base its operations on a foundation which comprises not just the Convention on Human Rights but all other modern human rights norms. As an indication of just how wide the commission's remit will be, I have circulated for the information of Deputies a list of the human rights instruments to which the State is already a party and those which it expects to take on board in the near future.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the Minister to appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Bill. Section 4 provides for the establishment of a Human Rights Commission which will be independent in the exercise of its functions. This is the statutory guarantee of that independence.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the commission will consist of a president and eight other members. The members, who will be appointed by the Government, will be selected on the basis of possessing such relevant experience, qualifications, training or expertise as in the opinion of the Government is appropriate having particular regard to the functions of the commission. Members will hold office for a period not exceeding five years and will be eligible for re-appointment for a further term not exceeding five years. The section also sets out the provisions to be followed in the event that a person who holds judicial office in the superior courts is appointed president of the commission. The Bill differs from the general scheme in this respect in that a judicial appointment for the presidency of the commission is now an option, not a requirement. Subsections (4) and (5) of this section are technical and consequential provisions in the event that the Government decides to appoint a judge as president of the commission.</P>
    <P>The qualifying criteria applicable to the members of the commission are widely drawn so as to embrace the whole range of persons who may have experience in the area covered by the Human Rights Commission. In this regard, the Paris Principles, to which I have already referred, emphasise the importance of pluralism in the composition of human rights commissions. They suggest that representatives from non-governmental organisations, trade unions, professional organisations and trends in social and religious thought, and possibly parliamentary or Government officials, could be appointed to such bodies. In the case of the latter two categories their appointment would be in an advisory or observational capacity only. It is clear that the overriding consideration is that appointees should have strong human rights credentials and be persons of integrity, experience, imagination and commitment. It goes without saying that the Government intends to consult as widely as possible with interested organisations in the matter of potential nominees. The composition of the commission <Col N="1024" /> will be crucial to its credibility and ultimately its success. The Government will take great pains to ensure that it gets this right.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of this, section 5(11) provides that the Government in making appointments under this section must have regard to the need to ensure that the membership of the commission includes both men and women and broadly reflects the nature of Irish society. I should, perhaps, say at this stage that it is not proposed to appoint Members of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament to the commission. First, the number of commissioners is relatively small given the range of duties that it will have to perform. Second, it would be necessary to give appointees in this category a limited role. There is a real possibility that membership of the commission could involve a possible conflict of interest with parliamentary work at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that where the number of ordinary judges of the High Court or Supreme Court fails to be determined for the purpose of any enactment which makes provision with respect to the number of such judges, the operation of section 5(5) of the Bill, which provides that where a person who holds judicial office is appointed as president of the commission the number of ordinary judges may be exceeded by one, shall be taken account of in making that determination. This is a technical provision and is applicable only in the event that the Government decides to appoint a judge of the superior courts to be president of the commission. As I have already said, the Bill allows the Government to appoint the president of the commission from as wide a pool of candidates as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is in the usual format and provides that where a commission member, including the president, is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, elected as a member of either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Parliament, they will cease to be a member of the commission. In addition, a member of the commission will be disqualified from holding office if he or she is adjudged bankrupt or convicted on indictment and sentenced to imprisonment. The Government may dismiss a member of the commission if he or she has without reasonable excuse failed to discharge his or her function for a continuous period of three months, been convicted of a criminal offence, is unfit to carry out his or her function or for any other stated reason.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the functions of the Human Rights Commission and as such is the core provision in the Bill. In this regard, I propose to give the Human Rights Commission as wide a remit as possible in keeping with the Government's commitment to equivalence with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission as stipulated in the Good Friday Agreement. As I have already mentioned, my proposals are fully in keeping with the Government's obligations under the Agreement and as far as possible meet <Col N="1025" /> the criteria for national human rights institutions as set out in the Paris Principles.</P>
    <P>The main functions of the commission will be to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights, to consult national and international bodies as it sees fit, to make recommendations to Government either of its own volition or on request on measures to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights in the State, to promote understanding and awareness of the importance of human rights and for those purposes to undertake or sponsor research and educational activities, to conduct inquiries as it considers necessary or expedient, to prepare and publish reports on any research or inquiries conducted by it, to appear as <i>amicus curiae</i> on application to the High Court or the Supreme Court in proceedings before those courts that involve or concern human rights, to establish and participate in the joint North-South committee of representatives drawn from the commissions in both jurisdictions, to provide legal and other assistance and to institute proceedings for the purpose of obtaining relief of a declaratory or other nature in respect of any matter concerning the human rights of any person or class of persons.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of conducting inquiries I am proposing to give the commission specific powers to obtain information and documents relevant to the matter being inquired into. This step is indicative of the Government's commitment to give the commission a powerful and independent pro-active role in relation to the defence of human rights. While the Northern Ireland Act gives the Northern Ireland commission powers of investigation, it does not yet have the ancillary power to compel witnesses to attend before it or produce books, documents or other evidence. However, I am sure this matter will receive further attention in the context of the two year review of the commission's work. In this respect, the requirement of equivalence for both commissions as set out in the Good Friday Agreement will be exceeded in this jurisdiction. However, as I have already indicated, I am of the view that the Agreement represents the minimum required. I shall set out these inquiry powers when I come to section 9.</P>
    <P>I propose that the commission be given the role of <i>amicus curiae</i> in human rights litigation in constitutional cases in the superior courts. <i>Amicus curiae</i> means literally &ldquo;a friend of the court&rdquo;, and the provision will allow the commission to appear before a court in proceedings where the court may find the commission's knowledge and expertise useful. I propose to allow the commission to apply to the High Court or the Supreme Court for liberty to appear before the court. Such appearance, however, will always be at the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>In this regard, my thinking has been influenced by the comments of the Constitution Review Group in its 1996 report that consideration might <Col N="1026" /> be given to conferring such a role upon the commission. I have also noted that, while the legislation setting up the Northern Ireland commission does not specifically provide that it can intervene in human rights cases before the courts as an <i>amicus curiae</i>, the commission has interpreted its powers as meaning that it can prepare such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the commission may conduct an inquiry at its own volition if it considers it necessary or expedient to do so for the purpose of the performance of any of its functions under section 8 or, subject to certain conditions, at the request of any person. The section also confers on the commission a specific power to require the production of documents or information, supported if necessary by a Circuit Court order, with necessary safeguards for legal professional privilege and incrimination. Provision is being made that the inquiry may be conducted in public or in private as the commission, at its discretion, considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that the commission can decide not to conduct an inquiry, or discontinue an inquiry which has commenced where the matter concerned is trivial, vexatious or manifestly unfounded, the person making the request has an insufficient interest in the matter, or the matter concerned could be more appropriately dealt with by the institution of legal proceedings or the making of an application to a tribunal or other person in whom are vested powers to award redress or grant relief in respect of the matter.</P>
    <P>A relevant consideration at this point is a complaint relating to discrimination or an issue of equality. I recently brought the provisions of the 1998 Employment Equality Act into operation, and the provisions of the Equal Status Bill should be enacted in the new year. The Equality Agency and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations have extensive powers to deal with cases of this type. It makes no sense for the Human Rights Commission to conduct parallel inquiries in the same area. Similarly, where a disputed matter involves an area covered by the Ombudsman, the Information Commissioner, the Data Protection Commissioner or the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, the intention is that the Human Rights Commission will refer the applicant to the appropriate statutory agency.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that a person can apply to the commission for legal or other assistance regarding proceedings involving law or practice relating to the protection of human rights. The assistance could be in the form of the provision of legal advice, legal representation or such other assistance as the commission deems appropriate. The commission can decide to provide assistance on the following grounds: that the matter raises a question of principle, that it would be unreasonable to expect the person to deal with the matter concerned without assistance because of its com<Col N="1027" /> plexity or for any other reason, or that there are special circumstances which make it appropriate for the commission to grant such assistance. The commission may decide not to grant assistance where the assistance sought could be obtained under existing legal aid schemes, or powers to award redress or grant relief in the matter to which the proceedings relate stand vested in any tribunal or other person and the matter could, in the opinion of the commission, be more effectively or conveniently dealt with by that tribunal or other person.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that the commission may institute proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining relief of a declaratory or other nature in respect of any matter concerning the human rights of any person or class of persons. For the purposes of this section, &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; is defined as the:</P>
    <P>rights, liberties, and freedoms conferred on, or guaranteed to, persons by the Constitution and as the rights, liberties and freedoms conferred on, or guaranteed to, persons by any agreement, treaty or convention to which the State is a party and which has been given the force of law in the State or by a provision of any such agreement, treaty or convention which has been given such force.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, for the purposes of this section it has been necessary to formulate a definition of human rights which is more restrictive than the definition set out in section 2. This is because declaratory relief can only be sought for provisions which have force of law in the State. In this respect, and as I have already mentioned in the case of the Convention on Human Rights, it is not sufficient for Ireland to be a party to an international instrument, we must also have incorporated the relevant provisions into our domestic law in accordance with our constitutional requirements. If, subsequent to the enactment of this Bill, we incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into our law, the convention will then be covered by the definition in section 11 and, accordingly, the relevant provision in the convention may then be relied on in cases before the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 provide that there will be a chief executive of the commission who will manage and control generally the staff, administration and business of the commission. The chief executive will be responsible to the commission for the performance of his or her functions and the implementation of the commission's policies. I regard this type of appointment as absolutely essential for the proper and efficient operation and day to day management of the commission. Section 14 provides that the chief executive will, whenever required to do so by the Committee of Public Accounts, give evidence on the financial <Col N="1028" /> transactions etc. of the commission. Section 15 provides that the chief executive will also attend before any other committee of the Oireachtas to give account for the general administration of the commission. The chief executive will not, however, be required to give account before a committee for any matter which is, has been or may in future be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the keeping of accounts by the commission. Section 17 provides for the appointment of staff, and section 18 provides for the remuneration of such staff. Section 19 provides for the performance of the commission's functions by any member of staff duly authorised. Section 20 provides for the superannuation of staff. Section 21 provides for a seal of the commission. Section 22 provides for the payment of a grant to the commission. As a matter of administrative convenience and to comply with Government accounting instructions and procedures, it is proposed to channel the grant payable to the commission through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Section 23 provides for the commission to publish an annual report.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides for a review of the effectiveness of the commission within two years of establishment. There is a similar provision in the case of the Northern Ireland commission. It should be noted that the initiative in this regard is vested in the commission, not the Government. The purpose behind the provision is to allow any adjustment to be made in the provisions governing the commission's remit and functions in the light of a reasonable period of operation having elapsed.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill, as sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 26 provides that the Bill may be cited as the Human Rights Commission Act, 1999.</P>
    <P>The Bill I have set out is the product of a great deal of consideration and consultation. As I have already mentioned, it is a better Bill because of this. This is an appropriate point to comment on other separate, but related matters in this area of the Agreement where the Government is also obliged to take action. Chief among them is the introduction of measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights, taking into account the work of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the report of the Constitution Review Group which was published in 1996. These proposals are to draw on the European Convention on Human Rights as well as other international legal instruments in the field of human rights. The question of incorporation of the convention into Irish law is to be further examined in this context. Obviously any change in the position of the convention will have an important bearing on the <Col N="1029" /> work of the Human Rights Commission. This matter has been the subject of an indepth study in my Department over the past year or so. A committee of officials from the relevant Departments, including the Attorney General's office, have considered the various options which may be open to us in this regard. The matter is a complex one, raising difficult constitutional, legal and technical questions.</P>
    <P>The 1950 Convention on Human Rights drawn up by the Council of Europe may be regarded as one of the main foundation texts in international human rights law. The others are the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989. In addition, there are many other treaties or conventions dealing with a wide range of issues, such as torture, discrimination against women or members of ethnic groups, as well as a large number of declarations and resolutions issued by the UN and the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The nub of the matter is that while this State was one of the first countries to sign and ratify the convention almost 50 years ago and was also one of the first to allow its citizens the right of individual petition to the Court of Human Rights, the convention is law for Ireland only on the international plain. This means we are bound in international law to abide by the decisions of the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Acting Chairman and Members for allowing me to conclude.</P>
      <P>The convention, however, for constitutional reasons, most notably connected with Article 15 which reserves the sole and exclusive power of making laws to the Oireachtas alone and Article 29 which provides that no international agreement shall be part of the law of the State, save as may be determined by the Oireachtas, is not actually part of the law of the State. Accordingly, its provisions cannot be pleaded before domestic courts and persons seeking remedies under its provisions must first exhaust all domestic legal remedies before then taking their case to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. This can be a lengthy and expensive exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, the position can be summarised thus: the convention is law for Ireland, but not directly in Ireland. The effect of this is that decisions relating to the precise means by which the decision of the court is to be given effect are in the hands of the Government or the Oireachtas. Most commonly, this will take the form of amending legislation as, for instance, in <Col N="1030" /> the case of the repeal of certain provisions which criminalised homosexual conduct. Sometimes the change required can be of a lower order such as an amendment to administrative procedures or practices.</P>
    <P>The arguments against direct incorporation of the convention in the text of the Constitution are cogently and persuasively set out in the 1996 report of the Constitution Review Group which noted that such a move would diminish some rights in the Constitution on personal liberty, equality before the law and the rights of children, as well as creating gaps in other areas, such as the right to jury trial and the guarantee that the State should not endow religion. The review group considered instead that it would be preferable to build on and improve the existing fundamental rights provisions of the Constitution, including, where necessary, liberally drawing on some of the convention's text for this purpose rather than opting for direct incorporation of the convention.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from all of this that while the issues relating to the establishment of the Human Rights Commission and consideration of the question of incorporation of the Convention on Human Rights are related, they require separate and detailed consideration. That is the main reason it has not been possible to deal with both matters in the one Bill as the Labour Party Private Members' Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>However, incorporation of the convention by means of legislation could still be an option, though this solution has its own difficulties which should not be minimised. My feeling in the matter is that it is difficult to justify a situation where we alone, out of 41 contracting states of the Council of Europe, have not incorporated the convention into our law in some shape or form. Other countries with constitutional difficulties similar to our own have found a means of doing so, including most recently the United Kingdom and Norway. As a result of the committee's work in the area and, as soon as I have completed the process of consulting with other Departments in the matter, I hope to bring proposals to the Government consistent with our obligations under the Agreement in this regard. The timing of the matter is appropriate as Ireland has just taken over the political leadership of the Council of Europe for the next six months for the sixth time since 1949.</P>
    <P>The Agreement also obliges the Government to take action in a number of other human rights related areas and the Government has, as promised, ratified the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities. It has also implemented enhanced employment equality legislation through the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which I brought into effect on 18 October last. The new Equality Authority and the Director of Equality Investigations formally commenced operations on that day. In so far as discrimination in areas not related to employment is concerned, it is the Government's intention that <Col N="1031" /> the new equal status legislation will be brought into operation in the first half of the new year. The House will appreciate the reasons for this slight diversion from the matter in hand and will understand my desire to give as full a picture as possible of these very important and connected developments.</P>
    <P>To return to the provisions of the Bill now before the House, the Human Rights Commission Bill, when enacted, will form an important part of our constitutional and legal landscape and will ensure that fundamental rights and freedoms based on the Constitution and internationally recognised human rights norms are developed and applied throughout the State. The interplay between the Human Rights Commission and its counterpart in Northern Ireland, through a committee of joint representatives is a most significant development, which will lead, as the Agreement puts it, to &ldquo;the possibility of establishing a charter, open to signature by all democratic political parties, reflecting and endorsing agreed measures of protection of the fundamental rights of everyone living in the island of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Human rights have always been regarded by states as their own preserve over which they tend to be extremely sensitive and vigilant, since they involve many aspects &ndash; economic, social and cultural &ndash; of the life of the country. As relations between states have developed, it has been possible to move recognition for fundamental rights out of the national arena and on to the international stage through the adoption of various international instruments. However, the issue of human rights is about much more than law in the pure legal sense. As a concept, it has more to do with the natural law, it is transcendent. Human rights are not just what international rules in conventions, treaties or agreements say they are. They are what humans are entitled to as humans and the natural consequence of that is how we regard and treat each other as human beings irrespective of the social, cultural or religious environment in which we live. In this respect, the Leader of the Labour Party last night stated in this House that it was a matter of concern to him that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, from the security of south Kerry, said the country was being swamped by asylum seekers&mdash;</P>

      <P>It follows that the duty of upholding human rights is not one that belongs to the State alone. The State may be regarded as the leading and ultimate guardian because of its powerful and influential role which society has bestowed upon it. However, that is to ignore the duties and responsibilities placed on other organisations such as large multinational companies, the churches, the media, political parties and community groups, employers and trade unions right down to the level of the individual.</P>
      <P>I commend this Bill to the House and look forward to an interesting and worthwhile debate on its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. It was not clear until approximately 8.50 p.m. last night who would introduce the Bill on the Government's behalf. The Minister held on to his job due to the votes of four independent Deputies.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons this House had a difficulty with the Minister's stewardship arose from a feeling that he was not on top of things and one of the reasons for that may be the sheer volume of work which passes through his Department at any given time and the huge changes visited upon the Department in recent years which have not been properly dealt with.</P>
      <P>I will continue to bemoan the abolition by this Government of the highly successful Department of Equality and Law Reform, established in the early 1990s, and I commend the performance of the only holder of ministerial office in that Department in the history of the State, former Deputy Taylor. The Minister would not be experiencing the current difficulties if we had a Department of Equality and Law Reform dealing with civil law separate and distinct from a Department of Justice dealing with, among other things, criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about the State's obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and the various EU and UN conventions. We have been tardy in incorporating them into our legislation because we have regarded these matters as less than pressing. I am not saying it is the fault of the Minister, but the climate in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not allow for the priority and detailed con<Col N="1033" /> sideration to be given to the many important UN and EU conventions and declarations which we, as a State, signalled our intention to ratify years ago but have not exhibited the appropriate level of political will to do so. The Department of Equality and Law Reform must be reconstituted, if not by the current Government &ndash; I know it will not do so &ndash; by a future Government which will separate the Department into two component parts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the Minister circulated the heads of the Bill at committee level prior to its publication. We experienced an example of the committee system working well, in the way which was intended in the early 1990s when we expanded and developed the system. It accords a modicum of primacy of the Parliament over the Executive, something which was designed in our Constitution but which we neglected over the years. One of the reasons for the increasing irrelevance of this Chamber of Deputies is that for too long the practice of this Parliament acting as a mere rubber stamp in terms of implementing items brought forward by the Executive has been defended and tolerated.</P>
    <P>The committee dealt extensively with the heads of the Bill and, as the Minister said, heard submissions over a lengthy period. A considerable number of groups were invited to make both written and oral submissions. I have no doubt, as the Minister conceded, that the Bill is all the better of that. It is important the Department does not treat the Human Rights Commission Bill in isolation and that the heads of other legislation will be submitted to the committee before a Bill is given a Second Reading in the House. This is an example of the committee system playing a vibrant and active part in our democratic process.</P>
    <P>The decision to introduce this legislation arises from the commitments we entered into in the Good Friday Agreement signed in Belfast on 10 April last year. Under the Agreement we committed ourselves to a variety of measures to further strengthen the protection of human rights in our jurisdiction. We committed ourselves to the establishment of a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland. We committed ourselves to proceeding with arrangements as quickly as possible to ratify the Council of Europe Framework Convention on National Minorities, which I do not believe we have done yet.</P>
    <P>We committed ourselves to the implementation of enhanced employment equality legislation which, as the Minister said, we have recently done. We committed ourselves to the introduction of equal status legislation, which we hope to do at some stage in the future. We committed ourselves to continue to take further active steps to demonstrate our respect for the different traditions on the island of Ireland. We committed ourselves to the further examination of the possibility of incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into our legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> While the immediate momentum for this legislation derives from the Good Friday Agreement, the need for a Human Rights Commission is all the more urgent given the present controversy surrounding refugees. Ireland is undergoing a rapid social, economic and culture transformation. Some 25 years ago we were a relatively poor country. We were an insular and homogenous society on the Atlantic edge of Europe. The changes now taking place are transforming this country into a prosperous multicultural society, an active participant in the leading technologies of the global information society.</P>
    <P>One of the most important challenges facing us as a society is the establishment of agreed value systems which will be a guide to social relationships in an increasingly diverse and complex society. One of the value systems must be an enthusiastic and wholehearted commitment to a culture of human rights. That is why the broad thrust of this Bill is welcome. An active and independent Human Rights Commission is a fundamental element of a broadly based human rights culture.</P>
    <P>Fundamental rights already have substantial protection under the Constitution. We have an impressive body of case law developed over the years by our courts, particularly over the past 25 years. As regards incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into our domestic law, the Government should be favourably disposed to such a development. The 1996 Constitution Review Group, as mentioned by the Minister, recommended against incorporating the convention, largely on the basis that the Constitution gives stronger protection in some areas of fundamental rights than the European convention. It feared that replacing the fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution by the European convention might weaken protection in some areas.</P>
    <P>The concerns of the review group could be overcome by adopting the Swedish model of incorporating the convention into law. The amendment to the Swedish constitution, which facilitated the incorporation of the convention into Swedish law, took place in January 1995. It simply states that no law or other regulation may be enacted contrary to Sweden's obligations as follow from the European Convention on Human Rights. We should look at a simple constitutional change to that effect which would allow us to proceed with the convention. A similar article in the Constitution would allow Irish case law and precedent to remain largely in tact. A constitutional amendment like the Swedish model would also be very similar to Article 29.4.5 which governs our membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law would bring enormous benefits. The rights of the individual would be additionally protected. Parties to litigation concerning human rights would be able to invoke the convention and cite decisions of the European Court of Human Rights as direct pre<Col N="1035" /> cedents in Irish courts. Incorporation would involve an increased awareness of and respect for human rights among the public, the Judiciary, lawyers and those involved in the preparation of legislation. Incorporation would be in line with the general trend in Europe. We have much to learn from the Good Friday Agreement other than the incorporation of a Human Rights Commission into our legislation. It is important that we continue to be mindful of the human rights section of the Good Friday Agreement which is strong and worth bearing in mind at all times. The commission will deal with the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens under our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Only this morning a committee of this House had the opportunity to hear a submission from and listen to the experiences of the victims of the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings &ndash; the forgotten people. This is something which should be taken on board by the Government and the Minister by way of a public inquiry. The human rights section of the Good Friday Agreement is followed by a section on victims. It is vitally important that a proactive role is taken by the Government in the area of victims. I acknowledge the report of the Victims Commission under the chairmanship of former Tánaiste, John Wilson. It has done a good job and published a good report, but we have seen no great commitment on the part of the Government to this area. Given that we are on the eve of the budget, the Minister for Finance should make a sum of £10 million per annum available for three to four years to help victim support groups here and in Northern Ireland. It is a small amount of money given the effect it could have on the victims of three decades of violence on this island.</P>
    <P>Last December, on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Taoiseach committed himself to setting up a Human Rights Commission which would be a model of its kind in Europe. The objective was to take the UN-Paris Principles guiding the establishment of a Human Rights Commission and to set, but not to follow, standards of international best practice in the field. I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform return to do this during their tenure.</P>
    <P>In his response the Minister should outline the nature of the discussion and correspondence between his Department and any other Department or the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on this issue. The Minister said that for the first time we have a person in very high office in that area. I would have thought there would be extensive discussions, briefings and correspondence during the drafting of this Bill. Was the Bill submitted to that UN office while in draft form and what, if any, was the response? The Minister should inform us of the level of consultation with countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Canada, <Col N="1036" /> all of which have human rights commissions and similar legislative provisions to ours.</P>
    <P>It appears from the Bill that the Government may be predisposed towards appointing a senior judicial figure as president of this commission. In considering this appointment the Government should give particular thought to the proposed appointee's record in the human rights area. Judicial experience alone should not be the determining factor. We should look for someone with direct experience in the area prior to making an appointment. That should be the most influential factor in making the appointment. I fail to see why Deputies and Senators should be automatically excluded by legislation from membership of the proposed commission. The UN guidelines on the composition of such commissions specifically mention parliamentarians as a category to be considered. I do not accept the Minister's argument that there might be a conflict of interest, that politicians might not be suitable or that this is an area into which sitting Members of either House should not tread.</P>
    <P>This seems to be broadly similar to an attitude of Governments since the foundation of the State that, for example, no former parliamentarian, irrespective of experience, is considered suitable to act as an ambassador for the State. Why has that been the case? It is because of tradition or convention, though there are many Deputies, from all sides of the House, who have served their constituencies, country and Parliament well and who would be ideal candidates for ambassadorships. Yet our tradition has been that this is a matter entirely within the domain of the Department of Foreign Affairs, with few exceptions over the years. The Minister may be excluding parliamentarians from this body without giving the matter sufficient thought and we can return to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The UN guidelines also recommend that national institutions shall examine the legislation and administrative provisions in force as well as Bills and proposals and shall make recommendations as it deems appropriate in order to ensure that these provisions conform to the fundamental principles of human rights. This Bill does not propose that the commission be given the right to examine proposed legislation to ascertain its compliance with international treaties to which the State is a party. At a minimum, the Bill should include a provision to allow the Minister of the day to refer proposed legislation to the commission for consideration. The Australian legislation in 1986 established a human rights commission there and it contains such a provision. The commission should also be given specific responsibility to carry out a human rights audit of Acts and regulations within a three year timetable. The Minister should also look at the New Zealand Human Rights Act, 1993, which obliged its commission to carry out a human rights audit of New Zealand laws and regulations. The New Zealand commission also has the power &ldquo;to make public statements in relation to any group of per<Col N="1037" /> sons in, or who may be coming to, New Zealand or who may be subject to hostility, or who have been or who may be brought into contempt on the basis that that group consists of persons against whom discrimination is unlawful&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Human Rights Commission we propose to enact should be given this specific responsibility. It would have plenty to say about the treatment of refugees and travellers, for example. We recently had a debate on refugees and it is extraordinary that neither the Minister nor his predecessors have introduced appropriate legislation to ratify the UN convention on racial hatred. It has been ratified by 155 countries worldwide and we are the only EU state not to have done so. That is indicative of a mindset in certain areas that needs changing.</P>
    <P>I hope the new commission will urgently examine our legislation and regulations regarding the committal and continuing detention and care of those who are mentally ill. There is fairly compelling evidence that the basic human rights of the mentally ill are constantly being infringed in this jurisdiction. It is also high time the State answers the strong human rights case regarding the care we provide for the physically and mentally handicapped. The Belfast agreement commits the Government to setting up a joint committee of the two Human Rights Commissions, North and South, as a forum for consideration of human rights issues on the island of Ireland. There is still a strong culture of political violence on this island, and punishment beatings, paramilitary-style shootings and the exiling of people are a manifestation of that culture. Hopefully the executive political institutions will be established in Northern Ireland next week. With devolution in operation it will be possible for all political parties on our island to co-operate together in order to establish and endorse agreed measures for the protection of the fundamental rights of everyone on this island. The Good Friday Agreement envisages all political parties on the island working together to establish a human rights culture throughout the island that we do not appear to have at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and I thank the Minister for introducing it in head form at committee level, which allowed for a fine debate. The establishment of the Human Rights Commission is a great opportunity to improve human rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The independent consultancy review I have initiated is of the operations and structure of the major State ports operating in the Shannon Estuary, namely, Foynes Port Company and Shannon Estuary Ports Company. The review will focus on whether changes in operational-management structures might significantly benefit port users and generate increased trade, industrial growth and employment for the benefit of the region as a whole. I am convinced that if there are strong commercial or developmental advantages to changing the present structures, these should be brought into the public domain and clearly identified.</P>
      <P>It is time to take a critical look at the real potential of the ports industry in the Shannon Estuary, which has to compete on a commercial basis with larger ports. There is tremendous scope for further industrial and commercial development of the Shannon Estuary and its hinterland which will generate jobs and economic growth in the area. We must ensure that the estuary is served by port structures which are dynamic and focused in order to drive development forward and to act as a magnet for new shipping business. I see significant scope to develop further the national assets of the Shannon Estuary to meet their full potential for transhipment, tourism and cruise liner business.</P>
      <P>In deciding to initiate this review, I have borne in mind recommendations contained in a number of expert reports commissioned by my Department which suggest that a merging of the two ports would provide a cost effective, competitive and dynamic platform for development. Other interested bodies such as the Institute of Master Mariners and IBEC have supported rationalisation. My Department has also examined the current structure of and relationship between the ports in the estuary in the context of its corporate governance function and identified potential for improvements. In light of these views and to ensure that every means of maximising port and ancillary activity in the estuary is appraised, it is essential that an objective, professional and inclusive review of current structures is carried out as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both port companies have identical, not separate, commercial mandates and statutory objectives for the management, control, operation and development of facilities and must conduct business at all times in a cost effective and efficient manner. The independent review will be fully inclusive and will involve a wide-ranging consultation process encompassing all interests, including port users, employee and employer representatives, State development agencies and shipping-transport interests. I particularly wish to determine whether the existing multi-port arrange<Col N="1039" /> ment is meeting user needs or if a stronger more focused and dynamic port organisation or grouping of ports could provide a better and more cost effective service. I am keen to establish whether stakeholders consider a unified port entity or a confederation of ports would give a better platform to develop new initiatives and enhance the socio-economic development of the estuary and region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This review came as a bolt from the blue. The ports were designated commercial semi-State ports only in 1997. There is a perception that the Minister wishes to amalgamate Foynes and the Shannon Estuary Ports Company and is using the review as a mechanism. All relevant information is already available. The Minister said IBEC is in favour of rationalisation. Does he see a bias on the part of the chairman of the Foynes Port Company who is an IBEC nominee? Is the Minister aware of the concern in Foynes about the uncertainty this review has created in a port which is progressing rapidly? The last thing the Minister should seek is confrontation after the issues which arose in recent times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of development and improvement is ongoing and my Department has a statutory responsibility to ensure it continues. The estuary has a great deal of potential. A review of the ports was carried out and the report was published recently. I met the port authorities and made it clear that I do not mind what way they set about achieving the best results for the Shannon Estuary. They can work together or find effective ways of co-operating or they can federate in one way or other or amalgamate. The question is whether there is potential for better development. It is one of the best harbours in the world but it is not getting the turnover that would be typical of such a harbour. I am anxious to ensure that, one way or other, its potential is realised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are plenty of reports. In 1979 the estuary was described as the jewel of the western world. Transhipment has been floated previously. Con Power chaired a committee, established by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, on the estuary. The Minister is creating a degree of uncertainty which is unnecessary. There are officials in the Department who, for a long time, wanted this amalgamation and they see the review as the means of achieving it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be individuals in various quarters who might see amalgamation as a desirable objective for the Shannon Estuary. However, the results of this study, when they are available, will be transparent and everybody can make their views known. Shannon Estuary is not, for example, getting its share of the cruise liners. <Col N="1040" /> Why is this happening and what can be done to ensure that it gets its share?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that if they worked together to promote the Shannon Estuary, they might do more towards achieving it. I do not know the answer. That is the reason for carrying out the review. Nobody need feel threatened. This is an age in which people should not feel threatened by matters such as this. It is an age of transparency when people can study these things and see if there is anything of benefit for them. If there is, well and good. However, nothing will happen over anybody's head so they need not be concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan provides £938 million in EU and Exchequer funding for marine and natural resources as follows: seafood industry, £171 million; forestry, £592 million; coastal protection, £35 million; sea ports, £46 million; inland fisheries, £24 million; marine tourism and leisure, £20 million; marine and forestry RTDI, £50 million. An outline of plans for the funding of the individual sectors is included in the plan but will be developed in more detail in the preparation of the individual programmes under the plan on economic and social infrastructure, employment and human resources, the productive sector and the two regional programmes.</P>
      <P>Investment in the seafood industry will support the development of seafood processing, the expansion of aquaculture, enhanced safety, quality and efficiency of the fishing fleet, development of infrastructure and onshore facilities in fishery harbours, training programmes and marketing strategies. Investment in forestry will support extensive new planting, development of roads and harvesting, and training. Investment in coastal protection will preserve economic and public infrastructure and areas of ecological importance; investment in regional ports will support infrastructure and improve capacity utilisation; and investment in inland fisheries and marine tourism and leisure will support the sustainable development of these resources for tourism and leisure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the marine and forestry sectors have important roles to play in the national development plan, given their importance to rural communities and their potential for contribution to <Col N="1041" /> economic and social development, particularly in the less developed rural and coastal areas. While not included in the NDP, investment in oil, gas and mineral exploration by the private sector will continue to be encouraged through fiscal incentives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since tabling the question I got a copy of the programme and many of the points in my question are largely answered in the document. Under the existing programme some of the funding allocated under a variety of headings may not be used because the programmes have not been developed. Will the Minister indicate if he is confident the allocations under the various headings in the national plan can be met and if that will be dealt with in a co-ordinated way on a sectoral basis in the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the money will be drawn down in this period and it is probable that it will be drawn down before the end of the period of the plan. The Deputy is correct in that difficulties arose previously in some areas where the capacity to develop an investment was not sufficiently advanced. In the case of the inland fisheries, great difficulties were experienced in the early years but the money was allocated to worthwhile projects in the later stage. All the money allocated will be used up before the end of 1999. From now on there will no difficulty in making use of the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the programme £35 million is allocated for coastal protection. While that appears to be a great deal of money, coastal protection works are costly. Will the Minister indicate the quantity of work that can be achieved by spending that amount on coastal protection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities also contribute towards many coastal protection works and such contributions would be additional to the £35 million allocated under the programme. Up until last year less than £1 million per annum was allocated to coastal protection and most of that allocation came from the EU. The budget provided for an allocation of approximately £4 million per annum for coastal protection and that together with the allocation from the EU brings the yearly allocation up to £5 million. That means much more work can be carried out. A total of £5 million for each year of the programme can be spent on coastal protection, which is an excellent plane of expenditure from which to be working. More work in this area may be undertaken. Some coastal protection works may cost £150,000, £200,000 or £250,000 and others may cost £1.5 million. The increased allocation means we will be able to undertake much more work than we were able to tackle in the past.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I must point out that the project referred to by the Deputy commenced more than 20 years ago, in the late 1970s. My reply is based on the records of these events and in the time available it has not been possible to fully research all aspects of the issues raised.</P>
      <P>The Irish company mentioned by the Deputy was established in the late 1970s. The company planned an integrated catching and processing operation based on Dinish Island in Castletownbere. Five fishing vessels were licensed between 1979 and 1983, prior to the introduction of the licensing provisions in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1983. The vessels were intended to land into the processing factory and to be crewed, after an interim period, by Irish fishermen. The project fell short of that envisaged. The landings by the vessels into the State were exported fresh to the Spanish market and few Irish fishermen were employed as crewmen. The factory operated below capacity using fish from sources other than the company's own vessels.</P>
      <P>I understand that in 1978 IDA grants of £535,000 capital and £49,000 training were approved for a processing plant in Dinish Island, Castletownbere, County Cork towards an investment of £1.16 million involving three phases of development and 115 target jobs. In addition, BIM paid a grant of £125,000 under the marine credit plan towards the purchase of one of the company's fishing vessels. The IDA paid out grants of £421,000. The balance of the grants approved were not paid as the projected activity for the premises did not meet the targets agreed and the jobs delivered fell short of the target. The maximum number of full-time jobs delivered appears to have been 28. The IDA, however, took the decision not to seek any claw-back of the grants paid in order to maintain employment in the factory. Under the 1991-93 Community Support Framework a total of £45,000 in EU and national grants was paid towards the upgrading of the processing premises. Some 35 to 40 full and part-time workers are employed currently in the processing factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pilot project, as envisaged, was never repeated reflecting the difficulties experienced and the major changes in fishing policy and the industry in subsequent years. It is my understanding that the matter of revoking the licenses in question was examined repeatedly in the mid-<Col N="1043" /> 1980s but that it did not prove possible to pursue that course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the funding allocated to this project, will the Minister agree that what appears to be happening is a disgrace? The sum of £430,000 was a great deal of money in the 1970s, but the delivery on that investment is disappointing. In the context of our fisheries, does he think it is most unjust that, in many cases, five vessels, flying the Irish flag and fishing in Irish waters are delivering their fish to Vigo in Spain and competing against Irish fishermen in the process? I understand fishermen are employed in the Eiranova Fishery on a part-time basis and the work involves mainly acquacultural products. It is shocking that a project, which was announced with a fanfare of trumpets by the then Minister, Paddy Power, in the late 1970s, with a bridge connecting the areas and all the other expenses involved in the establishment of the project, has not been sustained. We do not seem to be able to do anything about that, yet five vessels fishing in those waters, four with lovely Irish names pertinent to the area, are landing their catches in Spain. That is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>Our objective is to maximise the economic links. It is also an objective of other countries to try to tie in economic links with local flag State, especially between Irish registered vessels and our coastal communities. This is, however, an extremely complex legal question involving such fundamental treaty issues as the right of establishment and freedom of movement. We are currently examining the Commission's clarification on the application of economic link principles. I will examine all possible means of ensuring economic links. In doing so, I must be fully satisfied that these are within the links of Community law and not vulnerable to challenge in the European Court.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources if his attention has been drawn to the fact that further development of the fishing fleet will be impeded if the financial instrument for fishery guidance proposal is introduced recommending that a 30 per cent excess tonnage will have to be taken out of the fleet capacity to justify purchasing a new or second-hand vessel and making development of the fishing fleet prohibitive; and if he will ensure this does not happen.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The negotiations on EU Structural Funding for fisheries, post-1999 were concluded at the Council of Fisheries Ministers meeting on 21 and 22 November. My utmost priority was to ensure that a satisfactory financial regulation was agreed by Council which would allow for continu<Col N="1044" /> ing investment in the industry under the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>I had fundamental problems, in principle and in practice, with the Commission's proposed terms and conditions for grant-aiding fleet renewal. The major difficulty for Ireland related, as the Deputy points out, to the provision which required that a 130 per cent tonnage replacement policy should be applied to all new and second-hand vessels entering the fleet with grant-aid support. With the backing of other member states, I held out against the hardline proposals at the June and October Councils and forced the Presidency and the Commission to reconsider the terms of the detailed rules governing public investment in the fleet.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that at the Council meeting on 21 and 22 November I successfully faced down the Commission's proposals to introduce the requirement for a 130 per cent replacement capacity. The agreement I secured at Council provides that where annual EU fleet targets are met a principle of one for one replacement and not 130 per cent should continue to apply as a pre-condition for grant-aiding new and modern second-hand fishing vessels. I made it clear to the Council that I could not accept any attempt to either overrule fleet capacity requirements which had already been provided for separately in a 1997 Council decision or to pre-empt political negotiations and decisions on the next fleet programme which will be determined in 2001. This would have seriously impeded our plans to modernise the inshore fisheries sector, where half of our fishermen are employed, and the whitefish sector, at a time when modernisation is critical to make it safer and more competitive with other EU fleets.</P>
      <P> I also won Council agreement for my proposal that within the grant aid provisions there should be specific support for young fishermen to become boat owners in the industry. That agreement provides that fishermen under 35 will be eligible for a grant of up to 50,000 euros. In addition, I ensured that small scale coastal fishing vessels of up to 12 metres, groups of vessel owners or a family of fishermen can avail of a 150,000 euro premium for development.</P>
      <P>The agreement secured at the Council of Ministers represents a realistic balance between the conservation of fish stocks and the need to ensure a safe, modern and high quality work environment for fishermen.</P>

      <P>An integral part of the Common Fisheries Policy is related to these structural matters for the fisheries sector to help revitalise areas dependent on fisheries. While I am pleased the Minister faced down the other communities which support the measure, I am sure they put the same interpretation on the papers as the Minister. I am delighted it resulted in a ratio of 1:1, as concern was expressed about the proposal. It was always believed the matter should be discussed under the next multi-annual guidance programme. Is this matter likely to be on the agenda <Col N="1045" /> in 2001 or can we, in the context of the national development plan and fleet modernisation, assure fishermen that it will not be revisited then? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be able to give that assurance. That is the time when the size of the fleets will be reconsidered and when the multi-annual guidance programme will be revisited. People will make different suggestions on how the fleets can be contained. We will not have the same problem at that stage because our difficulty is that our fleet urgently needs to be modernised and upgraded because it is old. If the proposal had been accepted, it would have penalised anyone upgrading their fleet. We must watch that carefully when the time comes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said others had the same view. They may sometimes have similar views but they are not always the same because everyone has different interests. We had to be careful to ensure the areas which needed support were looked after. My officials played a major part in the difficult and long drawn out negotiations. Our proposed wording was eventually accepted, although some other countries did not get what they wanted.</P>

Given the uncertainty about returning to this issue again in 2001, surely we should modernise and upgrade our fleet in 2000? As regards the financial package available under the national development plan in the next few years, surely we should try to get as much of this work as possible done next year and continue to modernise our fleet? </P>

      <P>The land under forestry at the end of 1998 totalled 620,000 hectares or 9 per cent of the land area of the country. The strategic plan for the forestry sector, &ldquo;Growing for the Future&rdquo;, proposes an increase to 17 per cent by 2030. The plan sets out planting targets of 20,000 hectares annually from 2001 onwards. Some £500 million has been earmarked for the afforestation programme under the national development plan, the focus of which will be new planting by or on behalf of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have identified the need to increase the level of grants and premia for afforestation and discussions with the European Commission are at an advanced stage. I confirm that the increased <Col N="1046" /> rates, when agreed, will benefit all planting which takes place during the current season. I am also in the process of ensuring there will be greater compatibility between forestry and REPS under the new rural development programme.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree there is considerable scope for expansion in the forestry industry given the low level of afforestation with only 8 per cent to 9 per cent of land used for that purpose compared to the EU average of 30 per cent? Some 7 per cent of our land was planted in 1993 but we have only increased our percentage by 2 per cent since then. I am sure the Minister of State agrees that is a shocking state of affairs. The development of forestry on a certain scale and in a particular manner can contribute to national economic and social well being on a substantial basis compatible with the protection of the environment.</P>

Why can we not develop something along those lines? When will the new afforestation premia be introduced? There is no interest in forestry in this country. I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on the plans he has for afforestation for the period 2000 to 2006.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy who seems to be well informed. Not everyone is aware of CO2 emissions, but I am delighted the people of the south west are conscious of them. If this country is to reach its targets under the Kyoto Agreement, it must increase its planting levels. I assure the Deputy that is and has been my intention since I came to office. We have removed some of the obstacles in the way of doing this and we will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the low rate of premia paid for planting. I hope to be in a position before Christmas to announce a substantial increase in the premia. I hope that will change the view farmers have of forestry and encourage them to consider it as a good alternative to conventional farming. I have put a new computer system in place which will speed up the payment of grants. I have also appointed nine new foresters which will help to increase our levels to the 17 per cent <Col N="1047" /> target. The farmer definition from 2000 onwards will also be different. I have also appointed six new office staff.</P>

We are in violation of the agreement signed in Kyoto. I cannot understand why only 50 per cent of the afforestation set out in the Government's 1996 strategic plan has been achieved. Will the Minister assure that forestry grants will be increased to a level which will make it attractive for Irish farmers to participate in the industry?</P>

I am holding out for the best possible deal and I should finalise such a deal by Christmas. I agree with Deputy Sheehan about CO2 emissions. I am reliably informed that conifers extract more CO2 from the atmosphere than any other plant and it is essential afforestation increases.</P>

      <P>A total of 18 fishing vessels registered in other countries were detained by the Irish authorities in the period 1 October 1998 to 31 October 1999. The detentions arose from suspected fisheries offences which included log-book infringements, illegal fishing, retention on board of undersized fish and failure to make mandatory reports. Fines and forfeitures ranging from £75 to £137,365 were imposed by the courts in 16 cases. One vessel was released without charge and a formal written warning was issued in another case.</P>
      <P>Revocation of a fishing vessel's licence would, primarily, be a matter for the authorities in the country of registry, and I have no information that any licence has been revoked. I have, however, in keeping with the commitment to close co-operation, liaison and information exchange on fisheries monitoring and control with other countries, directed my Department to ensure that any convictions before the Irish courts are brought to the attention of the relevant authorities in a vessel's country of registry.</P>

The weighbridge in the sea is important &ndash; ships have to report when they enter one of the ICES segments and have to report what quantities they have when they leave. That creates a new situation because they can be checked more readily.</P>
      <P>Satellite monitoring will be introduced on 1 January. While it will take some time for the system to become fully effective, it is expected that will be helpful in tracking vessels.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 38 of 20 October 1999, in which I outlined my plans to implement the recommendations of the interdepartmental working group which I set up to carry out a review of the safety regulations in adventure-activity centres, the report of which I published in June of this year. The interdepartmental working group considered that there is a case for a form of statutory regulation of safety in adventure centre activities in Ireland and recommended the establishment of a new statutory authority to manage the regulatory scheme.</P>
      <P>The aim of the new authority should be to encourage high safety standards, particularly in that part of the sector which has not participated in the existing voluntary approval schemes run by the centre standards board of the Association for Adventure Sports &ndash; AFAS &ndash; and the Irish Sailing Association.</P>
      <P> I welcomed the group's recommendations and in July I secured Government approval to establish the new statutory authority. Work is progressing within my Department with a view to introducing the necessary legislation to establish the new statutory authority as early as possible next year. I am conscious, however, that setting up the new authority and putting in place statutory codes will take some time. It is very important that existing voluntary schemes not only continue in operation but are enhanced and extended in the interim. With this in mind I recently provided a grant of £30,000 to the centre standards board of AFAS to maintain and expand its work to provide an effective approval scheme pending the establishment of the new authority.</P>
      <P>My Department is working with AFAS to prepare the ground for the new statutory authority. As part of this process, AFAS will carry out a consultation process, including hosting a major seminar for national governing bodies and providers early next year, with the aim of achieving consensus on the best way forward in Ireland. I would encourage all national governing bodies, centres and organisations involved in adventure activities to associate themselves with the interim measures with a view to extending their coverage in advance of the statutory scheme.</P>

      <P>The review which I published recently of the State's 16 commercial regional ports and harbours which have a cargo throughput of less than 250,000 tonnes develops a general strategic framework for the ports and harbours concerned aimed at maximising their financial sustainability, their contribution to strategic maritime policy objectives and socio-economic impacts.</P>
      <P>The need to address the future of the State regional ports and harbours has been acknowledged in a range of official publications from Partnership 2000 to the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium. The action plan underlines the priority to transfer small harbours to local control to develop marine leisure activities. This is also a key priority in the implementation of the Department's strategy statement 1998-2000. The revised An Action Programme for the Millennium, published earlier this month, commits to the support of priority infrastructural development in commercial ports and assists restructuring of non-commercial regional ports. This review charts the way forward for the regional ports and sets out a long-term, coherent and sustainable development strategy for their future and the people who rely on them directly and indirectly for their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the review, I initiated a full consultative process. While I am aware that consultants met and considered the views of relevant interests including those of the port authorities and management, and other interested State tourism and local commercial development bodies it is essential that all stakeholders and interests, including harbour authorities, are given an opportunity to comment on the recommendations which emerged from the review in advance of any decisions being made.</P>

      <P>This was one of the recommendations of the group. I had many of these reports published over the past year and a half. A backlog had built up. It had been the policy not to publish these reports; they were purely internal departmental reports. When I was Minister in this Department before 1992 I decided that these reports should be published. This had implications because reports which are intended for publication must be written in a different way and people must be notified that what they say will be included in a published report. It took some time to deal with these details and quite a few reports have been published since then. The group felt it was important not to delay investigations. There will be some leeway but dates and times will be fixed for publication.</P>

      <P>This report will be published as soon as printed copies become available. The printing process is well advanced and copies should be in the hands of Deputies within the next two weeks. The delay in finalising the report has been due to a combination of factors. Principal among these was my request that the task force responsible for producing the report carry out investigations of claims of dumping in the 1950s and 1960s which came to light subsequent to the setting up of the task force and also the availability of further information from the UK authorities.</P>

Day-to-day management of the centres will be removed from my Department, in line with the principles of subsidiarity, to promote greater local involvement and initiative and to facilitate a more commercial approach to delivering services at local level.</P>
      <P>The new management system will be the most significant development in the administration of the fishery harbour centres since the enactment of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968. It will be firmly based on local involvement through boards which will have an input on all issues affecting maintenance and development of their harbours. Mechanisms for appropriate levels of co-ordination between the harbours will also be put in place to ensure a consistent overall national response to fishery harbour development requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>A report on the investigation into the collision between the French fishing vessel <i>Agena</i> and the Irish fishing vessel <i>Orchidee</i>, undertaken by the marine survey office of my Department, was published on 19 September 1999. The Deputies will be aware from my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 25 and 60 of 20 October 1999 that publication of this report is an extremely sensitive matter, and understandably so, for the families of the deceased members of the crew of the <i>Orchidee</i>, Mr. James Power and Mr. Robert Doran.</P>
      <P>The families have expressed concerns about the report, and these concerns were explored in detail at a lengthy meeting with the Power and Doran families held in my Department on 29 September last. The principal concern of the families is that the report and the media commentary on it are, in their view, open to the interpretation that both vessels were at equal fault in the tragic accident which occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate, however, that it is not the purpose of the report to attribute fault or blame, as such, to any party but rather to identify what happened and if the accident could have been avoided. It is <Col N="1055" /> very important, if further accidents of this type are to be avoided, that the lessons of the tragic loss of the <i>Orchidee</i> are brought home to the owners and crews of all vessels.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, it was not the purpose of the report to apportion blame as between the parties. However, without in any way seeking to qualify the findings in the report, I can only repeat what I stated in my previous replies, which is that it would be entirely wrong to draw any inference that both parties were equally at fault. On the contrary, it is my strong opinion, having considered all the circumstances of the case, that the Irish vessel, which was almost stationary in the water and which was struck at speed at night by another larger vessel on which proper watch was not being maintained, was a passive party to the accident and, in that sense, was in no way responsible for causing it. These views have been conveyed to the families and I sincerely hope that it will be of some solace to them in coping with the tragic losses they have had to endure.</P>
    <P>I hope these views and the public statements on the tragic incident and on the terms of the report made by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and myself, will allow all to draw this matter to a close. It is my strong view, in the circumstances and for the good of all concerned, that this matter should not be further considered in the absence of new relevant and substantial developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss of the <i>Orchidee</i> has caused grief to both families. There was a delay of seven years in the issuing of the findings. Certain factors may have been outside the Minister's control in that it went through the French courts. However, the fact that the two fishermen were sentenced in the French court is testimony that the Irish fishermen were not culpable.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he will communicate with the people as far he can and, while he is not willing to apportion blame, he is putting the emphasis on the French side. Has he communicated that to the media? Concern was expressed to me that an article in a reputable marine journal apportioned blame to both the Irish and French crews. That has caused a great deal of angst to the bereaved families. I am not sure the families are convinced that that apportionment has been fully communicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy said. This is a difficult and sensitive situation. The delay was occasioned by the court case in France and the lengthy procedures before and during it. The court case made the position clear in regard to blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as was said earlier in regard to reporting on accidents, when independent surveyors are asked to give a report they give it in accordance with the existing laws and facts. They do not apportion blame. The problem is that there are two separate issues, the state or con<Col N="1056" /> dition of any of the vessels in regard to international regulations and so on and the question of who is to blame. It has been clearly established who was to blame in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Our principal roles are to investigate and report on accidents and to provide immediate assistance through the Irish Marine Emergency Service. The objective is to learn the lessons to be drawn and make them known to fishermen in particular to ensure there is not a repeat. Much time, money and effort is put into this and it is paying off. Fishermen need to be aware of the causes of accidents. This is a matter on which the Department follows through.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources the views he is taking to the Fisheries Council meeting in December 1999; if he is being guided by objective expertise regarding the merits of banning twin riggers from the heavily overfished Irish Sea; and if the interests of the large trawlers are being catered for to the detriment of the single riggers whose range is mainly restricted to Irish Sea fishing grounds or at least what remains of them.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in relation to the levels of exploitation of certain key white fish stocks in the Irish Sea. Cod and whiting stocks were heavily exploited in the early 1990s and scientific advice suggests that there is a need to rebuild them. There are a variety of reasons for the general decline of cod and whiting stocks in the last decade. These include high levels of by-catches of young fish in mixed species and prawn fisheries, high levels of discards, fishing in inshore nursery areas and semi-pelagic trawling for cod by some fleets. While the bulk of the Irish east coast fleet and part of the Northern Ireland fleet now practice twin rigging, there is no evidence that this is the primary or sole factor associated with the decline of cod and whiting stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BIM and the Marine Institute have at my request been holding a series of consultative workshops with fishermen around the coast to discuss the new package of conservation <Col N="1057" /> measures which will be introduced from 1 January 2000 and to identify additional conservation measures which could be progressed with the support of the industry. Workshops were held in August and September with fishermen in Clogherhead and Howth. I understand no proposals for a general ban on twin rigging were raised. BIM is finalising a report on the workshops shortly and will outline the range of conservation measures which could be taken at national and European level with the support of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I have received the most recent scientific advice which confirms serious concerns about the state of cod and whiting stocks in the Irish Sea. The European Commission's proposals on total allowable catch levels for the year 2000 are expected within the next two weeks and will take account of this scientific advice. As most of the total allowable catch is shared between the United Kingdom and Ireland I have asked my officials to liaise with the UK authorities in advance of the December Fisheries Council with a view to finding a way forward that will help to protect and rebuild stocks while taking account of the need to protect the livelihoods of fishermen dependent on the fishery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a policy on discards and undersize fish? I understand the Norwegian Government has such a policy which is considered progressive. Given the high levels of discards, which is a source of serious concern, it is easy to understand the reasons stocks are declining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To resolve what is a major problem I have suggested to the European Commission and the Fisheries Council that observers should be allowed on larger vessels as an additional measure. The Commissioner has indicated that he is willing to look at this. Other measures which have proved effective include the square mesh panel on nets. This was first suggested to me on a visit to Howth with representatives of BIM and others in 1992 by a young fisherman while tending his nets on the pier. I asked the representatives of BIM to follow it up as it seemed a good idea. It entails the use of a square panel, instead of a diamond, to allow smaller fish to escape. The relevant regulation was agreed by the Fisheries Council last year and took effect throughout the European Union from 1 July last.</P>

      <P>In August I established an action group on small powered recreational craft, including personal water craft and jet skis. The group has recently presented me with its interim report and its final report is due by the end of February next. I have laid a copy of the report in the Oireachtas Library for reference. The action group solicited public submissions by way of an advertisement in the national press in September. I understand many submissions have been made. A series of three seminars have been held by the Marine Institute on the topics of jet skis, commercial and small pleasure craft in October and November. These were well attended and will be invaluable in informing the work of the action group and the Department's considerations of future options. I understand the Sea Scouting Association was represented by two members at the last seminar in Athlone on 17 November and that they actively participated in the discussions.</P>
      <P>The work of the action group is intended to provide me with a final report which will include proposals for any necessary regulations and other measures needed to establish a best practice regime in Ireland. This will be only the first step and I recognise that this process can only be developed through full consultation with all relevant users. I am committed to a full partnership approach in this process and welcome any input or suggestion from any interested party. Any submission received by me from the scout associations involved in sea scouting will be brought to the attention of the action group.</P>

The interim report was published within six weeks. This has been an effective process and the final report will be produced at the end of February.

      <P>There are two underdeveloped petroleum accumulations offshore Ireland, the Helvick oil field off the coast of Waterford and the Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo which offer possibilities for further petroleum production in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Helvick oil field is held under a petroleum lease and the lessee is required to submit a detailed plan of development for the field by the end of April next year for my approval. This is a small oil accumulation, but it would be welcome as a first commercial oil development. Any oil produced from the field would have small quantities of associated gas, but these would not be significant in relation to current gas requirements and may not be put into the national transmission grid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Corrib gas field, the licensees have stated that further work needs to be done to enable a conclusion on commercial viability to be reached. They are currently considering drilling another appraisal well next year after which I would expect that they would be in a position to make a decision on whether the gas can be produced commercially. A decision has not been taken at this time on the location for landing the <Col N="1060" /> gas in Ireland, or on how the gas would be brought to market. I note BGE's recent announcement of extending the national grid from Dublin to Galway and Ennis and it is likely that this could have an influence on decisions by the Corrib licensees. The responsibility for the national gas grid is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that in the 2025 report published recently by Bord Gais, in regard to ways in which expected demand will be met after 2004, the Corrib gas accumulation was identified as one of the three preferred supply options to be considered further. The other two options identified were the duplication of the existing Scotland-Ireland interconnector and the construction of a gas pipeline from Scotland through Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether an application has been received for a petroleum licence from Enterprise Oil in the context of the Corrib gas find? As we are all aware, the Marathon gas will come to an end in the year 2004 and 50% of our natural gas is imported, and unless we have an alternative gas supply by 2004, we will have to import 100% of our gas requirement. Is the Minister in discussion with Bord Gais and Enterprise Oil on this matter? If gas comes ashore and Bord Gais have the resources with regard to the pipelines, would it make economic sense to use those pipelines?</P>

      <P>The question of the pipelines is a matter for Bord Gais to decide. I presume Enterprise Oil and its partners would be happy to use those but they would have to do that through negotiation with Bord Gais. That would be a commercial deal on their part and how far they and Bord Gais will go is a matter for negotiation. I hope the third well will be successful.</P>
      <P>In relation to Enterprise Oil, I would have to investigate what it might have in terms of further licences. It has the licences on those four sections&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the question of the supply, the supply will go a little beyond 2004 because of the southern lobe on the Kinsale gas field. It may last another two years and the technology employed by Marathon has helped in that regard. In relation to Enterprise Oil's proposals to produce here, a framework group is working on the implications of that development for industry and employment here. We are working with SIPTU to try to ensure that there is the maximum possible involvement of Irish workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of breaching the causeway to the Bull Island has been considered by Dublin Corporation on a number of occasions over the years and I am aware of the most recent resolution.</P>
      <P>As outlined in previous replies to the Deputy, in the event that Dublin Corporation, or any other party, wish to undertake any work on or impacting on the foreshore it will be necessary, under the Foreshore Acts, 1933-98, for it to obtain a foreshore lease, licence or permission as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Application for a foreshore lease, licence or permission must be accompanied by copies of all drawings and plans relating to the proposed works. It is likely from the wording of the resolution that an environmental impact statement, an EIS, would also be required. Plans and other documentation submitted are examined at administrative and technical level within my Department to assess the impact of the proposed works on coastal erosion, accretion, navigation, safety at sea, fishing and fish stocks, etc. Further detail may be requested, if required. Assuming there is no objection to the proposed works the issue is put to public consultation.</P>
      <P>The public consultation period is 21 days where an EIS is not required and one month where an EIS is required. In the event of any objections being made during the consultation period, the applicant would be given an opportunity to respond to the objections. It would then be a matter for me, in the light of all the available information, to decide whether to offer terms of a foreshore lease, licence or permission. Should such an offer be made and the terms accepted, a formal legal document will then issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foregoing outlines the procedure which Dublin Corporation will have to undergo before <Col N="1062" /> it can commence any work on the foreshore at the Bull Island causeway.</P>
    <P>The Bull Island is designated by Dúchas as an area of special protection. It will be necessary, therefore, for the corporation to consult with and obtain the approval of that body before undertaking any work. The corporation will have to comply with any requirements for the protection of flora and fauna which Dúchas may impose arising from its obligations under the birds and habitats directives of the European Union, and also comply with any requirements which Dúchas may impose for the protection of the archaeological heritage of the areas in question.</P>

I would be happy to arrange meetings to further that process. We will have to look at the issue of moneys. This is a major problem and a major issue.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In a few days we mark the 51st anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights, adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948. The basic principle of that document is set out in the first sentence of Article 1 which states: &ldquo;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.&rdquo;  That principle is the cornerstone of the Labour Party's philosophy and that of social democracy and socialism everywhere in the world. Tragically, the lessons of two world wars which preceded the universal declaration have not been learned and the denial of rights is widespread in many parts of our globe. War, hunger, poverty and oppression continue to threaten the lives of millions of our fellow human beings. <Col N="1064" /> Scenes that we had hoped were consigned to the horrors of the past &ndash; concentration camps and rape as a weapon of war &ndash; have reoccurred in the closing years of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>As the economies in this part of the world grow richer, it becomes easier to look inwards, to ensconce ourselves behind fortress Europe, to concentrate on promoting our own economic growth and forget the plight of so many of our fellow citizens of the world. That is why the Labour Party believes that our commitment to the rights recognised by the universal declaration must be recognised in deeds and not just in words. Human rights on the international plane and in the domestic sphere have always been at the top of the Labour Party's agenda. We view the protection of rights not as a convenient slogan but, in the words of the Vienna declaration on human rights, as the first obligation of Government.</P>
      <P>When we were in Government, Deputy Spring spearheaded the drafting and ratification of a number of key international human rights instruments, most notably the protocol setting up the new full-time European Court of Human Rights, which came into force earlier this month. It is remarkable that since this Government took office, it has not ratified any human rights treaties, nor has it initiated any major human rights legislation, apart from reviving the Labour Party's Employment Equality Bill and Equal Status Bill, and the War Crimes Bill and Geneva Convention Bill which were also initiated by Labour in Government.</P>
      <P>The Government's only firm proposals regarding human rights legislation arise, as the Minister has stated, from the Good Friday Agreement, specifically under the heading &ldquo;Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity&rdquo;. It is worth reciting that section in full:</P>
      <P>The Irish Government will also take steps to further strengthen the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction. The Government will, taking account of the work of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and the Report of the Constitution Review Group, bring forward measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights. These proposals will draw on the European Convention on Human Rights and other international legal instruments in the field of human rights and the question of the incorporation of the ECHR will be further examined in this context. The measures brought forward would ensure at least an equivalent protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Irish Government will: establish a Human Rights Commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within Northern Ireland and.introduce equal status legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> The British Government was able to move rapidly on its solemn commitment to establish a Human Rights Commission. The legislation was put through Westminster at the end of last year and it appointed a head of that commission in March. The British Government also acted to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law throughout the United Kingdom, leaving Ireland as the only member of the European Union to have failed to do so.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, there was no action on this side of the Irish Sea until recently. My party was able to publish its proposals for a human rights Bill on 1 December 1998. We did so in a constructive spirit, as part of our contribution to the 50th anniversary of the universal declaration on human rights and in order to play a small part in the attempt to ensure that the next 50 years will see the high aspirations of the declaration come to pass for all people, given that everybody is born free and equal in dignity and rights. It took the Government more than 15 months to produce a Bill, which was published last July. It is now unlikely that the human rights commission will be up and running until well into next year. I welcome the timely arrival in the House of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. This lackadaisical approach is also evidenced by the Government's policy on Irish aid, its approach to the International Monetary Fund and the policy of the World Bank on structural adjustment programmes. Most of all it is evidenced by the chaotic shambles &ndash; to borrow a phrase &ndash; on immigration policy. It suggests that human rights do not rank very highly on the priority list of the Government.</P>
    <P>I strongly agree with the views expressed by Deputy Flanagan that the disastrous decision to amalgamate the Department of Justice with the Department of Equality and Law Reform is partly to blame for the deprioritisation of what is known in the confines of the Department as &ldquo;soft legislation&rdquo;. It is critically important that meeting our rights and obligations under the Good Friday Agreement has priority and it is unacceptable that we lag one year behind the UK in meeting our requirements which in legislative terms are much lighter than those required from the British authorities.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bill it is important to re-examine our commitment to the restructuring of Third World debt. The attitude of forcing through legislation uniformly opposed by those at the front edge of Third World debt amelioration and the delivery of Third World aid indicates where the Government's heart lies. Taken with the delay in processing the equal status legislation, it provides more evidence of the fundamental mistake of the Government in abandoning the Department of Equality and Law Reform. It is important that we examine the issue of Government and parliamentary reform so that the Parliament can have its say. Not only are we lagging <Col N="1066" /> behind in legislative terms as a consequence of abandoning that Department, but those in the community whose equality was under threat or whose basic rights needed vindication benefited immeasurably from having such an able advocate as Mervyn Taylor at the Cabinet table. There is nobody in the Cabinet to do that now as the job of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is too broad to have that narrow and clear focus. I wonder whether the requirement under the previous administration that all legislation which came to Cabinet be checked for its impact on equality, particularly on women, is still enforced. I know how rigorously it was enforced by the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform. Observations of the Department of Finance and, importantly, the Department of Equality and Law Reform, invariably appeared on every memorandum brought before Government. It would be a very telling tale to know whether that requirement still holds good and whether the current Minister who has a much broader remit than equality and law reform is as diligent in the vindication of equality issues as his predecessor when these matters are discussed at Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important and I welcome it. It is important that the Government demonstrates a complete commitment to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. Legislation is still outstanding for which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, not surprisingly, is responsible. His Department stated that from the date of the publication of the Good Friday Agreement amendments are required to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts. We have inquired several times about the precise nature of these requirements and when amendments will be available, but amending legislation has yet to be published. Everybody in the House wishes the peace process well and we are I hope, within days of an agreement and the institutions which will flow from it going live, but a Bill has not been published and we do not have any notion regarding what it will contain.</P>
    <P>Last July I welcomed the publication of this Bill while strongly criticising the undue delay in bringing it forward. We support the intention to give effect to the Agreement and its commitments. We do so in order to contribute as constructively as we can. It is an immensely important Bill and it is important, therefore, that we devote sufficient time to it to ensure we get it right. The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights received the heads of the Bill, and I acknowledge this as an excellent mechanism for dealing with legislation. It allowed us receive submissions from a wide variety of groups which put forward their views before legislation was enacted. This model should be replicated for all important legislation. It gives the rightful status to the legislative committees and is a very good mechanism for ensuring legislation is improved upon. A number of organisations interested in human rights issues made <Col N="1067" /> submissions, many of which have been taken on board by the Government, while, unfortunately, some others have been ignored.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly compare the provisions of the Bill published last year by the Labour Party with the Bill now before the House. In essence the Labour Party sought to do three things, namely, the make the European Convention on Human Rights part of our law, like almost all of the other 39 countries on the Council of Europe. It is interesting that for the sixth time since the war we hold the presidency of the Council of Europe. It is important that we try to find a mechanism to incorporate into domestic law the important provisions of the convention, as the other countries, many of which have constitutions, have done. It would mean that Irish citizens would not need to go to Strasbourg to have their rights under the convention upheld. It is not good enough for the Minister to tell the House that for administrative reasons or the judgment made in 1996 that the European convention has legal sway in international but not domestic law, and that it is possible for an Irish citizen to seek redress in the European Court of Justice but not in domestic courts. It is important that citizens be able to rely on the convention in the courts to vindicate their rights.</P>
    <P>We also proposed to implement a number of other key UN and Council of Europe conventions in the legislation we drafted and tabled last year. Another of the key provisions of the Labour Bill was to oblige the Government to ratify the United Nations race discrimination and torture conventions as well as a number of other instruments. At a time when Ireland seeks membership of the United Nations Security Council, it is necessary, if we are to have any credibility in this area, that we ratify all key human rights conventions. I say that in the hope that, in the response of the Minister or of the Minister of State representing him, there will be an acknowledgement that this needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The third objective of the Labour Party Bill was to establish an independent human rights commission with powers to take cases of breaches of rights to court. While such a human rights commission was promised in the Good Friday Agreement, it has been part of our policy since before the previous general election and was incorporated in our manifesto which we put to the people at the time.</P>
    <P>The Government's Bill proposes to move on only one of the three main proposals. There will not be a statutory requirement on the Government to move on the outstanding backlog of international agreements which the State has been unable to ratify, nor will the commission have the function under this Bill, which is specifically conferred on it by the Labour Party Bill of &ldquo;encouraging ratification of human rights instruments or accession to those instruments, and their implementation&rdquo;. That is a salient and telling point. We have been tardy in doing that until now <Col N="1068" /> and it reveals a mindset in those who are charged with this area of policy.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any movement on the question of the incorporation of the European convention into domestic law, although the Minister hinted that the Government is examining some way of doing that. There was an element of concession in the Minister's suggestion. He said:</P>
    <P>. . . it is difficult to justify a situation where we alone, out of 41 contracting states of the Council of Europe, have not incorporated the convention into our law in some shape or form.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says it is difficult to justify, it is time he made a pledge to remedy it, to act upon it and to ensure the proposal in our Bill, the incorporation of the European convention into domestic law, is implemented without further delay.</P>
    <P>Of the rest of the detailed provisions of the Bill, the most important is that the Commission must be and must be seen to be independent. It is, therefore, important that the appointment of members should not be left at the whim of whatever Government is in power. Unfortunately, that is what is provided for in the Bill as drafted. When the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's RightsColour RGB 171,0,0 took submissions from a variety of groups, this was a point stressed by many. I do not mean to be facetious, but when we see visiting committees of prisons containing people with addresses which are readily identified with political parties and with the Minister sponsoring the Department, we need to be clear as regards this body that the political credentials of people who will form the Human Rights Commission will not be vetted in a way which some of the decisions of Ministers of all hues have tended to have been in the past.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the president of the commission will be extremely important. There was a tendency in the presentation we received from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and in the Bill as drafted that, while it is no longer a requirement, the president should be a judge or former judge. That is unnecessary. There are many eminent people who are not judges who would be much more suited to hold the presidency of this reforming new body. I hope the Minister of State brings that to the attention of her Government colleagues before any decision is made. I am concerned about the appointment of certain judges to that post. Being a judge or former judge does not confer on an individual such impartiality and knowledge of the field of human rights that they would make an obvious choice to hold the presidency of this innovative and important commission.</P>
    <P>In terms of the membership, I welcome the broadening of the numbers, but I would have preferred that there were a different mechanism for appointment. One of the recommendations of the report of the Joint Committee regarding membership of the human rights commission &ndash; item 13 on page two &ndash; states that the commission should <Col N="1069" /> be nominated by the Government but appointed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. It suggests that it should be on the same basis as the Ombudsman to show clear impartiality. That is something we should revisit on Committee Stage. I hope the Minister is open to considering that proposal.</P>
    <P>The issue of human rights and its location is something to which I will refer briefly. The legislation comes from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, although the Minister specifically charged with human rights matters is a Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Labour Party Bill suggested that, because of the importance of the legislation, it should be sited in the Department of the Taoiseach. That would have been a better approach. While I acknowledge the credentials of the Minister of State with responsibility for human rights, it would probably be wrong to consider human rights as an external or foreign issue solely concerned with the rights of minorities abroad rather than looking at ourselves and the inequalities and lack of citizenship and rights which obviously exist within our society.</P>
    <P>We have many acute problems. We do not have to go beyond the issue of travellers. The Administration of which I was a member enacted the traveller accommodation Act, yet there is still an appalling situation throughout the country regarding waiting lists for proper accommodation for travellers. The import of the legislation was to require local authorities to provide for travellers and to require county managers to do it if there were a blanket refusal by elected members to take their responsibilities seriously. However, there are many other areas. In the areas of health statistics of the travelling community, access to education and economic status, a large number of people do not enjoy equal citizenship and it is something we must rectify.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is a growing problem of racism in our society, racism which is often fuelled by ill thought out comments made by people who should, and in many cases do, know better. I agreed with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs when she characterised the recent utterances of some Fianna Fáil backbenchers as xenophobic and intolerant. It is important that we use language carefully and be aware of the sensitivity in our society, as it changes and becomes more multi-cultural, to intolerant or xenophobic remarks. It is important that the Government and this House give a lead in this regard. Intolerant and xenophobic remarks should be disowned. If we are to make a real pledge to the fulfilment of obligations under a human rights regime, we must begin by ensuring that the Members of this House comply with acceptable norms of behaviour in regard to human rights and the use of language.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a number of issues. Section 5 of the Bill deals with the structure of the commission. I hope the Minister will re-examine the character of the individual who will be <Col N="1070" /> president of the commission as that will be very important.</P>
    <P>Section 8 describes the functions of the commission. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, in its submission, sought the inclusion of the right to draft legislation among the commission's functions. That is a good idea. I do not see why any external group should not be able to propose draft legislation which we could consider. The Attorney General is well disposed to outside groups, such as the Law Reform Commission, drafting legislation and appending it to its reports rather than simply making recommendations.</P>
    <P>This Bill is extremely important but we have a great deal of work to do to make it better. My fear is that it is as narrow as it can be within the confines of our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. In essence, our response has been very tardy and minimalist. I hope that on Committee Stage we can broaden the Bill's scope. I particularly hope that the Minister's assertion of his near dismay at our unique position in the Council of Europe for not enacting the European convention into domestic law will be resolved and that we will have a much better Bill at the end of the process.</P>

      <P>I note that Deputy Howlin has used this debate as an opportunity to trumpet his party's fine record in the area of human rights. Without picking a fight, I want to say that had the Labour Party vindicated the rights of asylum seekers, it would not have been necessary for me, as a member of the Government, to raise this issue in public. Much of the acrimony which is coming from the Labour Party, in particular against me, is born of a guilt on its part for failing to take action to vindicate the rights of asylum seekers. Members of the party feel guilty about this and are, therefore, attacking the messenger. I merely want to put that on record.</P>

      <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for human rights, I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this most important Bill. The establishment of a human rights commission in this jurisdiction will represent another important step forward towards the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Quite apart from that, it will also demonstrate the Government's firm commitment to the creation of a vibrant and dynamic human rights culture, based on the highest international standards. Human rights involve relationships between individuals, and between individuals and the State. The practical task of protecting human rights is, therefore, primarily a national one for which each State is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all been greatly heartened by developments which have taken place in Northern Ireland of late and which, we hope, will shortly <Col N="1071" /> lead the way to the establishment of an inclusive executive and the other institutions under the Agreement, and to the achievement of decommissioning. There can be no doubt that the creation of the institutions will represent a massive step forward towards securing the full implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>However, while focusing on these developments, we should not lose sight of the importance of implementing the other parts of the Agreement, especially those relating to human rights and equality, which are at its very core. These are vital to the creation on this island of the new dispensation the Agreement envisages.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement, we did not approach human rights and equality as part of a nationalist agenda. All of us are stakeholders in the new society we are seeking to create and it is worth noting that this was an area where a broad consensus emerged among the parties at the talks, Unionists as well as Nationalists. As a result, the human rights and equality commitments in the Agreement are substantial and demanding, requiring action on the part of the two Governments, in particular, as well as the parties.</P>
    <P>The parties affirmed their commitment to rights that many of us take for granted &ndash; the right to free political thought and freedom of religion, to pursue democratically national and political aspirations and freedom from sectarian harassment. This represents a clear and powerful message from the parties that the abuses of the past in terms of civil and political rights have no place in the new future to be built together in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The British Government committed itself to, and has since provided for, the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into British law. It undertook to place a statutory obligation on public authorities in Northern Ireland to carry out their functions with due regard to the need to promote equality and has enacted the necessary legislation. It has also legislated for and established the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland and the new Equality Commission, both of which commenced operations earlier this year.</P>
    <P>For our part, we committed ourselves to further strengthening the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction to ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland. In particular, we undertook to establish a human rights commission &ldquo;with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within Northern Ireland&rdquo;. The Bill before the House not only fulfils that commitment, it goes significantly beyond it. In drawing up the specifications for what will be the first national institution of its kind in Europe, the Government was utterly convinced of the need to get it right.</P>
    <P>In approaching the task, the Government was informed by its belief that we should seek to create a body that would serve as a model from <Col N="1072" /> which other countries could draw inspiration, an example that people will look to when establishing their own institutions. We also had the benefit of the advice of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, who is taking a close personal interest in the establishment of this institution.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation, the commission will have a broad remit. The actual or potential strength of a national institution is directly related to its legal mandate and I would like to comment on some aspects of this mandate. The commission will be independent of Government in the performance of its functions. It will keep the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State under constant review. It will be able to consult international bodies with expertise in the area of human rights. It will recommend to Government measures to further strengthen human rights protection. It will promote awareness and understanding of human rights issues and will prepare and publish research. It will be able to offer assistance to individuals pursuing human rights cases in the courts and, where appropriate, to institute such proceedings itself. The commission will be able to conduct inquiries and, more importantly, in order to be in a position to conduct them effectively, it will be able to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant papers. It will also be able to provide advice to the courts on matters relating to human rights. In these last two regards, the commission's mandate goes beyond that of its Northern counterpart. Full realisation of human rights cannot be achieved solely through the development of protective law and the establishment of mechanisms to implement that law. National human rights institutions, along with intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, can play an important role in promoting human rights at domestic level. This role is essentially about informing and educating about human rights. It is crucial that the commission is given the resources to fulfil this function. Promotion and protection of human rights go together &ndash; this two-pronged approach cannot be split if the commission is to realise its full potential.</P>
    <P>A unique aspect of the commission's work will be the operation of the joint committee, together with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. The Agreement tasked the joint committee to consider the possibility of establishing a charter, open to signature by all democratic parties, reflecting and endorsing agreed measures for the protection of the fundamental rights of everybody living on the island of Ireland. This is an exciting development. It will involve no less than the creation of the human rights landscape of the Ireland of the future. The Northern Commission, in its draft strategic plan, has already given indications of how it proposes to approach this task. We must lose no time in doing likewise.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Government has ensured that the commission will be fully equipped with the <Col N="1073" /> tools it requires to carry out its task efficiently and effectively. In choosing to take as our point of departure the guidelines laid down by the United Nations, the Paris Principles, we have established rather than followed standards for international best practice in the field, as the Taoiseach in his statement on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights said in December of last year.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the most vulnerable members of our society see the commission as approachable, accessible and representative. The commission must be seen as an instrument of the people, not of the Government or the State. In discharging this and all the other responsibilities it will have, the commission will only be as good as its members. In making appointments, the Government shall have regard to the need to ensure that the members of the Commission include both men and women and are broadly representative of the make-up of our society.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains the requirement that only those with a real contribution to make, those who are suitably qualified by way of experience, qualification, training or expertise to fulfil the important role they will be asked to undertake, will be appointed as commissioners. We cannot deviate from this extremely important requirement. It is my hope that the selection process will be as open and transparent as possible and that consideration will be given to how we can attract the best people to offer themselves for this high public service. Once appointed, the commissioners must be given the means, in human and financial resources, to carry out their mandate. All our expressions of support will be mere rhetoric if we fail to give the commission the tools to do the job.</P>
    <P>Through the Good Friday Agreement we have set about creating a dynamic rights and equality culture on this island. We know that for Nationalists demonstrable progress on these issues will be as vital a sign that a new future built on justice and equality is possible as progress on the institutional aspects of the Agreement. For Unionists, the functioning of fully independent commissions, in both parts of the country, will demonstrate conclusively that human rights are for all.</P>
    <P>I hope the creation of a Human Rights Commission in this jurisdiction will make a real impact on the quality of life of all our people, especially the most vulnerable members of our society. It is the clearest possible indication of the Government's commitment to human rights and of its genuine willingness to take its international and domestic obligations seriously.</P>
    <P>In so doing, we will be participating in the active defence of human rights, which over the past 50 years has become a global secular religion, a credo which should permeate good governance in civilised countries. Whether we as a Government are dealing with young or old people, well established citizens or newly arrived refugees, prisoners, travellers or the homeless, this human rights perspective will inform and <Col N="1074" /> shape our policies for the better. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Ba maith liom fáilte a chur leis an mBille seo. Is céim eile an mBille chun Comhaontú Aoine an Chéasta a chur i bhfheidhm. Is mór an trua go raibh moill comh fada ar a mBille agus, de bharr sin, ar bhunú an chomisiúin.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which implements one of the essential elements of the Good Friday Agreement. The protection and promotion of human rights throughout this island is central to the Agreement and is something for which we in Sinn Féin argued very strongly during the course of the negotiations. We argued in the negotiations for an all-Ireland human rights commission which would have a 32 county remit covering both jurisdictions. That would still be our preferred option, but we endorsed the recognition in the Agreement, as concluded, of the need to establish human rights commissions in both the Six Counties and the 26 counties.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that it has taken so long for this Bill to come before the Dáil. The Human Rights Commission in the Six Counties is already established and it is unsatisfactory that there has been such a delay on this side of the Border. Having said that, the Bill and the new commissions offer us the opportunity to create a new focus on human rights in Ireland. There has been relatively little debate on this aspect of the Good Friday Agreement in the Six Counties and even less in this jurisdiction, but it is just as vital a question on this side of the Border.</P>
      <P>It is Sinn Féin's view that the success of the Agreement will be measured by the real change it brings about. Political progress is about political change and the Agreement will remain a document, nothing more, if the principles contained therein are not put into effect with practical application to people's daily lives. This is especially so in the area of human rights.</P>
      <P>The phase of conflict in Ireland which we are hopefully bringing to a close with the implementation of the Agreement began as the Nationalist people of the Six Counties raised their just demands for civil and human rights denied to them in the sectarian state there since partition. It was the violent reaction of the Orange state to the peaceful campaign for human and civil rights which put the gun yet again into Irish politics. The Unionist government had an appalling human rights record &ndash; internment without trial in every decade since partition and repressive legislation, which was the envy of apartheid South Africa. This was followed by direct rule from Westminster which imposed further harsh repression in legislation and on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Britain's human rights record in the North of Ireland since then has been appalling. It would not be possible in a short contribution such as this to detail the extent of human rights abuses by the British state in the Six Counties, but it includes the killing of more than 400 people by the RUC <Col N="1075" /> and the British Army, collusion of state forces with loyalist paramilitaries, torture in interrogation centres, the Diplock court system, the use of lethal plastic bullets, harassment of members of the Nationalist community on the streets and in their homes, the occupation of lands and buildings and the absence of a proper inquest system. The list goes on, but the point which must be stressed is that the forces which have carried out these violations of human rights and the laws which empowered them to act as they have done are, all too sadly, still in place.</P>
    <P>The Human Rights Commission in the Six Counties must address all those issues. It must be central to the creation of a new dispensation in civil society rooted in respect for human rights. The same applies in this jurisdiction. Successive Governments in this State have infringed the human rights of citizens through repressive legislation. My party has made a detailed submission to the committee to review the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1998, and related matters. We have highlighted the anti-human rights nature of that body of legislation and have called for its repeal.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I urged the Minister in this House to allow for a more widespread review than that being conducted by the committee and the new human rights commission will have an important role in this regard. Its remit is to maintain an overview of the extent to which human rights are protected at both constitutional and legal levels, to assess the adequacy of this protection and make recommendations to Government for the better protection of these rights. Any independent scrutiny of the Offences Against the State Acts on the basis of these criteria would find these Acts and their operation over decades by the Garda to be repugnant to basic principles of human rights. The new Human Rights Commission must address all aspects of human rights, not only those relating to the conflict. The rights of all citizens, but especially of minorities in our society, must be its concern. It must be a proactive commission, not only protecting but promoting human rights and acting as both a watchdog and an advocate for those who believe that their human rights have been violated.</P>
    <P>There are a number of shortcomings in the Bill which I want to highlight. Regarding the membership of the commission, it is regrettable that the Bill does not follow a similar route to the commission in the Six Counties. In the case of the Six Counties' commission, applications for membership were invited from suitably qualified persons, followed by interviews. This is far preferable to the appointment of nine people by the Government, as provided for in the Bill. Given the remit of the commission and the need for it to be independent and seen to be independent, this method of appointment is totally inappropriate. While it is not laid down in the Bill that a judicial figure has to be president of the commission, its provisions clearly create an expectation that this will <Col N="1076" /> be the case. This would be a mistake. The commission needs to be independent of the judiciary and needs to bring a fresh approach and a different perspective to the State's handling of human rights. I welcome the provision allowing the commission to conduct inquiries. This is a very important power and one I hope will be used proactively by the commission.</P>
    <P>One worrying aspect of the Bill in this regard is that the commission may postpone making a decision on a request for an inquiry if it considers that the subject matter of the request is already being considered by a court or tribunal. The problem is that it does not just contemplate legal proceedings in train, but also legal proceedings which are likely to be instituted in the future. If interpreted in a restrictive way by the commission, this could severely limit the number of requests granted.</P>
    <P>There is also a major difficulty with section 2. The definition of human rights for the purpose of legal proceedings by the commission is confined to those rights that can be argued before the courts on the basis that they have been incorporated into the law of the State. Since a whole range of international human rights instruments have not yet been incorporated into domestic legislation, this provision is very restrictive and should be addressed on subsequent Stages.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and I urge that the new Human Rights Commission should become one of the forces for progressive change in society at what is, after all, a very exciting time in our history.</P>

      <P>This has arisen from the Good Friday Agreement and Deputy Ó Caoláin would like me to include among the lists of human rights violations in Northern Ireland over many years &ndash; not just the last 30 &ndash; the punishment beatings and intimidation. Let us hope we are moving forward on both sides. With the help of the Human Rights Commission and the Agreement, these atrocities will be a thing of the past. If there is an attempt to inflict them on anyone on this island, this commission will have the power to deal with that and will also provide full accessibility for everyone. The commission embraces and will I hope enlarge fundamental principles of human rights and, as Deputy Ó Caoláin said, we must not be restrictive in any way &ndash; matters that may not be part of our legislation should be taken on board by the commission.</P>

      <P>I wish to declare an interest in this matter as I am a director of Urban North Dublin Regeneration Limited which is the body pursuing the building of the Darndale-Belcamp village centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> The Minister will be familiar with the history of the Darndale-Belcamp parish, which was built in 1974 and whose population of approximately 6,500 was effectively left without a commercial centre of any kind. It had not a chemist, post office, health centre, social welfare office or training or enterprise facilities. The result was a long history of transience and high unemployment which has been estimated by groups I worked with to have reached 70 per cent to 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 there has been a determined effort by the Darndale-Belcamp community to fight back on behalf of their estate. Dublin Corporation began an extensive refurbishment programme around this time to normalise each house, in effect, and to get rid of troublespots at open spaces and laneways. Over the years heroic work has been done by the Darndale Tenants and Residents Association, the Darndale Resource Centre, the Darndale-Belcamp Initiative, the parish priests and teams and the local community, especially with the support of Dublin Corporation and FÁS.</P>
    <P>Now the key piece in the jigsaw of the redevelopment of Darndale is before us, the Darndale-Belcamp village centre. This project was initiated by the community, which discovered the EU URBAN Programme and encouraged local representatives to pursue it at local, national and European level. The new centre was the subject of an architectural competition won by Duffy Mitchell and will have a new health centre, nursery and family centre, a community and training centre including an enterprise section and the Dublin Corporation regional office. We hope to have the new Dublin North Central Committee, which will represent 150,000 people, meeting there. There will also be a number of retail units, including a chemist and post office, as well as a number of accommodation units.</P>
    <P>The Minister will know we have put a package worth £7.1 million together with strong support from the Eastern Health Board, which has committed almost £2 million, while Dublin Corporation has committed £1.5 million. I pay tribute to the Dublin Corporation officers, particularly the URBAN programme manager, Paul Clegg, and the Darndale regional manager, George Perry. FÁS, under local manager John O'Gorman, has committed nearly £750,000, while the Department of the Environment and Local Government, under the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Finance, committed almost £750,000 to the project last year. Enterprise Ireland, through chief executive officer Dan Flinter, recently awarded the enterprise centre a grant of £564,000.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that to build and fit out this flagship for the EU URBAN Programme, which is being visited by our European colleagues, we need approximately £8 million and we have a shortfall of almost £1 million. Given next weeks' budget, I appeal to the Minister of State to ask the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Finance to ensure the full <Col N="1078" /> amount we need is in place, including £350,000 for fit-out. The Minister of State will be aware of a recent debate on the national development plan and the western area will get approximately £14,000 per person, while the eastern and southern area &ndash; the Ceann Comhairle's area &ndash; will only get £10,000 per head. It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure that highly deprived areas, especially in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, the urban centres, which may have unemployment rates of more than 60 per cent, receive major investment. I appreciate what the Ministers have done in the past and the great support of the agencies led by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The date 7 December will be a happy day for the 7,000 people of Darndale Belcamp and the surrounding areas when the builders move on site to start this project, which is due to take 54 weeks, and make the village centre a reality. However, we are still short of a key element of funding. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the total funding package for the village centre is in place. The mistakes of the 1970s must be remedied once and for all and this proud and hard working community should be informed that the Government and the local authorities have done their duty by them.</P>

      <P>The proposed new civic centre for Darndale in north Dublin is part of the URBAN initiative for the area and is a multidimensional response to the needs of the area. The centre will include an integrated enterprise centre, training centre, child care facilities, health centre, one stop shop, community resource centre, social housing and so forth.</P>
      <P>Following a pre-budget submission from Regeneration of Urban North Dublin Limited, ROUND, a sum of £700,000 towards the cost of the centre was announced in the 1999 budget and was provided in the Department of the Environment and Local Government Vote for 1999. This grant was based on the briefing document for the architectural competition for the centre which costed the centre at £4.9 million. Funding for the project is being provided from a number of sources, including the Eastern Health Board, Dublin Corporation, FÁS, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Enterprise Ireland, the Dublin City Enterprise Board and the URBAN initiative.</P>
      <P>Following the development of the design, certain changes were made to the proposal, including an increase in the circulation space, an increase in the size of the playschool area and the diversion of a water main. The overall cost of the centre is now estimated at £8 million. The Exchequer's original commitment to the project was £700,000, exclusive of the social housing provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the increased cost of the project, ROUND sought additional funding from the Department of the Environment and Local <Col N="1079" /> Government. The abridged Estimates for 2000 which were published earlier this month contain sufficient provision within the Estimate for the Department of the Environment and Local Government to cover the likely shortfall in the funding of the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. This is a serious problem at Carrowkerbla and Cloonagun about which I recently received representations. A number of families live along this road and the two bridges on it are the cause of the problem. These people cannot get modern machinery up the road. A business located on the road has great difficulty having goods delivered and this is affecting the owner's livelihood. The people who live in the area are also having a difficult time. They wrote to the Office of Public Works and asked that the regional engineer or some other representative of the Office of Public Works visit the area. The engineer did that and subsequently wrote to the residents to inform them that there were 2,000 similar bridges throughout the country and the most dangerous ones would have to be dealt with first.</P>
      <P>The people accept that argument. However, they were told it would be a number of years before the Office of Public Works would be able to deal with the bridge. The bridges are structurally sound. The residents are simply seeking that they be extended so they can travel more easily to their schools, churches, businesses and lands. What they are seeking is a necessity, not an extra. They cannot do their daily work because of the inadequacy of these bridges. If there are floods, there are further problems.</P>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who has responsibility in this area, would be present for this debate so I could urge him to speed up the process for these people. We hear about the Celtic tiger and how much money is available to the Government. This is what upsets people. The Government and its public relations people are telling everybody how well off they are and that there is no shortage of money. However, money appears to be an obstacle in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not cost the Office of Public Works a fortune to do this job. The Minister of State should instruct the Office of Public Works to give these six families an opportunity to conduct their daily business in a reasonable manner and be able to get in and out of their properties. The business there should be able to bring modern machinery up the road. I ask the Minister of State to instruct the Office of Public Works to extend these two bridges. It will not be costly. These families have had enough. They have made every effort to resolve the problem over the years and they are now confronted with officialdom at its worst. This <Col N="1080" /> work is a necessity as the bridges are causing a major problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to discuss this matter with the officials with a view to moving the project up the list. It is not good enough to be told it will be a number of years. It should be put into the programme for next year or, certainly, the year after. It would be wrong to put it on the long finger. It is wrong that people in rural areas do not have the same standard of living as people in other areas and this case is a typical example. I can no longer tell these people that there is no money in the kitty. The money is available; what is needed is the political will of the Minister of State to deliver on this. I ask the Minister of State to discuss this with his officials in the Office of Public Works and to make these bridges a priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, is abroad at an EU Finance Council meeting and is unable to be here this evening. The bridge to which the Deputy refers is part of the Moy catchment drainage scheme which was carried out by the Office of Public Works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. The scheme commenced in 1960 and was completed in 1971. It involved the drainage of 1,241 kilometres of channels.</P>
      <P>Some 2,200 accommodation bridges were modified or replaced as part of the scheme design. These bridges provide the riparian farmers owning land on both sides of a scheme channel with farm vehicular and-or foot access from one side to the other. The type of bridge provided depended on the width, depth and required flow capacity of the river channel, and ranged from concrete piped culverts to relatively large structures formed of concrete or masonry abutments spanned by structural steel beams or lattice girders together with concrete or timber decking.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works has a statutory obligation to maintain the scheme in proper repair and effective condition. This includes the examination of bridges as part of the maintenance works and repairs and replacements are carried out as necessary. The bridge in question was recently examined and found to be structurally sound. Consequently, there are no plans to replace it. However, the Office of Public Works has no objections to landowners enlarging the bridges themselves, provided they comply with Office of Public Works requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Asperger's syndrome is a developmental disorder related to autism where a person has subtle but serious handicapping impairments in his or her communications and social skills and pursues a narrow range of interests and routines in an intense, obsessional manner. To the man on the street, a person with <Col N="1081" /> Asperger's syndrome may just appear to be odd, eccentric or irritating. Their most notable characteristics are the absence of friends and their tendency to have obsessional interests, be it astronomy, cars or Star Trek.</P>
      <P>Sufferers have a serious lifelong disability which may be expressed as poor communications and social skills, clumsiness and hypersensitivity. The person frequently becomes deeply frustrated and may get paranoiac, depressive and violent, particularly when misunderstood. The individual sufferers, while in the autistic spectrum of disability, vary in the degree of severity of the condition but share common problems, for example, severe unease with society. They are frequently very unhappy and have extra problems from their teens to their late 20s. Their families carry a massive support burden, coping with behaviour which can be abusive and disabling, particularly without the intervention that is needed.</P>
      <P>There is no accurate research of this problem in Ireland, but national and international statistics put the incidence of Asperger's syndrome at one person in every 300. The occurrence is considered six times more common than classic autism and there is an estimated 10,000 sufferers in the State. Although it is more than 50 years since this condition was identified in Ireland, we &ndash; in particular, the mid-west region &ndash; lag behind other countries in treating it. There is poor diagnosis of the condition and, in some cases, it takes more than ten years to diagnose it. There is also poor education and training, there are not any specialised services to allow development and growth of sensitivity to the needs of the sufferers of the condition and there is not any residential or sheltered living facilities.</P>
      <P>The mid west region, with its concentration of teacher training, university employment and medical services is well placed to become one of the most appropriate areas to provide quality service for these people. The priorities are early diagnosis of the condition; appropriate education and training services geared to the special needs, especially of teenagers and young adults; small sheltered housing facilities with independent living, possibly for young adults; specialist services including medical, psychiatric, psychological and neurological, particularly for the 16 to 30 age group, which has the highest incidence of suicide; support for parents and families by meaningful respite facilities; and affordable conferences to inform and evaluate the current state of knowledge of the condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each area should adopt a co-ordinated approach to the services needed by those who suffer from Asperger's syndrome. Such an approach should be facilitiated by setting up a task force to deal with the disability, involving local authorities to provide social housing, teacher training colleges, universities, the Department of Education and Science and other interested parties. In particular, there is a need for better education at school and training at cen<Col N="1082" /> tral level to allow development and growth sensitive to the special needs of these people. Smallscale residential services or sheltered housing should be provided to allow these people a certain amount of independence, which most people want in their late teens. There is also a need for appropriate respite care, structured and closely monitored work placement opportunities to encourage moves towards independence and support should be provided by psychologists, psychotherapists, social workers and psychiatrists on an ongoing basis to assist the families of the sufferers of this condition.</P>
    <P>The people with this disability have suffered a great injustice in that they have been neglected over the past 50 years. We now have the knowledge, the resources and the possiblity to begin to right this wrong. By doing so, we would greatly improve the quality of life of thousands of sufferers and their families, but is there the political will to do that?</P>
    <P>Given that this condition is suffered mainly by children and young adults, I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the necessary resources will be made available to assist these people, bearing in mind that Asperger's syndrome was first identified in 1944. I implore the Minister of State and his Department to bring this neglected area to the fore and to assist the children and young adults suffering from this condition and their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and I respond to him on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. Asperger's Syndrome is a relatively new syndrome and it is not yet clear whether it is an entity on its own or whether it represents one end of the autistic spectrum. As with persons with autism, persons with Asperger's syndrome have great difficulty with social relationships. They are, however, not so obviously affected in terms of communication and behaviours as those with autism.</P>
      <P>In terms of treatment, the most important factor is early recognition and referral to the child psychiatric services. These is no specific cure available, but early diagnosis can lead to the provision of support and guidance for the affected child and his or her family. Likewise schools and teachers need to be informed of the condition so that appropriate remedial measures can be instituted. The recent expansion in the child psychiatric services has ensured that the condition is becoming increasingly recognised. However, because of its relative rarity an exact prevalence figure for Ireland is not yet available.</P>

    <P>Persons with Asperger's syndrome may reach adult life without the condition being diagnosed. They may then present with adjustment problems and need the help of psychiatric services. There is not general agreement as to whether they require a very specialised approach or whether they should be treated on an initial basis within the generic services. Group therapy has been advocated by one authority as the best approach. <Col N="1083" /> There is no specific treatment available. Again as with children, the most important factor is that the diagnosis be made and various supports be put in place.</P>
    <P>The provision of health related support services to persons with Asperger's syndrome is a matter in the first instances for the health boards. Given the possible link with the autistic spectrum, in some health board regions support for this group is being developed through the services for persons with autism. In particular, where children of school going age are identified, health related support services are provided, in the main, on an out-reach basis, in the same manner as those available to children with autism.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, was pleased to be in a position this year to allocate additional funding of £1.5 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £2.5 million in 2000, for the further development of health related support services for children with autism. This funding has been used to enhance early intervention, pre-school and out-reach services for children of school going age. This multi-disciplinary support includes speech and language therapy, psychological, occupational and physiotherapy services, nursing and social work support.</P>
    <P>The provision of educational services for children with special needs, including those with Asperger's syndrome, is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. He has expanded the range of services and supports provided by his Department for this group.</P>
    <P>The funding provided this year was part of an overall package of £12 million in 1999, with a full year cost of £18 million in 2000, allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism for the development of a range of residential, respite and day care services.</P>
    <P>Since his appointment as Minister for Health and Children, and despite the many competing demands that are made on the resources available to his Department, Deputy Cowen has consistently identified as one of his priorities the provision of additional residential, respite and day care services for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
    <P>The evidence of that commitment is demonstrated clearly by the level of additional funding, £53 million up to the end of 1999, increasing to £59 million in 2000, which the Minister has made available for these services since his appointment.</P>
    <P>The accelerated provision of further additional resources for these services remains one of the Minister's highest priorities and is being pursued by him in the context of the Estimates process for 2000 and the national development plan. I am confident that the Government's budgetary measures for the coming year will have due regard to the levels of need that have been identified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The report yesterday from the Environmental Protection Agency on the quality of our drinking water is one of the most disturbing reports to appear from a public body in recent years. Drinking water is essential for the continuity of life on our planet. In many parts of the world it is already under severe threat. In regions of the Third World contaminated water is one of the biggest sources of pestilence and disease and especially in major urban centres where there is poor sanitation it is unsafe to drink tap water. Who would ever have thought that the warning &ldquo;the water is unfit to drink&rdquo; or &ldquo;boil all water before drinking&rdquo; would be messages to be delivered to the heart of rural Ireland?</P>
      <P>Yesterday's EPA report reveals that 42 per cent of group water schemes contained coliform bacteria. In addition, it reveals that 8 per cent of public schemes are supplying water that is unfit to drink and that significant numbers of drinking waters are still bacteriologically unfit for human consumption. This is a frightening conclusion and requires urgent action.</P>
      <P>The response, however, from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the press statement issued through his Department, typically plays down the problem, even though he faces the prospect of being brought to court by the European Commission over the state of this country's drinking water.</P>
      <P>In his statement, the Minister said, &ldquo;The report confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water with 92 per cent of public supplies of acceptable standards.&rdquo;  The report does nothing of the kind. The reality is that one out of every 12 citizens is being supplied with a public water supply that is unfit for drinking. In his press release, the Minister also downplays the problems in group water schemes by stating that they service &ldquo;less than 5 per cent of households in the country&rdquo;. People on group water schemes should not be sidelined and treated as a minority. This significant section of rural Ireland has a right to expect the highest and safest standards of drinking water. I know the Minister will tell us about the £420 million being invested in the national development plan to address water quality, which I welcome. However, the issue is urgent and further immediate action should now be taken. The public should be informed about what group water schemes and public water supplies are unfit to drink. Citizens have a right to know if their drinking water is safe for themselves and their families. We need to know what taps are delivering water which is not safe to drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister to arrange for the publication of a list of group water schemes where the water is unfit to drink and to publish those sections of the public water supply where it is not safe to drink the water coming from the taps. I also call on him to set out a timetable to bring all the drinking water up to a safe standard. I ask <Col N="1085" /> him to take immediate action to identify and urgently address the causes and sources of contamination of drinking water. I ask him to state how and with what speed he intends to respond to yesterday's damning EPA report on drinking water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising this issue. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond and he asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that the Minister has taken on a series of initiatives to address this issue in a planned way since taking up office. This involves local authorities, the group scheme sector and rural organisations coming together in a spirit of partnership and co-operation to achieve a common objective, namely, to eliminate quality deficiency in rural water supplies. The Minister shares the Deputy's concerns about the unsatisfactory state of many group water scheme supplies. While the overall state of our public water supplies is satisfactory, there is no argument that there is a major problem with privately sourced group schemes.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable there is a downside to our unprecedented economic prosperity in the form of increased pressure on the environment. In today's world, quality drinking water is synonymous with treated water. The fact that many of the privately sourced schemes do not provide any form of treatment or disinfection lies at the heart of the problem. These schemes supply approximately 50,000 households from springs, wells or boreholes, many of which are vulnerable to pollution from a variety of sources. It is essential that vulnerable schemes are identified and appropriate measures are put in place to remedy the problem.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has embarked on a new approach aimed at improving the quality, reliability and efficiency of rural water supply schemes. A national rural water monitoring committee, comprising representatives of local authorities, the group sector, rural organisations and the Department, has been established to advise on policy and to monitor the implementation of the capital support measures under the rural water programme. Earlier this year the committee prepared a model strategic rural water plan which will be used by local authorities in drawing up, in a uniformed and standardised way, a rural water plan for each county. All counties are now compiling plans in partnership with key stakeholders at local level. These will set out an agreed strategy for supplying all rural areas with a satisfactory water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans alone will not address the acute water quality problems. New ways to eliminate organic <Col N="1086" /> pollution must be explored and tested. Money must be provided for this purpose and for the subsequent widespread application of appropriate technologies. Substantial progress is being made on both fronts.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister introduced a new water quality initiative aimed at identifying the causes of pollution in private group schemes, an examination of new technologies to treat problem supplies and the practical testing of appropriate technologies. An examination of new technologies by an international firm of consultants has recommended a number of new approaches to treating smallscale systems and these are being tested in a unique piloting arrangement involving local authorities and the group sector at 30 locations around the country. The Minister is confident that these innovative technologies will be highly effective and pave the way for an all-out assault on the pressing problem of water quality in group scheme supplies.</P>
    <P>Just three years ago annual expenditure on rural water amounted to £8.5 million. This year capital expenditure will be over £33 million, with a further £5 million being provided to assist with operational costs. The National Development Plan 2000-06 will ensure that the rapidly expanding rural water programme is properly resourced. Some £420 million will be provided under the plan to finance the implementation of strategies which will emerge under the county rural water plans. This is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to tackle head on the problems confronting the group scheme sector. It will be a matter for the main stakeholders at county level to prioritise the investment needs locally. It is the Minister's job to ensure that the necessary financial and administrative supports are in place to underpin locally agreed strategies and the House need have no worries in this regard.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of the commitment to resolve the quality problems in group schemes, the Department of the Environment and Local Government recently strengthened the legal basis for the monitoring of quality in the larger group schemes and the requirement to take remedial action where necessary. In an amendment to the 1988 drinking water regulations those responsible for these schemes will be required to draw up an action programme for the improvement of deficient supplies. This will be done in consultation with the relevant local authority within the overall participative framework of the rural water programme.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the breaches in water quality standards were generally not extreme and are of organic origin. They can be readily eliminated by better operation and management, coupled with suitable disinfection. The strategic approach outlined, together with the investment <Col N="1087" /> as proposed under the national development plan,   comprises   a   substantial  and  proactive</P>
    <P>response by the Government to the problems affecting rural group water supplies.</P>

      <QRef>[24664/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>(Dr. Woods): The Irish rope mussel industry has experienced significant growth since its emergence in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Total production in 1998 exceeded 8,000 tonnes and was valued at approximately £10 million. The industry is now an important source of employment and revenue for many coastal communities.</P>
    <P>The future success of the industry is critically dependent on the achievement of world class levels of food safety and product quality which will act as a crucial underpinning for customer and market confidence in the product. Bord Iascaigh Mhara was, therefore, asked to formulate, as a matter of urgency, proposals for the development and implementation of a total quality management system, for processed rope mussels.</P>
    <P>BIM has now drawn up proposals and plans which will, I believe, support and facilitate the development of a world-class safety and quality system for Irish rope mussels. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the necessary funding is being put in place for implementation of this important initiative, which will be carried forward by BIM in close co-operation with my Department and the industry.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is as I outlined to the House on 29 September 1999 and 7 October 1999. I would prefer if shipments of this nature did not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the Government is opposed not only to the transport of nuclear fuels by sea but also to the very existence of Sellafield. The question <Col N="1090" /> of a ban, however, on the passage of ships carrying nuclear materials is fraught with difficulties, given the right of innocent passage enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS.</P>
    <P>My main concerns regarding any transport of this nature are to ensure that the vessels concerned do not pass through waters under our jurisdiction. I have assurances from the UK authorities that they will not. The UK authorities have also stressed that voyages by such vessels through waters solely under UK jurisdiction are kept to a minimum and are already limited to one or two per year; to ensure that the highest possible levels of safety are applied both in terms of the vessels employed and the operational requirements applied to them.</P>
    <P>As Minister I have to accept that the vessels transporting these materials may be involved in an accident arising from hazards of navigation or from occurrences such as workplace accidents which will require assistance from Ireland's emergency services.</P>
    <P>In this connection the Irish Marine Emergency Service in consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland engaged recently in a communications exercise on board one of these vessels.</P>
    <P>As I have said I would prefer that these shipments were not happening at all. Nevertheless as Minister responsible for the marine environment and safety at sea, I am conscious of the fact that they are, for the present, a reality.</P>
    <P>In the light of this fact I have made arrangements with both the UK and France, bilateral agreements, that Ireland will be notified in advance of shipment dates, the nature of cargoes and all other relevant details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the aquaculture sector, has been underpinned by the Government and EU funding support from the start. Since 1994 under the current Operational Programme for Fisheries, some £11 million has been invested in the development and modernisation of aquaculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the sector moves into the new critical phase of expanding to critical mass over the period of the national development plan 2000-2006, £25 million of EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated under the regional programmes to ensuring that strategic objectives and targets to be set for the sector will be met. This exceptional investment support, over double the support provided in the current operational programme, underlines the Government's, and my, recognit<Col N="1091" /> ion of and commitment to the sector as a sustainable, natural resource based industry able to secure much needed quality jobs in rural, coastal and peripheral areas. As the national development plan points out, aquaculture production in both the Border, midlands, western and southern and eastern regions has significant further potential for sustainable development.</P>
    <P>Together with the State agencies directly involved, BIM and Údaras na Gaeltachta, the Department will have an important role to play in ensuring that the objective of balanced regional development is delivered in aquaculture via the management role assigned to it in the inter-regional operational programmes. Given the lead role for the regional operational programmes assigned to the proposed new regional assemblies for the border, midlands, western and southern and eastern regions, I look forward to co-operating fully with those bodies in taking forward a new framework strategic plan which will be developed in partnership with the industry.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I intend to publish very shortly the CIRCA report &ndash; a major strategic review of the aquaculture sector &ndash; which is currently being finalised. This report will be another key input into the strategic plan. Briefly at this juncture I would envisage that investment and other support strategies under the national development plan 2000-2006 will be targeted to maintain the momentum of the current operational programme and to deliver on the goals of critical mass, quality, sustainability, diversification, technology and cost competitiveness.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland along with five other states, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway, signed an international agreement in 1992 establishing the north-east Atlantic Loran-C network to provide a position fixing infrastructure for maritime navigation in the north-east Atlantic. To enhance the system's coverage and integrity, it was agreed that a station needed to be established at a westerly point in north-west Europe, preferably south-west Ireland. Following assessment of approximately 40 possible sites, Loop Head, County Clare was chosen on the grounds of providing maximum range and coverage, and minimum environmental impact.</P>
      <P>Because of public concerns about the project, I gave an undertaking that a full and comprehensive consultation procedure involving local groups would occur. To this end, I met with local interest groups in 1998 and in light of the concerns expressed and with a view to progressing the project, two studies were initiated: the Commissioners of Irish Lights, would assess a small number of sites containing existing masts in the south and south-west, and; technical studies were initiated by CIL and my Department on a possible configuration of the project to determine whether a lower mast with reduced power was a feasible and acceptable option.</P>
      <P>These studies are ongoing. They are intended to allow Ireland to meet its obligations under the international agreement, while at the same time, taking account of the need to minimise environmental impacts. The studies are complex, necessitating thorough technical analysis of options for delivering on Ireland's legal obligations. The Government remains committed to the international agreement which was endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is also committed to a consultation process in respect of the studies mentioned above and any other consideration of the matter, which the Government may decide to initiate.</P>

      <P>The development of our marine sector is highlighted in the Government's revised An Action Programme for the Millennium, published in November, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> The programme gives unique recognition to the strategic importance of our shipping industry and commits to establishing a national maritime college, together with the Irish maritime development office and a national port users forum.</P>
    <P>I have already delivered on the commitment to set up the maritime development office having published the new legislation to set that body up on a firm statutory basis. For the first time in the State's history the shipping industry and the onshore shipping services sector will have its own dedicated development office which will be fully funded and staffed.</P>
    <P>The remit of the maritime development office will be both wide and far reaching. Under the terms of the new legislation it will promote and assist the development of Irish shipping and Irish shipping services; promote Ireland as a centre for ship registration; develop and implement a strategic framework for the shipping industry and its ancillary services sector; liaise with and support the shipping and shipping services industry; and advise on policy initiatives and on the overhaul of the fiscal and legislative framework for the mercantile marine in order to underpin industrial development and safeguard and generate employment.</P>
    <P>My purpose in setting up the Irish maritime development office is not just to encourage the growth of the Irish merchant fleet, it is also to facilitate the growth in Ireland of a wide range of shipping related services; ship financing, manning, insurance, chartering, brokerage and maritime legal services. These will be based both on the development of existing Irish services and on the attraction of such services from abroad.</P>
    <P>Very shortly I will put to Government, for implementation, a fully costed and developed plan for the new national maritime college. A new college, specifically focused on maritime education, will undoubtedly greatly increase the attractiveness of careers at sea and in the shore based maritime sector.</P>
    <P>In terms of moving the industry forward, I am pursuing a structured and inclusive approach following consultations with all the representative bodies and interests in the shipping industry.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in recent years I have been able to secure a range of fiscal reliefs for both seafarers and their employers. The scheme to refund employers of seafarers the portion of the social insurance contribution they pay in respect of their seagoing employees, was extended this year for a further four years to 2004. The special £5,000 seafarers income tax allowance, introduced in 1998, has this year been extended to seafarers servicing our offshore sector in Irish waters and I am looking to boost this further to achieve more productivity and improve competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to press the case for incentives and fiscal measures beyond what is already in place in terms of corporation tax, income tax allowances for seafarers and PRSI refunds to employers. I will also consider the possibilities for <Col N="1094" /> modifying the existing reliefs to make them both more attractive and more effective.</P>
    <P>I am keeping a close eye on the tonnage tax situation and especially developments on that front in the UK. This is also being factored in to ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I will launch a video and brochure tomorrow to encourage our young people to take up careers at sea and pursue professional educational and training courses in the maritime area. I intend to have copies of the video placed with every career guidance teacher and available to interested students.</P>
    <P>As we approach the millennium the Irish maritime sector is well positioned for the future and can capture real opportunities and generate new and sustainable jobs at home and abroad.</P>

    <P>I recently met with the board of the company referred to by the deputy and impressed on them my expectations for the use of Irish workers and goods and services in their operations in this country. While exploration and production companies have of course employed, and continue to employ, Irish workers in offshore exploration and development, particularly in the Kinsale Gas Field, I nevertheless wish to reiterate that it is Government policy to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities, within the <Col N="1095" /> constraints of EU legislation. As I have said before, I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services, including service ports, must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so. I have designated Enterprise Ireland to act as facilitator between operators of petroleum exploration licences and Irish providers of goods and services.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated in the House, responsibility as regards employment of workers and indeed the provision of services and related issues, including the selection of service ports for offshore operations, are strictly matters for the exploration companies and their contractors. There are no powers available to me to require undertakings in regard to jobs or the provision of services with the oil companies involved in offshore petroleum exploration activities. The imposition of such conditions on licence holders is precluded under EU legislation in force since 1968 (Regulation 1612/68) in relation to the freedom of movement of workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The key recommendations of the herring task force have been fully implemented. The quality training programmes for the dry-hold herring fleet and for the herring processing sector have been completed. The industry-led Herring Industry Marketing Group, which will develop and co-ordinate industry strategies to maximise returns to the herring sector and to act as a forum for dialogue and concerted action, has been established for some time. In this regard, of particular advantage has been the recent appointment of a pelagic market co-ordinator, recommended by the task force, who is now working with the industry on the ground to further develop market co-ordination and co-operative strategies for the herring industry.</P>
      <P>A key recommendation of the task force was that market research and fishing trials should be undertaken to identify new fisheries and optimum fishing times and opportunities for herring in terms of roe, maatje and fillet markets. These trials have been completed and the results are being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also provided grant aid towards feasibility research and development trials into alternative loading and unloading systems and technical gear innovations. The task force underlined the importance of loading and unloading systems <Col N="1096" /> and gear in the maintenance and improvement of product quality and returns. This work is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that industry participation in the management of the herring fisheries should be enhanced by the management advisory committee. This has also been implemented, in consultation with the industry, through the setting up of committees in the Celtic Sea and north west herring fisheries.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that the necessary strategies to deliver and resource herring assessment and survey programmes should be put in place. At my request the Marine Institute extended its herring catch sampling programme and resumed acoustic surveys. I also asked the Institute to develop a practical partnership approach with the industry including participation by fishermen in stock assessment programmes.</P>
    <P>The remaining recommendations made by the task force are also being actively progressed. these include the development of funded research and development programmes and the carrying out of studies into herring offal use, the investigation into the potential markets for herring milt, management and conservation initiatives for the north west herring fishery, adjustments to the management regime in the Celtic Sea fishery, a review of market support regimes and funding of fish processing projects.</P>
    <P>There are continuing difficulties in the market for Irish herring producers and processors. These difficulties are due primarily to external factors over which we have no control. The implementation of the recommendations of the task force report are an important step in strengthening the Irish industry. The focus will continue to be on developing new market opportunities and maximising quality and competitiveness in order to deliver best possible prices for Irish product.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Oil and their partners Saga Petroleum, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Limited have drilled three wells in the Corrib gas accumulation located in the Slyne Trough, an exploration well in 1996 and two appraisal wells, one in 1998 and the second this year.</P>
      <P>The exploration well was a gas discovery well but the operator was unable to test it at the time. The first appraisal well produced gas on test which flowed at a stabilised rate of 63 million cubic feet of gas per day. The second appraisal well flowed gas at a rate of 64 million cubic feet per day and was successfully completed in August 1999. The data acquired by the operator, which has been made available to my Department, is being evaluated by the licensees. However, I understand that additional appraisal work is required and that a further appraisal well may be necessary before it can be determined whether the field is commercial.</P>
      <P>The final decision as to whether the field is commercial will depend on factors such as the size of the field, the quality of the reservoir, the quality of the gas, flow rate of the well, the market price and the cost of development of the field. It is not possible to give precise figures for the size of the gas accumulation at the stage and this will not be possible until the accumulation has been fully appraised. The Deputy will appreciate that all data from the well must remain confidential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the global market situation for herring continues to be very worrying. The difficulty is due mainly to oversupply on the European market due to the importation of low price herring from Norway.</P>
      <P>My Department and BIM are working closely with the Irish fish processors and exporters to maximise all possible market openings for Irish herring, notably in Eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force on the management and marketing of herring recommended a series of measures, including the appointment of the pelagic market co-ordinator, to maintain and enhance the Irish herring exports in the very difficult global environment. The co-ordinator is now working with the industry on the ground to further develop market co-ordination and co-operative strategies for the herring industry. All these have already been implemented or are in progress including quality development programmes for the fleet and herring processors, an Industry Marketing Group, market research and new product <Col N="1099" /> development. These initiatives will help the industry through the present difficult market situation and position it well for development in future.</P>
    <P>In the present scenario the Department is also working with the industry to facilitate the take-up, as appropriate, of the existing EU market support schemes. The schemes allow for the withdrawal from the market of herring when the minimum withdrawal price for sale is not reached and the payment of a subsidy where product is held over with a view to reintroducing it to the market at a later stage.</P>
    <P>On the European level, I was successful at council on Monday, 22 November in stopping the Commission's proposal to allow unlimited quantities of fresh, chilled or frozen herring products at preferential rates of duty into the Community. I secured agreement to limit import quantities to 20,000 tonnes per annum from 2001-2003 and ensured that there was no increase on existing quantities. The terms of the agreement excludes filleted herring, restricts imports to larger sizes and limits imports to the period between 1 November and 31 December. Critically, I secured agreement on a review clause under which the Commission may take action to remedy serious disturbances on the EU herring market, including a review of the preferential imports.</P>
    <P>These are difficult times on the herring front and the difficulties are due primarily to external factors over which we have no control. In that difficult scenario the focus will continue to be on developing new market opportunities and maximising quality and competitiveness in order to deliver best possible prices for Irish product.</P>

      <Quest>and Natural Resources the success of the vessels which were grant aided under the modernisation of the white fish fishing fleet in fishing for non-quota species, for example, blue ling, grenadiers and scabbard; and the commerciality of these species for the fishermen involved.</Quest>

      <P>The whitefish fleet renewal programme which I launched in June 1998 supports up to £60 million investment in the fleet involving some £15 million in grant aid. Contracts for new vessels under the programme vessels were signed in March 1999 and new vessels are due to come on stream during 2000 when the new vessels will commence targeting these species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the programme for the renewal of the whitefish fleet, strong emphasis is put on developing non-quota opportunities including blue ling, grenadiers and scabbard. In line with the terms of the programme, it is envisaged that the larger new whitefish vessels will actively participate in developing national track record in the non quota deepwater species. Two vessels from <Col N="1100" /> the existing fleet were quite successful last year in targeting greenland halibut, redfish and grenadiers.</P>
    <P>I also provided funding for BIM to carry out fishing trials on deepwater non quota species. The trials to date show that successful commercialisation of deepwater non quota species is achievable. These trials are set to continue in 2000, targeting a variety of fishing grounds and non-quota species. I am confident that the programme will generate further incremental increases in Irish landings of deepwater non quota species which have increased from 1,000 tonnes in 1990 to 3,000 tonnes in 1998.</P>

I am arranging for a copy to be placed in the Oireachtas Library as well as a copy to be sent directly to the Deputy. In addition I will ensure that the report is circulated to as wide a range of interested groups as soon as possible including all parties which made submissions to the action group. The final report is due by the end of February 2000 and I am confident that the action group will respect this deadline in the same timely manner that it met the deadline of mid-November 1999 for the interim report.</P>
      <P>The action group's interim report makes a number of recommendations and suggestions and I would like to highlight just two of them at this stage.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the action group has identified some measures in relation to young persons as needing urgent attention, including a recommendation that persons under the age of 16 must wear appropriate lifejackets when on board open boats or on deck. The need to ensure the safety of children and young persons on the water must be paramount and I will be acting on these recommendations as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The action group has clearly indicated that powers for local authorities should be the primary response to controlling the use of jet skis and other fast craft. I intend to move quickly to ensure that the legislation required to make these powers available is prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that, when a body makes application to my Department for a foreshore lease, licence or permission under the Foreshore Acts 1933-1998, the application and supporting documents are considered by my Department and its specialist advisors. Where appropriate, the Marine Institute and the Central and-or relevant regional fisheries board are also consulted. All applications and supporting documentation are also copied to Dúchas to ascertain if, having regard to its statutory obligations to protect special areas of conservation, habitats, national monuments, including marine archaeological artefacts, etc. it has any objection in principle to the proposed development.</P>
      <P>Assuming that there is no objection in principle from either my Department or the other consultees any further information required is obtained from the applicant and the matter is then put to public consultation. Where the development is of a minor nature the consultation period is one of 21 days or, where an environmental impact statement, is required, a statutory one month period is required. Following the consultation period any objections or comments communicated to my Department are copied to the applicant for a response. Both objections and comments and the applicant's response thereto are considered by the Department and its specialist advisors. When this process is completed my officials make a submission to me in which they outline the detail of the proposed development, summarise the content of the objections and the applicant's response and make a recommendation. After careful consideration I make my decision in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This outlines the process which is being undertaken in the case of the proposed reclamation of 21 hectares in Dublin port. The EIS has been published. The port company advertised its intention and the availability of documentation for inspection in both <i>The Irish Times </i>and <i>Irish Independent</i> on 1 October. The documentation was available for inspection at both the company's offices and Store Street Garda Station. Over 400 objections or observations have been received and have been copied to Dublin Port Company for its response. When the company's response has been received it will be considered in conjunction with the comments and objections. I <Col N="1102" /> should stress that, while the bulk of the comments have opposed the proposed development, there have been a number in favour.</P>
    <P>As the foreshore in question is owned by the port company what is required under the Foreshore Acts for the reclamation is a foreshore permission. My remit in the case of a foreshore permission is confined solely to considering the implications for navigation, fishing and the environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The review document is an extension of, and not in substitution for, the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium. The commitments made in relation to flagships remain.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House previously, I am giving every priority to mounting, through strict enforcement, an effective ban on the illegal activities of flagships, and of all fishing vessels irrespective of nationality, in the Irish zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in supporting important new developments in the field of fisheries control. Ireland pushed strongly at the December 1998 council for the adoption of improved monitoring and inspection measures. The new fisheries control regulations which were adopted at that council came into force on 1 July this year and significantly enhance our ability to monitor and inspect flagships in particular. The regulations require flagships to provide a minimum of four hours notice of landings when using a landing location in a member state other than the flag member state. The regulations also extend monitoring of fishery products from the moment of landing until the final marketing stage and provide for enhanced co-operation on fisheries control between member states. In this regard I am pleased to say that arrangements which I have put in place with the UK and Spanish authorities concerning improved co-operation, liaison and information exchange in relation to inspection operations are paying dividends. The success of this joint approach sends a clear signal that illegal fishing will not be tolerated and that the member states concerned are increasingly pre<Col N="1103" /> pared to work together to ensure compliance with the rules.</P>
    <P>In addition to the considerable tightening up of the regulations, our fisheries protection services at sea and on land are co-operating closely to ensure that flagship activities in the Irish zone are rigorously monitored and controlled.</P>
    <P>The package of measures which I have outlined significantly enhance our ability to monitor and control the fishing activities of all vessels including flagships and will help to ensure that wherever fishermen land their catches they will be subject to the same level of control.</P>

The strategic plan for the sector, Growing for the Future envisages new planting of 20,000 hectares per annum in the coming years and I am satisfied that sufficient land will be available to meet the planting targets. <Col N="1104" /> It should be noted that there are almost one million hectares of wet mineral soils currently in use for farming which are particularly suited to forestry.</P>
      <P>Some £500 million has been earmarked for the afforestation programme under the National Development Plan. I would also point out that discussions with the European Commission are at an advanced stage in relation to my proposals to increase the level of afforestation grants and premiums. I can confirm that the increased rates, when agreed, will benefit all planting which takes place during the current season. I am also in the process of ensuring that there will be greater compatibility between forestry and other farm supports such as REPS under the new rural development programme.</P>

    <P>The central board informs me that the TAM Management Committee approved funding in respect of one of the three elements of this proposal submitted by the eastern board subject to the tourism potential of the small stretch of river involved being assessed. The amount of funding involved was £6,600.</P>
    <P>The central board further informs me that in February 1999 the eastern board confirmed that it did not wish to accept the funding of £6,600 for the reason that the element of the project which had been approved did not, on its own, constitute value for money.</P>

      <P>The introduction of administration charges arose as a consequence of Government policy in the late 1980s to reduce the national debt. One of the elements of Government policy at that time was the imposition of charges for services which had until then been provided free by the State.</P>
      <P>In 1993 the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Office of the Attorney General raised doubts about the legality of the charge. The position was not clear-cut however, with the Attorney General's office pointing out that basing the charge on actual administrative costs rather than a standard 5 per cent of grant would have a bearing on the matter.</P>
      <P>The issue was definitively settled following a communication from the European Commission in January 1995 in which the Commission informed all member states that the imposition of offset and administration charges was unacceptable. Accordingly, there will be no repeat of these problems. Shortly after assuming my current office I decided that all administration charges should be refunded.</P>

      <P>The Government will continue to develop Ireland's marine resources including the mercantile marine sector to maximise their contribution to economic and social well-being.</P>
      <P>The revised An Action Programme for the Millennium makes a commitment to the promotion of the maritime sector in particular by establishing a national maritime college and a maritime development office.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a Bill putting the new MDO on a firm statutory footing was introduced today. The new MDO will promote, assist and market shipping and shipping services, promote Ireland as a centre for ship registration, advise me on policy initiatives and on the overhaul of the fiscal and legislative framework for the mercantile marine.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new national maritime college is a also a key commitment in the revised action programme.</P>
      <P>An expert interdepartmental working group which I set up to examine the costings, financing and timing of the new maritime college is currently finalising its work. Before it completes its report to me for submission to Government the group is examining an independent consultant's report assessing the feasibility of a possible public private partnership approach to the design, build, financing and operation of the new national maritime college. I am advised that the group will finalise its report and submit it to me very shortly which will enable me to bring a fully developed and costed proposal to Government for consideration and decision.</P>
      <P>We have also secured a range of fiscal reliefs for both seafarers and their employers; a scheme to refund Employers of seafarers the PRSI they pay in respect of seafarers has this year been extended to 2004; a special £5,000 seafarers income tax allowance, introduced in 1998, has this year been extended to seafarers servicing our offshore sector in Irish waters; and beneficial rates of corporation tax remain in place for shipping.</P>
      <P>In ongoing discussions with the Minister for Finance we are considering the case for incentives and fiscal measures beyond what is already in place and we are looking closely at the possibilities of modifying the existing reliefs to make them both more attractive and more effective. We are also closely monitoring the introduction of tonnage taxes in other member states and especially developments on that front in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In collaboration with the Irish Chamber of Shipping we are initiating a publicity campaign tomorrow to encourage our young people to take up careers at sea and pursue professional educational and training courses in the maritime area. A custom made video and brochure will <Col N="1107" /> form the centrepiece of the campaign. I intend to have copies placed with every career guidance teacher and available to interested students.</P>
    <P>In terms of moving the industry forward, I am pursuing a structured and inclusive approach following consultations with all the representative bodies and interests in the shipping industry.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that as we approach the millennium the Irish maritime sector is well positioned for the future and can capture real opportunities and generate new and sustainable jobs at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>The attraction of inward investment to particular counties is a day to day matter for IDA Ireland and not one in which I have a direct function. I am arranging for IDA Ireland to advise the Deputy of its specific activities in promoting inward investment to the Monaghan and Cavan areas.</P>
      <P>There is now a greater emphasis by the industrial development agencies on the regional dispersal of investment projects. The Border region, including the Monaghan and Cavan areas, is a particular priority location for promotional purposes by IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's focus on regionalisation in general, and on Border counties in particular, reflects the Governments commitment in this regard and ensures that maximum grant support will be made available to any appropriate project which may choose to locate in the area.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I met with a delegation from Cavan County Council, including Cavan Oireachtas members, to specifically address the need for inward investment to Cavan. Representatives from IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland attended this meeting also. I emphasised the Government's desire to see substantial levels of increased investment into the Border area in general and I reiterated my commitment to ensuring that the agencies under my remit will remain closely focused on this. IDA Ireland as part of its new focus on the regions is seeking to deliver more than 50 per cent of all newly approved greenfield jobs to the Objective 1 region, which includes Monaghan and Cavan. This compares with 25 per cent of projects which were being brought to this region in the past.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year, as part of its efforts to monitor the effectiveness of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997, my Department contacted all Departments, some public bodies and the representative organisations of business. Essentially my Department was trying to ascertain the extent of the difference, if any, which the Act has made in speeding up payment practices. As a result of that exercise, my Department obtained very positive feedback on the operation and effectiveness of the Act. I am satisfied that the situation in relation to payments by the public sector has improved significantly since this legislation was put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to extending the scope of the legislation to cover the private as well as the public sector. Agreement has been reached at Council level on a proposed EU draft Directive on Late Payment in commercial transactions, which will apply to both the public and private sectors. I envisage, therefore, that the prompt payment legislation will be extended to cover all sectors of the economy in due course. I consider that these developments will be of bene<Col N="1109" /> fit to all business in Ireland, particularly small business.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any specific complaints in the building sector as referred to in the question. As regards the machinery for enforcement, section 8 of the Act was intended to provide an easily accessible mechanism for the resolution of disputes through arbitration with the agreement of the parties. It is always open to parties in dispute to bring a case to the civil courts. I do not consider that the exercise of these options is either unduly costly or cumbersome.</P>

      <P>I met the president and chief executive of the Irish Stock Exchange on 1 November 1999 at their request, arising from the exchange's consultations with investors, listed public companies and other relevant bodies in relation to the disclosure of directors' pay and remuneration in such companies. The exchange proposed to me that individual disclosure be made for two persons, namely, for each chief executive and for the highest paid director, excluding the chief executive, while the pay and remuneration of the remaining directors would be disclosed in aggregate only. I was advised that full disclosure of directors' remuneration could damage the marketing of the exchange, if Irish requirements were too far ahead of its competitors.</P>
      <P>It would be true to say that the exchange's views and mine remain divergent. I indicated to its representatives that full disclosure for each named director is a desirable development. It is in the best interests of all the members of a company that the annual reports of Irish registered and listed companies show the remuneration packages paid to individual directors and I would prefer to see the exchange's rules on disclosure being revised voluntarily rather than being dealt with through legislation.</P>
      <P>The exchange's representatives undertook to have the matter discussed again at a forthcoming meeting of the board of the exchange, and they will let me know the outcome at that stage.</P>

      <P>In the Estimates for next year, my Department is providing Iarnród Éireann with £100 million for rail safety investment under the Railway Safety Programme 1999-2003. Under the programme, the work is being carried out in a systematic way in line with the recommendations contained in the IRMS rail safety study. Thus, while an amount of the investment will be made in the Waterford area the funding is not being allocated on a county by county basis and I cannot provide the Deputy with a precise figure at this stage.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department will provide a capital grant of £45 million for a public transport investment programme to be carried out by the three CIE operating subsidiaries in 2000. While Waterford will undoubtedly benefit from this programme, the details of expenditure under the programme have not yet been settled.</P>
      <P>The sum of £10 million is being allocated to the regional airports under the national development plan 2000-2006. While funding has not been specifically earmarked for any individual airport at this stage, my Department will, over the coming months, be examining the proposals from each of the airports, including Waterford, with a view to prioritising investment needs over the period 2000-06.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> This examination will entail seeking and evaluating the detailed plans which the regional airport companies have for improvements which are deemed necessary to ensure the safe and viable operation of the airports. Decisions will only be taken in relation to the disbursement of funds in the national development plan after that exercise is complete.</P>
    <P>Under the economic infrastructure operational programme, IR£118,135 has been allocated to Waterford Internet Centre Limited for investment in e-kiosks in the south east and a further IR£103,400 has been allocated to Eircom for the development of a broadband network between Ardmore, County Waterford and Youghal, County Cork as part of a broadband access project. Both of these projects are due for completion during 2000.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the availability of funding for Waterford under the national development plan. The position in relation to my Department is that we will be involved in the draw down of funding under the National Development Plan covering the period 2000-06 in a number of areas, for example, (i) on farm capital investment; (ii) aid for the food processing sector; (iii) small scale rural enterprises, on and off farm; and (iv) REPS, early retirement and compensatory allowances. The major schemes at (i) and (ii) above will operate nationally under the proposed productive investment inter-regional operational programme with the rural enterprise type measures at (ii) above operating in the two regional programmes, for the border, midland and western region and the southern and eastern region, including Waterford. As regards the measures at (iv), they will be operated under a separate national CAP rural development programme.</P>
      <P>It is not planned to allocate funds for the above measures on a specific county basis but farmers and rural dwellers in Waterford will benefit under the proposed measures, as appropriate, during the seven year implementation period of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>As referred to in my response to the Deputy's Question No. 301 of 30 September 1998, the advisory group on quarantine established by the UK Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recommended that the quarantine system in place should be replaced by a system involving vaccination, blood-testing and microchip identification requirements for dogs and cats travelling between Great Britain and the member states of the European Union, the European economic area or rabies-free islands.</P>
      <P>In the light of the group's report and prospective developments in the UK, I initiated a review of Ireland's quarantine system, as changes contemplated in the UK system of quarantine controls would clearly hold potential for Ireland, given the common approach to rabies controls which both countries have followed over many years. I furthermore advised the Government that changes were likely in the UK which would have implications for Ireland and that I would in due course make recommendations to the Government on the approach Ireland should follow. The UK authorities subsequently publicly confirmed their intention to introduce a new control regime, along the lines recommended by the report, with effect from early 2001. They have also indicated their intention to run a pilot scheme in early 2000 which would provide experience of the practical workings of the new regime on a limited scale.</P>
      <P>In order to accommodate the proposed pilot scheme in the UK within the common approach which has hitherto operated between Ireland and the UK, I will shortly make proposals to the Government.</P>

      <P>Where a child receives an inheritance or gift from a parent and has received no previous gifts or inheritances from any source since 2 December 1988, a tax free threshold of £192,900 applies for capital acquisitions tax purposes.</P>
      <P>Children adopted under the law of a foreign state, where the adoption is recognised in Ireland, have the same rights as any child adopted in the state and can avail of this threshold of £192,900.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Department of Health and Children that there are a number of children in Ireland who have been adopted in foreign jurisdictions by what is known as simple adoption. These adoptions are different in nature and <Col N="1118" /> legal effect to full adoption which is the type of adoption arrangement in this country. The Irish statutory system for the recognition of foreign adoptions does not provide for the recognition of such adoptions.</P>
    <P>However, I understand that the Department of Health and Children is preparing legislation to ratify the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption. The question of simple adoptions is being considered in this context as article 27 of the convention makes provision for a mechanism to convert simple adoptions into full adoptions in the receiving country.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he will write to the Irish Medicines Board requesting that it reviews the advice previously furnished to his Department in view of the large number of people who have questioned the need to regulate, by prescription, the sale of herbal remedies or products such as St. John's Wort; and if he will consider in the context of any review that the new regulations which come into force on 1 January 2000 should be amended and herbal remedies excluded from their application.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is aware of the concerns which have been expressed regarding its recent recommendation that medicinal products containing St. John's Wort, hypericum perforatum, should be subject to prescription-only control.</P>
      <P>In relation to herbal medicinal products generally, I have been advised that the IMB has informed the alternative-complementary health industry that it is open to dialogue and proposals for different approaches in regard to regulating products in this area provided such approaches are consistent with legal obligations and the protection of public health. In this context, the board has recently approved the concept of setting up a working group to review the regulation of herbal medicinal products which will include representatives of a range of interested parties, including the health food industry. I understand that the board has recently contacted potential participants to determine the level of interest.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that the placing of any medicinal product under prescription only is carried out in the interest of protecting public health and safety and where it is considered appropriate that such products should be used only under medical supervision and advice. The criteria concerned are included in EU council directive 92/26/EEC concerning the classifications for supply of medicinal products for human use and the IMB would have had regard to those criteria in forming its opinion about products containing St. John's Wort.</P>

      <P>Details of the 27 applications submitted by Cork County Council to my Department for consideration under the EU co-financed scheme of grants in 1999 and the amount of funding sought for each project is set out in Table 1. Table 2 details the eight Cork County Council projects selected for funding in 1999 totalling £3,230,000. Applications are assessed in my Department with regard to the EU eligibility criteria, competing demands from other local authorities and the funds available; prioritisation is not sought from the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a grant under the EU co-financed specific grants scheme, a project must satisfy the EU eligibility criteria, which means that it must have a demonstrable impact on employment and promote rural development-agriculture or economic activity in industry, tourism, agriculture, fisheries or forestry.</P>

      <P>As far as my Department is concerned the main area of capital expenditure would relate to information technology. At this time there are no plans for capital expenditure on information technology projects in the Waterford constituency during 2000. However, the information systems division of my Department reviews business and technology requirements for <Col N="1124" /> all areas on an ongoing basis and schedules its work and procurement programme accordingly.</P>
      <P>The costs of capital projects for building or refurbishing offices used by the Department are borne by the Office of Public Works. No new expenditure of this nature is planned for 2000 in respect of the Department's Waterford offices.</P>

      <P>Under the relevant social welfare legislation, a person who claims unemployment benefit is not normally paid for the first three days, which are known as waiting days. Where, however, the person had a claim in respect of the scheme within the previous 13 weeks, payment may be made from the first day of the claim.</P>
      <P>The person concerned made a claim for unemployment benefit on 26 October 1999. As more than 13 weeks has elapsed since his most recent previous claim, three waiting days were applied to this claim and the level of unemployment benefit payable in his case was adjusted accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1125" /> Waiting days have been a feature of unemployment benefit and other welfare schemes since their inception and are a feature of similar social security schemes in many countries. There are no</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance. She has £4,000 in a credit union account which has been assessed in the manner set out above to give her weekly means of £7. This assessment entitles her to payment of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £65, maximum short-term personal rate of £72 less £7 means. Should her circumstances change, it would be open to the person concerned to apply for a review of her means. I am reviewing the current method of assessing capital. Any change in this regard would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

    <P>The number of inspectors as of 1 November 1999 is 409. The total cost of this service, including remuneration and other costs, is approximately £10.9 million.</P>
    <P>As well as the investigations arising from claims to social welfare payments and reviews of claims, the duties of inspectors include inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, and the investigation of cases of suspected fraud or abuse of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of staff on investigation duties in the period since 1991 reflects the increase in workload over that time. While the numbers in receipt of unemployment payments have reduced, there have been significant expansions of other schemes and additions of new schemes over the period. There has also been a significant increase in the level of control activities undertaken by inspectors over the period with extra staff being assigned for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The deployment of staff is a matter for management having regard to the requirements of each area and the need to ensure a good quality of service. There are no plans at present to reduce the number of staff involved in investigation work.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded an invalidity pension in 1992 and is currently in receipt of the maximum rate of £75.20 per week. In September 1998 it came to attention that he was employed on a community employment scheme while continuing to claim his pension. Following further investigation it was established that he had been employed since 23 March 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> The rules of behaviour for receipt of invalidity pension require that a person refrains from working. However, exemption from this rule can be granted in certain circumstances, including situations where application is made by the National Rehabilitation Board on behalf of persons engaged in employment which they deem to be of a rehabilitative nature. Such exemption must be sought prior to commencement of the employment.</P>
    <P>An application for exemption from the rules of behaviour was received in my Department in October 1998, over six months from the date the person commenced employment. This application was refused. A deciding officer subsequently made a revised decision disallowing entitlement to invalidity pension for days of employment during the period 23 March 1998 to 26 January 1999. The effect of this decision was to create an overpayment of £2,163.50.</P>
    <P>The person concerned appealed the decision to the social welfare appeals office and an oral hearing of his case was held on 24 November 1999. As soon as the appeals officer has assessed the evidence a determination will be made and the person will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is not aware of having permanently disrupted or destroyed any otter habitats during the course of the restoration works carried out on the Royal Canal. Pre-works ecological survey information indicated the presence of otters who probably feed on the fish in the canal and in adjacent rivers and streams but no evidence of holts was found on the canal banks. It is not envisaged that canal work will have a significant impact on the species or on their local populations.</P>
      <P>I am advised by Dúchas, that there is no reason to believe that the general otter population is declining. Otters are territorially distributed, are found throughout the country and are highly adaptable to physical changes in their environment. It is not, therefore, proposed to initiate a special conservation programme for otters.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the Juries Act, 1976 for the payment of expenses to jurors from State funds. When the Act was introduced, consideration was given to the matter of expenses but it was decided that expenses should not be paid as performance of jury service is considered to be a basic civic duty which arises relatively infrequently as far as the individual is concerned. Section 29 of the Act of 1976 does, however, make provision for employees to be paid by their employers while on jury service.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was committed to Mountjoy Prison on 8 June 1999 for driving related offences and is due for release with remission on 8 March 2000. He was transferred to Shelton Abbey on 17 June 1999. I authorised weekly renewable temporary release from Shelton Abbey for this person on 26 July 1999. Arrangements were made for him to renew his temporary release by signing on weekly in Mountjoy Prison for his convenience. However, he failed to comply with this condition of his temporary release and accordingly went unlawfully at large. The Garda was informed and he was later arrested and returned to Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I am not prepared to authorise any further temporary release for this person at this time. However, his case will be kept under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach has been to follow the practice in recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. I increased the reckonable income limits for the 1999-2000 academic year by 4.6 per cent, based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1997 to March 1998. I have also applied the increase in the reckonable income limits to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study. In such cases, for the 1999-2000 academic year, the reckonable income limits may be increased by £2,160 where there are two such children, £4,320 where there are three, and so on by increments of £2,160.</P>
      <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, I have followed the practice of recent years and increased third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, improvements in the student support schemes must have regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. I have previously indicated my intention to first seek to deal with the more significant anomalies or disincentives in the grants schemes before dealing with the more general issue of grant levels and income limits.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my priority has been to honour the commitment given in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses. I have fully honoured that commitment and introduced a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses with effect from the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also addressed the position of mature students in general and independent mature students in particular, under the student support schemes. The rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which s/he is attending. In the case of independent mature students, their normal residence is taken as their address while in attendance at college. Accordingly, a large proportion of independent mature students only qualified for the lower adjacent rate of grant.  With effect from the current academic year, all eligible mature students <Col N="1134" /> will qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant at an estimated cost of £2.4 million over the next two years.</P>
