      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Tánaiste for clarification on this. I thought the Government would have put forward substantive legislation on corruption rather than proposals of this nature. The Tánaiste will be aware that the Law Reform Commission in Britain and others have published substantive legal proposals on this issue. There is no difficulty, therefore, in terms of the availability of substantive proposals. Why is the Government not putting forward its own solid and substantive Bill instead of putting forward ideas into which it is presumably trying to get the Opposition to buy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>This referral is a technical measure, as Deputy Bruton knows. We will need changes to our legislation in this area, as we have <Col N="790" /> said in this House before. We are also dealing with the ethics in public office legislation, which will go back to the Government from the committee very shortly and will be finalised. There are, as Deputy Bruton knows, wider issues which have to be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the latest legislation on corruption in this jurisdiction was enacted in 1916 in the House of Commons in Westminster? There has been no legislation in that area since then. The burden of proof is reversed only in respect of contracts. It would be simple to amend the 1916 legislation to extend the burden of proof to other exercises of power by office holders, who if they received payments, would have to prove they were not corrupt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will have specific responsibility for this legislation? Will it be introduced by the Tánaiste's Department, which is responsible for the labour market, or will it be introduced by <Col N="792" /> the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is clearly opposed to this proposal? Could we have clarification on this promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair to say the division is on party lines. Work permit legislation is clearly a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I brought proposals to the Government which were discussed on Monday. They remain on the Government agenda and I hope we will reach a conclusion on this matter in the next couple of weeks. There are obviously other issues in regard to refugees for which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility. He is dealing with those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in a previous reply, indicated that the existing work permit legislation is being revised, simplified and modernised, and it needs to be. Can I take it the legislation which will enable asylum seekers to enter the Irish labour market is separate from the current work permit legislation? The Taoiseach appeared to inadvertently link the two in a previous reply. Are we talking about the modernisation of work permit legislation, on the one hand, and specific legislation to enable asylum seekers to enter freely into the labour market after six months, on the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the same legislation. Clearly, the current situation in regard to work permits is unsatisfactory. They are dealt with on an administrative basis under the Aliens Act, 1975, which has been updated in the most recent legislation. The procedure is administrative and legislation is required to put it on a statutory footing. The issue of asylum seekers will be dealt with in that legislation; that is the proposal currently before the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to legislation which will allow asylum seekers to work and promised legislation, I suggest the Tánaiste should assert her authority in this area and not allow herself to be suborned by the ethos of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>On related promised legislation, namely, the Bill on Bord Gáis Éireann, the Bill on gas regulation and the Bill on the Irish Energy Centre, does the Tánaiste feel a greater degree of urgency is required to deal with the structuring of the gas industry in Ireland in light of very expensive decisions which have already been made in regard to pipelines between Northern Ireland and Scotland and their implications for Ireland in terms of energy use? When will the Bills be published and will they be dealt with together given that they are so closely related? </P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the Deputy that the heads of the proposed work permits legislation are currently before the Government and the first discussion on the matter occurred at last Monday's day long Cabinet meeting. I hope that when certain matters are clarified between different Departments, we can finalise our view on this matter within the next three weeks or so.</P>
      <P>In regard to the ESRI report, I do not believe we should control inflation by increasing unemployment. I believe we can continue to generate new jobs in this economy and control inflation at the same time. That, of course, requires us to be conscious of competitiveness, taxation measures and other factors.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The proposal by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for social welfare inspectors and gardaí to take part in multi-agency vehicle checkpoints with power to stop any vehicle with suspected workers is a blatant attempt not to wipe out fraud but to harry, harass and force innocent unemployed people, according to the agenda of the Small Firms Association and others, into taking jobs with disgracefully low and slave wages which cannot be filled at present. The Minister's fire should be directed at the other end of the spectrum. I wish the Minister would listen to the debate rather than talking in the corridor, as this is the nub of the problem.</P>
      <P>This morning at an industrial estate in Park West near Ballyfermot a protest was called by building workers because a developer on the estate was insisting that the building workers in his employ should go into the black economy, that bricklayers should take £80 per day cash in hand. When the trade union members objected and when the trade union insisted on the right of workers on the site to be on the books, to pay taxes and to receive their dues, they were met with threats of intimidation, violence and death threats which have been reported to the Garda Síochána. The union officials met with pressure of the most disgraceful kind from the developer who wanted to continue to run the black economy. This concerns Harcourt Developments, a prominent development company operating in Dublin, one of the most active board members of which is Mr. Mike Murphy, an RTE broadcaster. I hope the Minister will take note of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take his hit squads off the backs of ordinary decent people and to move from an agenda of trying to frighten the innocent unemployed. Instead of stopping people in their trucks, pick-up vans and mud spattered cars, the hit squads should be sent to root out the real bully boys in the economy who can be found running the show in the construction industry. Has the Government the will or determination to do this, when traditionally the parties in Govern<Col N="798" /> ment have been financed over the years by these construction companies? IBEC and the Tánaiste are aware of the situation which has been brought to their attention. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs says he is defending taxpayers and attacks some of us who criticise his mutli-agency vehicle checkpoints. What will he do about rooting out the cowboys who are forcing workers into the black economy, who are ripping off taxpayers and who are putting the lives of building workers at risk by enforcing the conditions I have outlined? I await a reply from the Minister.</P>

        <b>:</b> I would like to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to give way to Deputy Ahern who has some serious points to make. I have no problem responding positively to what Deputy Higgins said in the sense that I too have reservations about the multi-agency checkpoints from a policing point of view. I do not think this device should be used in an indiscriminate manner as it would jeopardise the position of gardaí, particularly in disadvantaged areas, in terms of their intelligence gathering function and the respect which they have in the community. It is somewhat demeaning to involve the Garda in this kind of work. I am all for extra resources being given to the investigative arm of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in terms of rooting out fraud. However, I am not against the principle of the multi-agency checkpoints. In that regard Deputy Higgins will be disappointed to hear that I will not be voting against this measure.</P>
      <P>This measure was already implicit in the general social welfare legislation and regulations. Through the Bill the Minister has merely fully incorporated the measure into law. I understand he is doing this at the behest of the Attorney General who wanted the situation clarified. The powers have existed for a number of years in the social welfare code and it is rather sanctimonious of Deputy Higgins to scream &ldquo;shock, horror&rdquo;. The issue is whether one favours the principle of rooting out social welfare fraudsters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my speech on the Finance Bill I said it is very important that we are moving from a culture of non-compliance to compliance. This shift is occurring not just in relation to taxation, but also in relation to the obligations of ordinary citizens to respect the social welfare code and the entitlements to which they are due. In the context of tax and social welfare fraud there was a time when there was a sneaking regard among the general population for those who defrauded the taxpayer either directly through not paying their due taxes or by abusing schemes operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. We must send a clear signal to the young people <Col N="799" /> in the Gallery who will hopefully soon join the workforce that the House stands four square against all types of fraud, be it of the type described by Deputy Higgins which occurs in the business or self-employed sector or by people who do not pay their taxes. I do not believe we should water down the powers given to Revenue to pursue serious fraud. Neither do I believe the powers are draconian or too extreme. They are only right in terms of the damage being done to the Revenue collection system and, in the context of the events at Dublin Castle over the past year, the political system.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it absolutely clear that we are against fraud at every level in society, be it at the very top or the very bottom. I do not believe there should be one rule for the rich and another for the poor. The same law should apply to all. I find it remarkable that Deputy Higgins seems to be advocating a type of Robin Hood style system whereby the law of this land should not apply to people who defraud the social welfare system but should apply to those who defraud the taxation system. I find that inconsistent and wrong.</P>

      <P>If one strips away Deputy Higgins's rhetoric, at base he probably believes that and, in that sense, he should support this measure in relation to multi-agency checkpoints.</P>
      <P>My only caveat, of which I am sure the Minister will take note, is that this device should be used sparingly. It could send the wrong message to ordinary members of the Garda Síochána and may undermine their role in terms of community policing. My understanding from my research in this regard is that this power is being used sparingly and that these checkpoints are largely concentrated in the Border counties where for a number of years people have been coming down from the North to defraud our social welfare system.</P>

      <P>That is something we all deplore, as we would if people here defrauded the system. Obviously, this is a problem peculiar to our now largely irrelevant Border and it must be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill is welcome. It shows that our party in this Government is committed to looking after that section of the population who are not in work and not even low paid. The Minister has largely won his battle at the Cabinet table in pushing this caring approach, particularly in relation to the increases due to carers. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who said last night that we should consider giving more money to carers and more resources to people who want to keep their elderly relations or friends in the home rather than in nursing <Col N="800" /> homes. This is something we should review because there will be huge pressure on resources as the population profile becomes more elderly. We should encourage people to care for others in the home.</P>
    <P>We may have to consider consolidating the ministry this Minister holds into a much broader remit because it is too narrow to be focused purely and simply on social, community and family affairs. The training function is now under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and we should have a Minister with responsibility for human resources. It is a human capital which will push this country forward in terms of economic wealth creation and success. After the next election, we should consider creating a new ministry which would incorporate social welfare and the training function now resident in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and consolidating all those functions which have regard to human resources in the national economy. That would be a suitable way to harness those at work and those without work &ndash; the advantaged and the disadvantaged &ndash; for the same economic purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Conor Lenihan for sharing time with me. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this significant Bill. It gives effect to the substantial provisions announced in the budget and, in so doing, will significantly improve the quality of life for those who rely on social welfare payments, particularly the elderly and carers. Among the many innovations, the new supports for farmers and low income fishermen show that the Government values the contribution of so many people in our society. Fianna Fáil made a commitment of £100 for the old age pension in the programme for Government and the £6 increase, or 8.3 per cent, is an important step in that plan. I look forward to the other three steps in what is a five year programme.</P>
      <P>For those who care for the sick or elderly, there will be an important improvement to their quality of life with the 40 per cent increase in expenditure. The allowance is being extended by almost 3,500 people, to carers of children in respect of a domiciliary care allowance and to those, subject to a means test, caring for all people between 16 and 65 years who require full-time care and attention. The relaxation in the residency and full-time care and attention conditions are also welcome along with free telephone and travel allowance.</P>
      <P>On the travel allowance, I press the Minister to carry out a review of the facilities and ability of people in rural areas to use current public transport because that is a huge issue which will have to be addressed. In one respect, it is great to have free travel but if there is no facility or resource available on which to travel, it makes life extremely difficult for those in greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most impressive aspect as regards carers is the recognition of the need for respite. The £200 annual payment is extremely significant <Col N="801" /> and I commend the Minister on his holistic approach to the issue which, ultimately, will assist both the 11,500 carers and those cared for. It will improve the quality of life for all of them. It is also important to know that the wish to improve things further for our most needy group continues in the form of the needs assessment working group which is to be set up. I wish the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffat, well in this endeavour.</P>
    <P>Our farmers have had an extremely difficult year and their plight has been recognised and addressed on an interdepartmental level also. While the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, has introduced many measures, their plight is also dealt with in this Bill. The Minister will be remembered as the person who got rid of the pound for pound assessment, and I congratulate him in this regard.</P>
    <P>The disregard of £100 for the first two children on the family farm and the £200 for each subsequent child, as well as the fact that the farmer's net income from self-employment will be assessed at a rate of 80 per cent, should prove a real improvement for many families. I know they will be glad to hear this £10 million scheme will come into operation at the beginning of May and payments will be made at the beginning of June. However, I ask that the Minister be in a position to extend the REPS exemptions to cover people on disability allowance. I also believe the REPS exemption should cover farm assist.</P>
    <P>Another important announcement for coastal communities, such as my own, is the new fishing assist arrangements under the unemployment assistance scheme. The assessment of 80 per cent of income from self-employment, the £100 and £200 disregards as per the farm assist scheme and the relaxation of the signing-on arrangements will mean a great deal to those on low incomes who have suffered as a result of prolonged bad weather. We all know how bad the weather has been in the past few months.</P>
    <P>While the other social welfare payments are well above the rate of inflation and are most welcome, there are people in my constituency who would prefer not to have to avail of the newly increased social welfare payments. The many people who were laid off from Fruit of the Loom and the Donegal Shirt Factory continue to impress on us their wish for replacement work. I take this opportunity to reiterate their commitment to work and extol their work ethos and capability. I look forward to continued pressure being exerted on all agencies to ensure increased job creation in Inishowen and Donegal north east generally.</P>
    <P>I also look forward to the day when our unemployment statistics come down in line with national trends. I also acknowledge that a key focus of the Government is to provide training and education for the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed. We are looking to the stage when we will not have any long-term unemployed and move everyone into employment. <Col N="802" /> That is the work ethos of the people in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Time will not permit me to expand on the many other issues in the Social Welfare Bill, but I ask the Minister to seriously consider the plight of ESB meter readers who are having ongoing difficulties with their stamp recognition and the reduction in the number of readings throughout the year. I know representations will continue to be made to the Minister and I hope he will look favourably on their needs.</P>
    <P>There is much in this Bill and, suffice it to say, many people over use the words &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; and &ldquo;radical&rdquo;, but surely this is a really radical and innovative Bill. I look forward to the many Bills the Minister will introduce and wish him every success with them.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes available to me, I will make a couple of points on the Social Welfare Bill. I am pleased to support the Bill and believe most Members opposite are equally pleased to support it, if the leaflets and circulars I have seen from colleagues on the opposite side of the House in my constituency are anything to go by. These leaflets and circulars from members of Fine Gael and Labour are produced to me on a daily basis and I am asked if these are the increases. It is acknowledged by politicians outside the Chamber and on all sides of the House that this is an extremely good Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the effect of this Bill will be to produce an inclusive society and it sets about doing so in a positive and obvious manner. The job of Government and politicians is to ensure that we provide for those who cannot provide for themselves. This has been achieved by the budget improvements, particularly those in the area of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the focus of this Bill is on the elderly. We have discussed this issue at parliamentary party level throughout the year, including improvements in pensions. I am glad that those improvements have been married to increases in the income limit for eligibility for the medical card. The problem in the past was that even small increases in social welfare or pension payments caused concern among the elderly that they would lose their medical cards. I am pleased that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has substantially increased the level of eligibility for these cards. However, there has been the most unedifying spectacle of a spokesperson for the medical profession screaming that he was about to go to court to try to block this provision. I am sure the Government will not kow-tow to that kind of pressure. We have set about doing something positive for people who have given of their time, energy, sweat and blood to produce the current economic climate. It is most unedifying to see well-paid pro<Col N="803" /> fessionals screaming about going to court to block what seem minor improvements. They are major improvements if one is elderly.</P>
    <P>An indication of the success of this Bill is the fact that the only provision which has caused any opposition is that concerning multi-agency checkpoints. I have not experienced these checkpoints and I cannot make much comment on them. However, I cannot get into the lather of sweat concerning this provision. If someone is stopped and asked if they are working surely they will also be asked where they are working. This will highlight whether someone is being paid through the black economy which Deputy Higgins was screaming about. This provision will also facilitate measures against those referred to by Deputy Lenihan who cross the Border to engage in the abuses referred to by Deputy Higgins. This is a sensible step. I have not experienced the checkpoint system as it has been in operation in only one area. If one marries this measure with proposals introduced by the Minister for Finance one will see that we are tackling social welfare fraud and white collar crime. I welcome this development.</P>
    <P>Privately I have raised with the Minister the concern of women in low-paid employment regarding the amount they can earn before it affects their social welfare payments. Such women, particularly those working in the cleaning industry, are of the view that the minimum wage will not help them. Their view is that if they receive a minimum wage they will have to reduce the number of hours they work or go into the black economy. We will have to examine how this provision will affect families on social welfare. Anyone who goes to work at 4 a.m. to clean offices or supermarkets is not doing so to pay for a summer holiday in the Bahamas but to provide for their family. The Minister has increased the amount people can earn before their social welfare entitlements are affected but we need to examine this issue further.</P>
    <P>When spokesperson on social welfare in the Seanad I raised the position of payments to lone parents and I welcome any improvements in this area. We will have to draw fathers into taking responsibility for their children. I do not want this to be misinterpreted as a Thatcherite approach to child support. I am not suggesting that the Government go after absentee fathers and reduce payments to mothers. There has been recent media coverage of the fact that many children are growing up without a father and this issue has to be examined. More importantly, we cannot continue to allow young men to become fathers and then accept that the entire burden of responsibility for the child rests with the mother and her family, if they are supportive.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods introduced measures concerning attachment of earnings but I do not know the extent to which this provision is being used. I do not want a situation whereby a woman has to go to court to <Col N="804" /> obtain child support from the father. The Government and the Minister will have to address ways of making fathers more responsible for their children which are not regarded as penalties.</P>
    <P>I opposed the abolition of deserted wife's allowance by Deputy De Rossa when he was Minister. One could have changed the name of the entitlement without changing the entitlement for women whose husbands had been paying into the social welfare system and who were automatically entitled to that allowance if they could prove desertion. That is gone and it means that a woman up to 65 years of age has to present herself at the unemployment exchange to claim lone parent's allowance. If she has no dependant children she will have sign on at a labour exchange. This was not a positive development.</P>
    <P>In the context of Partnership 2000 we will also have to consider the position of those people, mainly married women, who are not eligible to sign on and are, therefore, excluded from a number of education, training and community employment schemes. There is concern that the unemployment statistics will go through the roof if this section of society is allowed sign on. However, we can be innovative enough to deal with both requirements.</P>
    <P>There has been much welcome for the £6 increase in the old age pension and people are looking forward to reaching the £100 mark promised in the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the programme for Government. This is a very deserving area and the increases have been welcomed by the elderly.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing a number of schemes to assist farmers experiencing hardship. This does not affect my constituency, but it has been pointed out that for the first time such people can see themselves earning a pound without losing a pound. The Minister should examine such an initiative aimed at women in low-paid employment who feel they will lose social welfare entitlements if they earn the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill. The fact that I have seen so many pieces of coloured literature being distributed by Members on both sides suggests that there is general acceptance and support for the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise four detailed issues concerning this Bill. I have raised some of them in the House before and some progress has been made but I wish to urge to Minister to make even further progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first issue concerns the surviving spouses of deceased old age pensioners who are entitled to secondary benefits. Where an old age pensioner is entitled to various secondary benefits and dies, the surviving spouse, if he or she is over <Col N="805" /> 60, is entitled to retain those benefits. It would cost the State very little but it would mean a great deal to surviving spouses if the age limit was abolished.</P>
    <P>Spouses, usually wives, under 60 face a difficult situation when they lose a husband who was entitled to an old age pension and secondary benefits and find that, in their mid-50s, they are only entitled to a widow's pension and lose a number of benefits they previously received. Arguments are made that she is not treated any differently from any other person of the same age who has not been widowed and who is entitled to various social benefits but does not have these secondary benefits. It is part of the human condition that what one does not have, one does not miss. However, if something one has is taken way, it can create a serious sense of grievance.</P>
    <P>There must be few cases where the surviving spouse in such circumstances is under the age of 60. It would cost very little to remove that age qualification and provide that in any case where an old age pensioner who had secondary benefits dies, the surviving spouse, irrespective of age, would continue to be entitled to those benefits.</P>
    <P>The vexed issue of the assessment of capital means in assessing eligibility for old age pensions was debated by the Minister and my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, on 2 February last. They had a long and erudite discussion on it during the course of which the Minister said, as reported in the Official Report of 2 February 1999, volume 499, column 861:</P>
    <P>Reducing the assessment rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent to the current levels of interest available on bank deposit accounts would disproportionately benefit those who are well off. Any proposals to further ease the assessment of capital would have financial implications.</P>
    <P>It appears such implications are to be avoided. The Minister also said that if the rate was reduced to a combined 1 per cent, which is the effective rate of assessment for capital means, a single person with capital of £428,000 or a married couple with capital of £856,000 would qualify for an allowance. The Minister adduces that as a reason not to change this nonsensical set of assessment rates which ignore the first £4,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said because the first £4,000 is ignored and other provisions come into play at £7,500 and £15,000 that he is not doing badly. For most people that is the case. However, the Minister also said that a total of 75 per cent of old age pensioners have no means. Only 2 per cent of old age pensioners have capital of £20,000 or over. At the end of January this year there was a total of 167,208 old age pensioners of whom 95,416 were non-contributory old age pensioners. This group is envisaged by the provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 350,000 old age pensioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am using figures I was given for the end of January. What is the number of old age non-contributory pensioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 60,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed that there were 95,000 of them. If the figure is less, it strengthens my point. If 2 per cent of those people have means of over £20,000, a maximum of 1,900 people would be affected by a change in the assessment rates. If the Minister halved the assessment rates or divided them by three and made them 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent, bringing them somewhere near the reality of the market today, only those 1,900 people would be affected. The amount of extra expenditure the Minister would incur would be minimal in return for bringing some reality to bear on the capital assessment for old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>Aside from the erudite arguments the Minister deployed on 2 February, I ask him to consider reality. He would do a better job if he said the Department in assessing the value of capital would examine the amount of income which old age pensioners get from the capital and deduct that from their entitlement. In almost every case of which I am aware, this would produce a better result for the pensioners than the artificial means used to date. The Minister may say the system has been in operation for many years. That is the case, but it has been wrong for many years. I would like a Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, of whatever stripe, to bring some reality to this matter.</P>
      <P>A couple of years ago I came across a case of three old age pensioners who were siblings and lived together in the old family home. Two of them had contributory old age pensions because they were previously employed while the third had never been employed and had a non-contributory old age pension. They found that three could live together more cheaply than three living separately. For example, they ran one car between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The member of the family with an old age non-contributory pension had been in receipt of the pension for approximately 15 years. She had savings in the bank because by living with her two siblings she was able to save money from her pen<Col N="807" /> sion. The Department of Social Welfare found out about this and said she had undeclared means. It wanted to make deductions from the pension she had been paid for the 15 previous years because she had been able to make savings from it. Unfortunately, the lady died before the matter could be resolved and it was argued between the Department of Social Welfare and her estate. It should not be beyond the ingenuity of any Minister for Social Welfare to find a way of allowing people to keep the benefit of savings from their old age pension without incurring that type of penalty.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the carer's allowance to cover carers of children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance. I am delighted that extension has been introduced and a fuller provision is being made for carers. However, the domiciliary care allowance is paid to carers of children who are over two years of age. Unhappily, some children are born with serious disabilities. Their life expectancy is short and their quality of life is not expected to be great. However, because of the current rules, the domiciliary care allowance is not paid to the parents until the children reach the age of two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister should relax the rules and make the domiciliary care allowance available to parents of all severely disabled children from birth. Many of these children do not survive long and such an action would not only be a financial ease for the parents involved, but also give them the feeling that they are not forgotten. At present they feel left out of the social welfare system. Most of them are in the position that their children require care 24 hours a day. I urge the Minister to consider extending the domiciliary care allowance scheme to cover the first two years of those children's lives.</P>
    <P>I have been in correspondence with the Department of Health and Children on this matter and I have been told for the past 18 months that the possibility of making this change is under review. It does not need to be reviewed any more. It only needs a charitable decision to be made. It would not cost much money, but it would bring a disproportionate and worthwhile benefit to the parents of these children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Social Welfare Bill. It is a Bill on which most Deputies like to comment. Each year interesting topics are raised and relevant suggestions are put to the Minister. We have this set-piece occasion once a year when the Minister brings his Bill forward. We may comment, but our points are not taken on board, nor do they get the attention they deserve. Perhaps we should engage in broader discussion of social welfare policy throughout the year, through better use of the Select Committee on Social Affairs. I hope we will have an opportunity to go into these matters in greater detail at the Social Affairs committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> I support what my colleague, Deputy Dukes, said about the means test. I take the Minister's point that previous Governments neither amended nor improved it. I cannot dispute that. However, I concur with Deputy Dukes that the present means-testing system for non-contributory old age pensions, unemployment assistance and, in a slightly amended form, for the farm assist scheme, needs to be brought closer to reality. It is difficult to reconcile the assessment of capital at 7 per cent when the return on capital is 2 or 3 per cent, but that is a debate for another day. I hope that over the next 12 months the Minister will look at that issue with a view to putting in place a more realistic means test. It is a question of give and take and of limited resources but, within the resources available to the Minister, I would like to see a realistic rather than a notional means test.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced an extra £18 million for carers this year, an increase of 40 per cent. Last year the total spent on carers was only £45 million. We can all be criticised for this because we have all been on the Government side of the House, but it shows that we have a long way to go to improve the lot of the carer. Carers have been doing unpaid work for generations, not just for their families but on behalf of the State. I hope the Minister will follow through on his commitment to improve their circumstances. I welcome what has been done this year but we have to go further because without a family carer, many of the people being cared for in their own homes would be in residential care and costing the taxpayer hundreds of pounds per week. I would make the case for giving a carer's allowance to every carer in the State. It is a minimalist demand as we approach the millennium. As this is the International Year of the Elderly, we should look after the elderly and the people who are caring for them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's ongoing commitment to bringing the old age pension rate to £100 per week. There has been an increase of £6 this year, but there is quite a distance to go. I hope the Minister will live up to his commitment in that regard also.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the free schemes to all pensioners over 75. However, we should reduce that to 70 and, eventually, to 65, particularly in the case of married couples if both are pensioners and they have nobody else living with them. Under current regulations medical evidence is necessary to show that one or other of them has a medical problem. The free schemes should be extended to all and the age limit should be reduced eventually to 65.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would detail in his reply how he intends to deal with arrears payable to people who were late in claiming contributory pensions. I welcome the progress which has been made, but public representatives have received a significant number of queries from people who believe they are owed arrears for up to five or six years. This matter should be finalised at an early <Col N="809" /> date. I am glad the arrears will be paid but we would like to see the fine print.</P>
    <P>We recognise the urgent need for the farm assist scheme. Will the Minister ensure that payment is made as early as possible? Social welfare payments can be made retrospectively but poverty is not retrospective. A significant number of farmers are enduring poverty as a result of crises in farming. The farm assist scheme will be very important to farming families. If they are to be kept on the land, payment must issue as quickly as possible. I trust that once this Bill is passed social welfare offices will be in a position to process claims and make early payment.</P>
    <P>In the context of social welfare offices, are there any further plans for decentralisation? The Department has regional offices throughout the country, and these perform an effective and efficient service. However, with so many smaller social welfare offices it should be possible, in an age of computerisation, to deal with the paperwork relating to the various allowances and schemes in the local office. Currently forms have to be sent to various places, but there are social welfare offices in the regions and schemes should be processed directly from those offices. Does the Minister intend to make progress in this area? There has been much regionalisation of Government offices. However, true decentralisation does not mean regionalisation; it means taking decisions in local offices. I would like to see progress on decentralisation of schemes to local offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing my time with Deputy Cooper-Flynn. I am delighted with the trend in this year's budget and with this Bill which seems to be redirecting money where it is needed. I particularly welcome the increases for the elderly, carers, and the new bereavement grant which are very worthy. I am delighted that the Minister and the politicians seem to have regained the ground lost to the expert groups. For too long Ministers have been quoting what was said by this or that expert group and practitioners on the ground were not listened to. I see the £5 increase last year and the £6 increase this year as a regaining of ground by the politicians, as an indication that what we are saying about who are the most deserving people is recognised in practice. The expert groups have been rowed back a little and I hope that trend continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly about the fuel allowance disregard and I am delighted with the Minister's move on it. Many people in my constituency have small private pensions and until last year they received little reward for them. They receive £15 or £20 per week from various companies and these payments prevent them from qualifying for a fuel allowance or medical card. They contributed to a pension for 40 years and received a negative response when they applied for such welfare benefits. I am also delighted with the changes relating to medical cards which have been introduced by the Minister because the door <Col N="810" /> has been opened for these people to qualify. It shows them that if they work hard and contribute to a pension, they will be rewarded.</P>
    <P>I wish that there was a greater difference between contributory and non-contributory old age pensions. Those who have contributed for 40 years receive £89 per week whereas those who did not contribute get £9 or £10 less. No Minister will reduce the non-contributory pension, but if I were Minister I would increase the contributory pension by £2 per week more than the non-contributory pension. This comes back to my basic philosophy that if one contributes for years, one must benefit.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs and Deputy Bradford is welcome to attend any meeting and impart his wisdom to us. We meet on a regular basis to discuss these issues. It is ridiculous that we only have seven or ten minutes each to debate this Bill because all Members could speak on it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that more than 200,000 people are still unemployed. I am not calling for more increases for the unemployed. The trend in the budget, which is to make it worthwhile for people to work, is the way to go. Some people talk as though the problem has been solved and that is not the case. There are many unemployed people in my constituency who are forgotten. Too many people think there is no unemployment. For example, during this morning's Order of Business Members called for asylum seekers to be allowed to work.</P>
    <P>Two reports are currently before the Cabinet which send worrying signals. One is an OECD report which was referred to by newspapers on Monday while Deloitte &amp; Touche has presented a report to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which recommends a reduction in community employment schemes. That is heresy; it is scandalous and not the way to go. It is based on the notion that the unemployment crisis has been resolved. Perhaps in well heeled areas in south Dublin there is no problem and everybody has a job. However, that is the real world.</P>
    <P>While I was delighted to preach the gospel in relation to the budget, everybody did not do famously. I have met many men, particularly those aged between 50 and 65, who will get a 3 per cent increase. However, they are unemployed and it is too expensive to retrain them. The attitude is that they will get a pension in ten years' time and it cannot be expected that they should be retrained. Community employment schemes and other forms of social work are the only options for a huge number of people. More people should be on such schemes but they should be given a greater incentive.</P>
    <P>The CES needs to be changed because it has been hijacked by lone parents. It is a scandal that single and married people get £15 extra per week on a community employment scheme while lone parents receive £80 or £90 extra per week. There is no logic to that and it is discriminatory. There <Col N="811" /> should be an equal incentive for everyone to share in community employment schemes or other forms of social work and not look for a hand out every week. I am worried about the reports which are before the Cabinet because they seem to indicate that such schemes should be cut back. To whom have the consultants spoken?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister fights hard against this. It is not exclusively under his remit as a number of Ministers are involved. The same argument applies to asylum seekers. I have nothing against them but I am inclined to think that charity begins at home. When many of my constituents, who are actively seeking employment, are looked after, I will think of others. There is a huge difference in the attitude of politicians depending on whether they are from a well heeled south Dublin constituency or a less well heeled north Dublin constituency.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have an input into the reports before Cabinet but they send the wrong signals. The rules and regulations governing community employment schemes should be changed to make them fair but the 200,000 people who are currently unemployed should be offered training or social work and if they do not take it up, they should be cut off. They need a greater incentive and I believe in &ldquo;workfare&rdquo;. Everybody receiving unemployment assistance should do one day's work and should then be offered extra money to work another day. We need to give everybody an incentive and a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Many people in my constituency have children who struggle into school at 11.30 a.m., while their mothers get up at noon. They are going nowhere and this cycle is repeated. This situation needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGennis referred to the need to examine the lone parent's scheme. Many genuine lone parents must be looked after and they should receive social welfare benefits, housing, etc.. This issue was discussed at the last meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs, with particular reference to a points system for housing. Many fathers opt out of their responsibilities and that is unacceptable. One must pay for one's fun. There is a trend, particularly in regard to local authority housing, where everyone declares themselves as lone parents. This encourages men to move to different addresses every six months. If one fathers a child, one should pay for it and I do not care whether one lives at home. The Minister must act tough about this. One can live with a certain amount of this in society but it is getting to the stage where one must cry &ldquo;halt&rdquo;. The Department must get tough.</P>
    <P>The old saying, &ldquo;any woman can get caught once&rdquo;, is fine and such women must be looked after, but 12 months notice should be given that there will be a serious examination of any new claim for a second child under the lone parent's scheme. When a woman becomes pregnant, she knows who is the father in 99 per cent of cases. <Col N="812" /> The fathers should be named and should pay for their children, whether they are drawing the dole or earning £30,000 per annum. I have come across many cases where men suddenly repaint themselves as self-employed just for a number of months. The Department thinks that they have strayed and will not take any money from them because they only receive £65 per week. That is a load of rubbish. If one fathers a child, one should pay for it whether one is unemployed or earning a good salary. A crackdown is needed. This is linked with the debate on child care. If child benefit is to be increased, which is perhaps the way to proceed, then it is time to examine the situation regarding lone parents. We cannot increase child benefit by £10 per week and expect it all to be well spent and that there will be no negative spin-off. If anything of that nature is happening, perhaps the Minister could examine carefully the current lone parent's scheme and its ramifications, and direct his money in the right direction accordingly.</P>
    <P>The lone parent's scheme is being abused. Many women in the scheme are struggling but are doing their best and will probably succeed in the end with their children turning out to be good, solid citizens. However, many of them are abusing the system wholesale. Men live with them and father their children and they should be made pay. When there is any new significant increase in child benefit, that is the time to examine the matter and grasp the nettle by correcting what has gone wrong. A small level of abuse is not significant, but it is now reaching the stage where the system needs to be carefully examined and reformed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, for sharing his time with me and welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I am delighted that £317 million in social welfare improvements were introduced in the budget. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the Bill, and also on his attitude towards social welfare. It is admittedly hard to get excited about bereavement grants and increases in some areas of social welfare, but the Minister has brought a positive approach and a bit of colour and flair to the Department, and that is welcome. It has been especially welcomed by old people and carers whom the Minister has gone a long way towards assisting in the recent budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us recognise that old people have served society well, and we would like to think they can live out their lives with dignity and not have the financial worries many of them currently have. In our programme for Government, caring for and dealing with old people was a priority for Fianna Fáil. I am delighted the Minister has honoured the commitment we gave. We are well on our way to achieving the goal of increasing the contributory old age pension to £100 over five years. We increased the pension by £5 a week last year and by £6 a week this year, bringing it to £89 <Col N="813" /> per week. I know from having spoken to elderly people in my constituency that they genuinely appreciate the Government's efforts in this area. It is an increase of 14 per cent since we took office and that is something of which we should be proud. I know my constituency colleague would agree with that because that is the view of old people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the personal increases in social welfare other than those relating to old people. Those increases of £3 per week are very significant. A number of significant changes have been made to bereavement grants. An increase from £100 to £500 is a very significant increase. Most people recognised that a £100 grant was menial and in no way assisted people in difficult financial circumstances undergoing a bereavement. I welcome the changes in that area. Many more people now qualify for the grant as a result of the easing in the qualifying criteria introduced by the Minister in the Bill. That is very significant.</P>
    <P>The commitment we gave to self-employed pensions before we came into office has been honoured fully by the Government and it is an important move. Section 21 deals with that issue where a special rate of old age contributory pension is now being given to people aged 56 or over on 6 April 1988. That is very important. A person with five years' contributions paid since that date is entitled to a special rate of contributory old age pension and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I wish to focus on three areas &ndash; carers, the farm assist programme and the fishing assist programme &ndash; because these are very important to people in my constituency. I welcome the recognition given by the Minister to carers. He has improved the lot of 11,500 people currently in receipt of the carer's allowance, and 3,500 more people will benefit as a result of changes he has introduced in the Bill. Some of the people most in need who come to me are those caring for an elderly parent or a handicapped child in the home who find it very difficult financially. In many cases, they have to give up a job to care for an elderly parent. The Minister has examined in detail the attitude to carers in society and has taken a very welcome, sensitive attitude himself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes whereby carers of children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance are now eligible for the carer's allowance. That is very important and is certainly appreciated by the people who now qualify. I also welcome the relaxation of the residency conditions for qualifying for the carer's allowance and also the relaxation of full-time care and attention rules introduced by the Minister in the Bill. I also welcome the extension of the free telephone rental scheme to people in receipt of the carer's allowance. That might seem a small matter, but it is very welcome and goes a long way towards easing the financial burden carers experience.</P>
    <P>In many cases, carers are working 24 hours a day and it is a tiring and thankless task. It is often left to one person in a family to care for an elderly parent, and any assistance the Government <Col N="814" /> can give must be offered to them. There has been considerable debate over the years about abolishing the means test for carers, but unfortunately, that is not a financial possibility at the moment, although the Minister has examined it. While we must live within our means as a country, I recognise everything is being done with the considerable finances available to assist people in need.</P>
    <P>Regarding the farm assist programme, I come from a constituency of over 5,000 farmers, many of whom have small farms and who are trying to eke out a living in very difficult circumstances. I have spoken to the Minister about the condition of farmers and unemployed people in the northern part of my constituency, Mayo. They find it very difficult to survive and most farmers would also be in receipt of social welfare payments. Not only do people live on very small farms in that part of the world, they are also the worst hit by the weather. The Minister recognised, as I do, the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, under the fodder scheme. While that is helpful, 75 per cent of farmers in my county have no fodder and are in dire straits, and the other 25 per cent are in severe difficulty. It is a difficult time for farmers but I know that is recognised by the Minister. I welcome the changes he has introduced in section 16 whereby a farmer will now be assessed at a rate of 18 per cent of his self-employment income, including farming, instead of the pound for pound basis which applied before. I also recognise the concessions he has introduced relating to children in families, which will go some way towards assisting those farmers in serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Keaveney, said earlier that, while the improvements in social welfare are very welcome, most of us would prefer if our constituents did not have to rely on those benefits, and I agree with that. There have been two factory closures in my county recently: Betatherm in Ballinrobe with the loss of 40 jobs and the Allfresh bakery in Charlestown with the loss of 100 jobs. While I know the Government is making every effort to ensure replacement jobs are found, those people are now living in a community which has lost a massive income as a result of the closure of the factories. While I welcome the increases in social welfare benefits, I hope the Government will make every effort to find replacement jobs.</P>
    <P>The European initiative towards reducing unemployment in member states, to which we are party, means we are going to do everything we can over the coming years to ensure every young person is either put in a job or given a training scheme to ensure they have self-esteem and the right attitude to work in the years ahead. I know it is one of the Minister's aims in coming years to reduce the dole queue, and it is an aim with which we all agree and would like to see achieved. I also welcome the fishing assist programme. I come from a county with not only a huge rural population but also a huge fishing one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> I fully support the Bill and welcome the fact the Minister has brought it before the House. I concur with the views of my colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, about CE schemes. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

I am totally opposed to the proposal relating to social welfare officers, Customs officers and gardaí. It is outrageous. It is an attack on the poor. If the Minister wants to attack anybody, he should attack the rich, but he should leave the poor alone. In north Mayo &ndash; my constituency colleague will confirm this &ndash; many rural Garda stations have been closed. Perhaps social welfare officers could double up and do both jobs, given the shortage of gardaí. The people of the area have been plagued in recent years. They have suffered because of the weather and the land is of poor quality. I cannot understand why the attack has been focused on the area. I hope my colleagues in Fianna Fáil will raise the issue at meetings of the parliamentary party and block this ridiculous proposal.</P>
      <P>I disagree also with my constituency colleague on the position of carers for whom successive Governments have done nothing. If a person on social welfare decides to care full time for his or her mother, father, grandmother or grandfather or a sick relative, he or she will receive a few pounds more per week. A person in full-time employment, however, would not be able to live on the carer's allowance for which many do not qualify because their husband or wife is working and on a good income. The first £50 should not be means tested.</P>
      <P>The work of carers is not recognised. In other countries there is great respect for the elderly. We are beginning to lose that respect. I compliment those who look after an elderly relative at home, be they a brother, sister, mother or father. The alternative is to place them in a home but at what cost to the State? The work of carers, particularly those over the income threshold, should have been recognised in the budget. This should be rectified as soon as possible. Most people would like to be looked after and to die at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will not allow rent payments to local authorities to be made direct under the household budget scheme. Social welfare recipients, regardless of the benefit, should be permitted to enter into an agreement with the local authority to have rent payments deducted at source. I do not understand why this cannot be done. It is always the woman &ndash; never the man <Col N="816" />&ndash; who has to make sure payments are made to the local authority to ensure they have a roof over their heads. I hope an amendment to this effect will be tabled by my party on Committee Stage. There would be no cost. There appears to be a new policy in County Mayo in recent months. The county council appears to spend every day in court prosecuting tenants. It has tried to put some out of their homes. This is outrageous. The request I am making is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Farmers in the west have had a difficult time in the past 18 months. Despite this health boards and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have not adjusted the rates at which they assess cattle, sheep and other stock. The Minister may consider this in the small farmers scheme which will be introduced before the local elections. The increases in child benefit should also be paid before the local elections, instead of September. Increases in social welfare will be paid from June.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the Celtic tiger and about how well the economy is performing. The elderly receive the £5 fuel allowance from October to April. It should be paid throughout the year at a cost of between £3 million and £4 million. One has to light a fire 52 weeks of the year. This would make a huge difference to the old and the sick. It is the least that should be done for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, should ask local authorities to increase their income guidelines in respect of local authority housing. Two pounds of the £3 increase in social welfare will go to local authorities. What is being given with one hand is being taken with the other. There should be a decent increase in the income guidelines. This would enable social welfare recipients to retain the entire increase in their payments.</P>
    <P>On the death of a spouse, widows and widowers not of pension age lose their entitlements under the free schemes. The Minister should consider allowing them to retain their benefits for six months at least. It is an awful shock. First, they lose their partner and then they lose all the free schemes. It is a major loss. If the Minister will not allow retention on a full-time basis, he might at least allow it to them for six months.</P>

        <b>:</b> I do not intend to spend all my time either burying or praising the Minister. I just want to make a few suggestions and compliment him on the good he has done. His is a difficult role. No matter what provisions a Minister introduces, there will always be those who say he should have gone a little further. However, we are living at a time of economic boom and Government backbenchers who make comparisons between current payments and payments when other people were in Government are not being fair. We are living in a different era and the least we can do is look after the least well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> I want to refer to two matters which were referred to the Minister's office. I am aware that often the Minister does not receive such correspondence. Tinteán, the voluntary housing group in Carlow, wrote to the Minister on 11 January regarding the rent supplement and the pension increase. It made a valid point. The Minister gives £6 per week to old age pensioners but if they are in rented accommodation, their rent allowance which they receive from through the health board is cut by £2. It is unfair. Tinteán's letter stated:</P>
    <P>To give a comparison, . A farmer who retires on reaching pension age transfers his holding to one of his family, retaining the normal rights of residence and maintenance. He will enjoy the full Old Age Pension and will receive in full the increase under the '98 &amp; '99 budgets.</P>
    <P>A casual farm worker who retires and has to rely on the Commercial Sector or Voluntary Housing to provide, on a rental basis, a place to live may need to apply for Rent Supplement to meet his tenancy obligations. This pensioner does not enjoy the full benefits of the '98 &amp; '99 budgets, but by virtue of the clawbacks is reduced to the same level of increase as all the other Social Welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that there is this distinction between pensioners. Being an efficient group, Tinteán made a suggestion. Its letter states that one suggestion might be &ldquo;to change the baseline assessment criteria in respect of Rent Supplement entitlement for our senior citizens only to an appropriate pension rate . .&rdquo; If that line was taken, it would mean everybody would retain their pension increase rather than have it reduced through a clawback. Having drawn the attention of the Minister to this matter, if he has not come across it already in his office, I hope he might deal with it.</P>
    <P>There is another piece of correspondence to which I want to refer. In this case the Minister's office reference number is 986775. This man wrote to the Minister in early December. When he wrote to me on 6 February he said that he had not received a reply and if he got one in the meantime he would contact me. I presume he has still not received a reply. He is concerned about the self-employed, some of whom were caught between the ages of 63 and 66. They paid their contributions but are not entitled to widow's or widower's <i>pro rata</i> pension to which he feels they should be entitled. If he wrote to the Minister in December, he should have received an answer before he wrote to us. He makes the point that while there was a 53 per cent refund given to people who did not qualify, 47 per cent was retained. He wants to know what happened that 47 per cent and why it was kept in the fund if a person would not benefit.</P>
    <P>Year after year my colleagues and I have spoken on behalf of widows. No matter what we do we cannot undo their trauma. If they are depending on social welfare, it is important that <Col N="818" /> we treat them as a different class because they are doing such an onerous job. I hate to see widows getting the same increase as other people. They must run a house, heat it and do all the things which would be done if their spouse was with them. We should make an exception of widows. We should give them a different category of allowance in order to help them get through their difficult chore. There is no point in going into the psychological and other disadvantages which they might encounter on occasions and their difficulty in rearing children on their own. They have a greater cost base which we should look after.</P>
    <P>We are all against the black economy. How to deal with it is a difficulty for any Minister or Government. I heard people criticise the on-going vehicle checks. If they are abused, that cannot be tolerated. On the other hand the Minister stated that the occupants of 10 per cent of the vehicles at one checkpoint were found to be involved in fraudulent work. That is a high rate of detection. It is not easy to judge whether that rate was exceptional. I do not want to be hypocritical, saying that the black economy should be stamped out and at the same time telling the Minister not to impose checks, but it sounds as if a sledgehammer is being used. Perhaps it has proved effective and justifiable. It was stated that £350,000 was saved in a short space of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> We can argue whether or not it is disallowed. People may be discouraged from signing on simply because there is pressure. We cannot defend people who abuse the system. On the other hand we cannot abuse them. If we were paying out less to people who did not deserve it, we could pay more to those dependent on social welfare. It is as simple as that. If people are abusing the system and working while in receipt of unemployment payments, it is unjust.</P>
      <P>When we were in Government I would have defended the line that these people should be found out. I will not change my position at this stage but if there is any abuse of this vehicle checkpoint, if people are held up and there is no return, they should be stopped. On the other hand we cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>I would welcome the inclusion of the farmers in the FIS scheme. Even if there is a question about their returns, if farmers were receiving FIS there would be a greater incentive for them to work. The unemployment assistance they receive, farmers' dole, is degrading because that scheme does not encourage them to work. It might be easy to administer but it is the wrong scheme.</P>
      <P>I welcome the improvements in the carer's allowance. We often discussed it here when Deputy Woods was Minister for Social Welfare and things were much worse. The free telephone rental scheme is a good idea also and I appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> The Minister deserves credit for dealing with the death grant. It was embarrassing when people contacted us about the death grant to discover it was only £100. I congratulate the Minister for increasing it to £500. I do not know why I have praised him so much.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Social Welfare Bill is evidence of the Government's commitment to ensuring Ireland becomes a State in which nobody is left out. This social welfare package is the best ever granted by any Government and includes a welcome provision for low income farmers. Because of the economic growth over the past ten years it is now possible to invest in the future; that includes the future of those receiving all types of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>There are particular aspects of the Bill on which I want to compliment the Minister. The extension of the carer's allowance to carers of people between the ages of 16 and 65 who require full time care and attention is a major improvement in the scheme. The extension of the free travel and free telephone rental allowance for carers is also a beneficial feature for those engaged in this important work and for those in care. The relaxation in the residency and full-time care conditions is another important factor. This will ensure people who care for a neighbour or relative who lives next door will be able to apply for the allowance.</P>
      <P>Carers provide an important service in the community. People in need of care can live and be cared for in their communities. The move to unfamiliar surroundings, such as a hospital or nursing home, may become unnecessary for many older people.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a package of measures designed to improve the position of older people in our society. These are the people who contributed greatly to our economy at a time when working conditions were much more difficult. A couple in receipt of an old age pension will benefit by £9 per week and will be £15.50 better off since this Government came into office. The weekly payment to a couple, both aged 66, in receipt of old age contributory pensions will increase to £148.90.</P>
      <P>I welcome the commitment to the introduction of a <i>pro rata </i>pension for the self-employed who were aged 56 years or over when social insurance was extended to the self-employed. Older people will also benefit from an increase in tax allowance and from an extension of the guidelines used to establish medical card eligibility for persons over the age of 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major increase in the disabled person's and essential repairs grants available through local authorities will help older people to improve the standard of their living accommodation. The new bereavement grant of £500 for self-employed <Col N="820" /> people is welcome because it will help alleviate the cost of funeral expenses.</P>
    <P>The Minister is acknowledging in the Bill the difficulties being experienced by many low income families. The new farm assist scheme will target income at those farmers in genuine need. This is a vital requirement for the survival of many rural farm families, and the Minister must be complimented on that. I was involved in that scheme through the National Farmers' Association when we visited Northern Ireland some time ago to see how a similar scheme operated there.</P>
    <P>All families will benefit from an increase in child benefit and an increase in the family income supplement threshold. The Bill illustrates the Government's commitment to people dependent on our social welfare system for income support. I welcome the Bill and compliment Minister Ahern on the work he is doing for needy people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister. This is the second Social Welfare Bill he has introduced since taking up office, and there are substantial improvements in it for older people, families and communities. I particularly welcome the £6 increase for old age pensioners; we are moving quickly towards a pension of £100 per week in the year 2002.</P>
      <P>I welcome the £18 million package of improvements for carers which will implement most of the recommendations in the carers review. The Minister knows that I would like the means test for the carer's allowance abolished, although I realise that would cost more than £140 million. I ask the Minister and his Department to examine the question of the level of care because, in the case of the nursing home subvention, for example, three types of payment are made &ndash; £75, £90 and £120.</P>
      <P>We are not talking only about the elderly. There is the question of caring for people, including young people, with a disability who incur extra expenses as a result of the need for physiotherapy and other services. I know of families in County Galway who have to travel with young disabled people to Dublin for those services. It is important that the level of care is examined and there is a precedent in terms of the nursing home subvention.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister that the carer does not have to live in the home of the person needing care. That is important and I hope the measure will be implemented. I also welcome the Minister's statement that an additional 3,500 people will now qualify for the carer's allowance for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> The Minister mentioned that other Departments are involved in the care of the elderly. That is an important point in terms of elderly people who need housing aid or home improvements carried out. Schemes are available for this through the health boards which are very useful because they give elderly people security, even if it is only a question of putting in new windows and doors. Such measures are important for their health and independence because many elderly people like to stay at home. It should be a priority for the Government to have such home improvements carried out. One thousand people have applied to the Western Health Board for house improvements. That is an area at which more funding will have to be directed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the farm assist scheme, which will come into effect from April 1999, under which 13,400 low income farmers will benefit. An additional £10 million is being allocated to the scheme, making a total of £43 million for low income farmers in a full year. In the past, when farmers gained a pound, they lost a pound, but this will not happen with the new means test. There is also an easing of the means test for fishermen, similar to the farm assist scheme.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension of <i>pro rata </i>pensions for the self-employed over the age of 56 who have at least five years' paid contributions. This will benefit hundreds of people who were told in the past that they did not have a sufficient number of contributions. Widows and widowers also lost out in the past, and I am not talking only about farmers. Shopkeepers, small building contractors and business people will benefit under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced a significant increase in the bereavement grant scheme which will be increased to £500 from April. That is important because health boards have experienced difficulty in assisting people with funeral expenses. In cases where the deceased person has no relatives it is difficult to obtain payment and I suppose there has been duplication between the health boards and the Department because they are both involved in these schemes. I have much sympathy for carers, who in the past might have earned as little as £1 per hour from health boards for home help work, whose funeral expenses were not paid in full by the Department.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues spoke about the move to bring forward payment dates. I understand the Minister has referred in the past to the possibility of bringing payment dates back to April to coincide with the start of the tax year. I would welcome that. Ideally, we would like to see social welfare increases implemented in January. The introduction of social welfare increases in January 2000 would be an appropriate celebration of the millennium. Perhaps Deputy Séamus Brennan, the Minister of State with responsibility <Col N="822" /> for millennium celebrations, might act on this suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has been innovative in introducing schemes such as the back to work scheme, back to education schemes, training support schemes and the student summer jobs scheme which I have referred to in the past. The student summer jobs scheme is very useful and I look forward to its continuing this summer. Complaints have been made about the severity of the means test for this scheme. The Minister might consider the difficulties faced by families in which two or more children are in third level education. The means test could be relaxed in such cases. There are many sponsors who are looking for students to employ and the scheme is of great benefit to students who take part in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has often said he wishes to encourage people to join the workforce and to reduce the number of people who are unemployed. There are many schemes to help people to do this. I know of people who, on their own initiative, have become transport managers, for example. These people are required to get a certificate of competency. They should be given some help, either by the Minister's Department or through community employment schemes, in doing this and in giving employment. A similar situation exists with regard to community employment schemes. Participants on these schemes are required to be in receipt of unemployment assistance or other social welfare benefit. Married women, in particular, are discriminated against by these requirements. We must look at ways of helping people to get employment when they fail to qualify for social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. The Minister has made major improvements in addition to the increases in social welfare payments and to the improvements he made in the Social Welfare Bill of 1998. I hope he will be given the funding to bring about the increase in the carer's allowance and the other improvements we seek.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and on making very important and progressive changes in the social welfare code. Since taking office, the Minister has demonstrated a keen desire to take care of the sections of society which need care and has adopted a very imaginative approach to dealing with the issues we face. I thank him for the increases in social welfare payments generally and particularly in the assistance schemes, child benefit schemes and in family income supplement which was much discussed earlier this year. The Minister has taken a keen interest in the carer's allowance. The improvements in this scheme are very worthwhile and will ensure that many people can be cared for in their own homes rather than go to insti<Col N="823" /> tutions. We have been campaigning for quite some time for an increase in the subvention for nursing home care. This may be for another Minister but it is a serious matter and there is widespread criticism of the level of subvention. Urgent action must be taken in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made some allowances for development workers coming back to Ireland. This is very worthwhile. Many development workers find it difficult to get employment here and very difficult to settle into jobs. The improvements in this regard are very welcome.</P>
      <P>I have some concerns about section 26 which deals with the appointment of inspectors and the granting of powers to these inspectors to visit premises, examine records and so on. I am not convinced that much work has been done in this area in the past few years. Most social welfare inspectors have been busily engaged in assessments of means and investigations of claims of one sort and another. Inspecting the records of employers is much more important than stopping people in cars on their way to and from work. I have reservations about the practice of social welfare officers being involved in examining records with gardaí at checkpoints. It would be far more helpful to appoint additional personnel to enter places of employment to ensure that records and payments are kept up to date. We all know of occasions when companies closed down, owing huge amount of money to the social welfare fund. The Minister might give us some indication of the number of premises which have been inspected and of the work being done in this regard.</P>
      <P>I refer to the disregard of certain income of people who are in receipt of benefits. I am concerned that gross income seems to be taken as equal to weekly earnings. Gross income is often very different from take home pay. While I welcome the increase in the levels of disregarded income, some allowance should be made for travelling expenses, taxation and items of that nature.</P>
      <P>Section 31 limits payments. I have read many Bills in the past and I would be greatly relieved if someone could read this section and translate it into meaningful language. Anyone trying to read this section will be totally confused and perhaps in need of the help of a psychiatrist. The most important thing to say in this regard is that we do not wish to see people less well off as a result of these provisions.</P>
      <P>It has come to my notice that because farm retirement pensions have been calculated in ecus, many people in receipt of these pensions find them reduced by approximately 5 per cent when they are paid in pounds. Some mechanism should be found to compensate people for this loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency and especially in the west of County Clare, many elderly people live alone in isolated conditions. In many cases their hous<Col N="824" /> ing and the access to their homes is in a very bad state. I appeal to the Minister to discuss this matter with his colleagues, particularly with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to see if a fund could be established to provide proper access to the homes of elderly people living alone in isolated areas. When the Minister reviews the carer's allowance he might examine the possibility of introducing a childminder's relative allowance, which would ensure many infants and children of pre-school age could be cared for in their homes by relatives.</P>

      <P>I stated here that we must revisit the issue of the carer's allowance following the introduction of the budget, and I intend to do that. I also wish the Minister to examine other aspects of social welfare. The issue of the pre-1953 contributions is contentious. It concerns a small group who made contributions prior to 1953 which did not entitle them to participate in a full pension. As there are very few of those people left, will the Minister examine the possibility of remedying this position? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Minister.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of the living alone allowance and the allowance for people over 80 years of age. A requirement of the living alone allowance is that an applicant must be in receipt of an Irish pension. I am aware of people who were born and reared here and had to go to England to work in tough times when they could not get work here. They have returned and are in receipt of a pension but they have limited means. Many of those people are over 80 years of age, living alone and are not entitled to a living alone allowance. An elderly Irish person living alone, who is not in receipt of an Irish pension, should at least be entitled to such an allowance. I ask the Minister to review this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister give a commitment to old age contributory and non-contributory pensioners that the Government will tie the level of pensions to the level of the average industrial earnings? The Senior Citizens' Parliament of Ireland made a submission on this. The Labour Party's position on it is that initially the standard should be set at 34 per cent of industrial earnings. It is necessary <Col N="825" /> to relate contributory and non-contributory pensions to average industrial earnings to ensure pensioners participate in the growth of our economy. Many of these people made sacrifices through the years to build this economy to the level it is at today and now they are finding it difficult to make ends meet. Many other groups have passed them out in financial terms.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the issue of the restrictions that apply to when the holders of free travel passes in Dublin, Cork and Limerick can travel on buses and trains. Many elderly people living in the inner-city have to travel by bus to Tallaght Hospital for early morning appointments when they may not use their free travel passes. This also applies to many of my constituents who have to travel by bus to Beaumont Hospital for early morning appointments. I would like the Minister to review the time restrictions that apply to the use of free travel passes.</P>
    <P>We have allowed an <i>ad hoc </i>support system for carers to develop, which has not been given the priority it deserves in terms of funding. Notwithstanding the hype and media headlines following the announcement of the budget about the increase in the carer's allowance, we could critically examine what improvements it has made. Given that our recent strong economic performance has yielded significant Exchequer returns, a substantial increase in the carer's allowance should have been given as well as a commitment to improve the area of community care. This would entail the provision of more professional health workers and other improvements targeted at carers. Carers have often given up paid employment or the potential to participate in it to care for members of their families in their homes. Many daughters and, indeed, sons have given up the prospect of marriage to care for a loved one. A non-means tested cost of care allowance should be introduced to cover the hidden cost of caring, including the cost of heating, laundry, special dietary requirements and so on.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about what has been achieved for carers. In a contribution prior to the budget I said I would monitor the position of carers and ensure the Minister honoured his commitment to them. A document published by the Carer's Association states that last year's budget was one of the all time disappointments for carers in the home. Some 11,500 carers are in receipt of the carer's allowance. Under the Minister's proposal an additional 3,300 carers will be brought into the scheme, but that will account for only one in four carers. The £3 per week increase in the carer's allowance for carers under the age of 66 is inadequate. Given our economic performance, it should have been possible to give a substantial increase in the allowance. Notwithstanding the hype about the carer's allowance and the information circulated by the Minister to sell the budget and the Social Welfare Bill, carers who <Col N="826" /> are providing a service that saves the State millions of pounds describe the increase in the carer's allowance as a major disappointment. While I would like to elaborate on this, I will yield to Deputy McCormack.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with some of the anomalies in the social welfare code which we encounter in our constituency work as public representatives. The praise is already on the record and I will not waste time by adding to it.</P>
      <P>Most speakers referred to the carer's allowance, which is a pet subject of mine. I consider the carer's allowance to be one of the greatest and most compassionate social welfare schemes but there are some anomalies which I have been endeavouring for the past year and a half to have corrected. So far I have met a stone wall. I was told that a review group was sitting which would deal with it. I made a submission to the review group and I have on file several letters to the Minister and several notes of when I raised this matter in the Dáil. I will continue to raise it until I get some satisfaction.</P>
      <P>For example, a woman &ndash; carers are generally women &ndash; minding a bedridden, incontinent relative of her husband qualifies for the carer's allowance because her husband's income is under £150 per week, or under £162 if they have one, two or three children. If her husband dies in any circumstances, she then qualifies for the widow's pension. She will receive a widow's pension of £72 to compensate her for the loss of her husband who was earning an income of up to £150 per week. She will then immediately lose the carer's allowance because the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs cannot make double payments. I have asked for this glaring anomaly to be corrected but I have met a blank wall. I appeal again to the Minister, as I did in my contribution on the budget and on last year's Social Welfare Bill, to amend provision.</P>
      <P>Another anomaly concerns a carer living in a local authority house. If that person qualifies for the carer's allowance the local authority immediately takes back 20 per cent or £18; in other words, the local authority steals £18 of the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>The third anomaly is that the carer is taxed when the carer's allowance is added to the husband's income. That anomaly should be eliminated because it is not fair to tax the carer on the carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final point was drawn to my attention as a result of recent burglaries of old people's houses in Galway and other areas where considerable sums of money were found. I ask the Minister to examine the qualifications for social welfare. Elderly people with savings over £2,000 are currently estimated to have an income of 8 per cent from those savings, when in actual fact they only have an income of less than 1 per cent from them. <Col N="827" /> As a result, people are reluctant to put their savings in banks and other financial institutions because they are being penalised by the social welfare system for so doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the buoyant nature of our economy, why has child benefit been increased by such a small amount? Parents have to pay many expenses, such as crèche charges, and the Government is doing nothing about it.</P>
      <P>There has been a substantial reaction against the Minister's proposal in the legislation to stop people on their way to and from work to inquire where they are going. That is a gross infringement of people's rights. I am not happy with the explanation provided by the Minister or by the Department officials who were sent out to announce and sell this on &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a point raised by the previous speaker. I know a person minding her 94 year old mother-in-law who has lost all her allowances, including the living alone allowance, for which she was eligible. As the carer's son is earning £20,000 a year she is entitled to nothing, although she is rearing a family of four or five children in addition. If that person were in a home it would cost the State between £400 and £500 per week. I ask the Minister to look at such cases. It is unfair that we do not have a system in 1999 that can cater for people who are saving the State substantial amounts of money.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposal for farmers in financial difficulties, it seems they will have to qualify for the leaving certificate before they are eligible for any of the money. They will be approved in May and the money might be backdated to April, but people are starving in many parts of the country. I am not surprised it has taken so long to bring forward proposals in this area, given the Minister's attitude to this when we tabled a motion last October or November.</P>
      <P>The poorest person in this country is a pensioner who lives alone and who still has to pay rent to the local authority. Such people are finding it extremely difficult to live and are doing without food.</P>
      <P>Subvention payments have not been increased since they were introduced in 1993 while nursing home charges have increased substantially. Something should be done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips should get together and try to have longer Second Stage debates on important legislation such as the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill. All Members of the House should look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Government should take a policy decision to move towards reducing the qualifying age for an old age pension from its current level of 66 years to 60 years of age. The <Col N="828" /> qualifying age had been 70 years from the foundation of the State. Richie Ryan, then Minister for Finance, and Frank Cluskey, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, set out to reduce it from 70 years to 66 years &ndash; it had been intended to reduce it to 65 years but the Government changed. We should, as a country, make a firm decision to reduce the qualifying age for the old age pension to 60 years of age. That would benefit those aged 60 years and over as they could draw a pension and it would create employment for those entering the labour market.</P>
    <P>The farm assist scheme will be means tested. The existing situation in regard to the payment of unemployment assistance to farmers is unsatisfactory. I recently met a person whose cattle are on the verge of starvation and he is not too far from that himself. He applied for unemployment assistance on a number of occasions but has not qualified for it. This man, who is a bachelor, is in a serious situation. He will also be excluded from the scheme the Minister is introducing, although he is barely able to survive. I am somewhat unhappy with this scheme &ndash; it would have been much fairer and better to have used the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals in regard to the bereavement grant of £500. While I had hoped for greater increases in children's allowance, the Minister has gone a good distance. I also welcome the carer's allowance. I believe that the powers which have been given to the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are totally wrong. George Orwell would not even have thought of them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies O'Keeffe and Broughan complained about what they perceived to be the small size of this package. That is absolute nonsense. The overall cost of these improvements will be in the region of £320 million by the end of Committee Stage on a full year basis and £192 million for the remainder of 1999. This is the biggest social welfare package in the history of the State and substantially exceeds the increases provided by the Deputies' parties when they were in Government. For example, the first year cost of the improvements I am introducing is now almost £103 million or 49 per cent higher than the full year costs of the last budget package introduced by the Rainbow Coalition in 1997. The costs of these improvements for 1999 is more than £78 million or 69 per cent higher than the equivalent budget year costs of the Rainbow Coalition's last budget. The allocation of this substantial level of <Col N="829" /> additional resources clearly demonstrates the priority this Government is giving to the issues of exclusion, marginalisation and poverty.</P>
    <P>I understand the Opposition may vote against this Bill. It is important to emphasise that anyone who votes against it is voting against the major improvements outlined in it.</P>

They still have not corrected the record in regard to that false information.</P>

      <P>Since budget day, I have secured Government approval for further improvements which have not been acknowledged by some of the speakers on the other side of the House. <Col N="830" /> These include the provision of an extra £5 million in 1999 to bring forward payments on the farm assist scheme to the beginning of April, the introduction of measures to improve the position of low income fishermen costing £1 million in a full year and £0.5 million in 1999, a new bereavement grant costing £10 million and additional enhancements in the pension improvements for self-employed people over 56 years of age. I am also extending the back to work allowance scheme to carers, thus representing a further improvement to their situation since budget day.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers, Deputy O'Keeffe among them, raised the issue of the breakdown of the cost of measures I am introducing. Of the total 1999 costs of £192 million, approximately £97 million or 50 per cent is fully Exchequer funded with the £95 million balance being funded from PRSI contribution income. However, the question of the breakdown of the budget package between Exchequer and PRSI funded costs is of little relevance to those who depend on social welfare payments. What is of primary concern to them is the level of increases actually provided and, in this regard, the increases this Government has provided are well ahead of the increases provided by the Rainbow Coalition. For example, the old age non-contributory pension was only increased by £6.50 over the previous Government's three budgets. To date, in this Government's two budgets, the old age non-contributory pension has been increased by £11, almost double the amount provided by the Rainbow Coalition over three budgets. It is also worth comparing the miserly £1.50 increase provided to old age non-contributory pensioners and the £2.40 increase to pension couples in 1995 with the £6 increase to old age non-contributory pensioners and the £9 to pension couples this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not like to hear the truth. In 1993, the real increase provided by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government amounted to £2. The real increase provided in 1994 was only 60p. In 1995, there was no real increase; inflation stood at 2.5 per cent and the then Government gave a 2.5 per cent increase. In this budget, we are giving a 2.3 per cent increase on normal payments and old age pensioners are receiving a real increase of 5.1 per cent.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers have raised the issue of the assessment of capital. It is important to emphasise that the effective assessment rate is much lower than 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent. Opposition Deputies are aware of that but are attempting to misconstrue the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister not change the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a significant capital disregard of £2,000 before an assessment is made <Col N="831" /> and there are a number of other aspects of the means test which, on interacting with the assessment formula, operate to reduce it even further. For instance, in the case of old age and widowed pensioners, the first £6 of weekly assessable means does not affect entitlement to payment and, in the case of a couple, means are taken to be half the joint means. All of this combines to make the effective rate much lower than the 7.5 per cent or 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>That fact was acknowledged by Deputy De Rossa when he introduced these measures in the previous Government in April 1997. He stated that in relation to the changes in assessment, the effective rate for couples with £20,000 would be just 3 per cent compared with the 5 per cent which then pertained. Deputy Durkan, a Minister of State at the time, claimed that the new capital assessment changes were much more generous than they had previously been. I agreed before today to review the current operation of capital assessment given that some people are spinning the wrong story and trying to give old age pensioners the impression that the State is, in some way, taking money out of their pockets. That is not true.</P>

      <P>These checkpoints were highlighted in the media as far back as last April. It is somewhat ironic that people are criticising them. The <i>Evening Herald</i> of 24 April 1998 contained a complete rundown of exactly what was taking place in relation to the checkpoints and on 9 May 1998 the <i>Irish Independent</i> had a major article on them. In May 1998 my local paper included a headline which read &ldquo;Many hauliers are bagged in the net&rdquo;. The scheme was well publicised and for anybody to say they did not know what was going on is an indication that they are not paying attention to what is happening. I know that Deputy Higgins may not have the necessary backup, but I thought some of the Opposition parties would have checked the papers.</P>
      <P>I commend the Garda on the initiative. Often people are not compliant on a number of fronts and a multi-agency approach to fraud is a most efficient way of using State resources. There are two new powers in the Bill, namely, the power to remove and secure documents for later inspection and the power to require an employer to make himself or some other competent person available to answer questions which an inspector may wish to ask.</P>

      <P>These powers have become necessary in the light of shortcomings in the existing powers identified by inspectors. Deputy O'Keeffe was concerned that the powers would be exercised in a random manner and that people's rights of privacy and confidentiality might be breached. This shows a distinct and surprising mistrust of the agencies involved on the part of the Deputy. Multi-agency checkpoints by their very nature are very carefully planned. There is no question of any person's privacy being compromised and a person may seek to answer questions in private. In order to ensure delays are kept to a minimum, interviews are kept as short as possible, with more detailed inquiries being conducted in the aftermath of an operation.</P>
      <P>Both I and my Department have received anecdotal evidence that quite a number of people are signing off the live register as a result of the publicity engendered by the checkpoints. I thank some Deputies in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is important for Deputy Higgins to be aware of a further fallout in relation to this checkpoint as following employer inspections 15 cases were referred to the social security agency in Northern Ireland. In two cases live claims were already being made in the North. Therefore, we are catching people who are coming across the Border, something we have all wanted to do in recent years. I could go through the entire list which shows fraud rates of 8.5 per cent, 8.7 per cent and 3 per cent. In the north east, <Col N="834" /> my own area, 300 vehicles were checked over a four day period resulting in 25 fraudulent claims being detected, a fraud rate of 8.3 per cent. The result was a saving of £66,000 to the taxpayer. This checkpoint had a particularly high profile locally and was reported in both the local and national newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the fourth quarter of 1998 the CSO included a module on crime and victimisation in the quarterly national household survey, in addition to the regular questions on the population and labour force. The module included over 50 questions and I will forward a full copy of these to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The main topics covered included the incidence, type, location and other relevant aspects of crime in the past year; whether or not crimes were reported to the Garda Síochána; household security and people's perceptions of crime and safety.</P>
      <P>The relevant information was collected in the three month period from September to November 1998 and it is hoped that results will be available in the middle of this year.</P>

        <b>:</b> I welcome the Minister of State's reply. This is a positive measure which will provide a valuable comparison and cross-reference with the official statistics. The questions asked in the survey seem comprehensive but will the Minister of State outline whether there was consultation with the Garda Síochána or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform when drafting the questions?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his welcome. He was perhaps the first to suggest the inclusion of such questions in the survey and it is now being dealt with. The questions were framed in consultation with an expert advisory group on which the Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach, the ESRI, Trinity College, the North-Eastern Health Board and the National Council on Ageing and Older People <Col N="837" /> were represented. There was a wide consultation process.</P>
      <P>Over 50 questions were asked and I will be fascinated to see the answers which are due shortly. They solicited a broad range of people's perceptions on crime and the types of crime and such qualitative information which will be very useful. It will be interesting to see how the results compare with the official figures.</P>

        <b>:</b> Do the questions relate to people's personal experiences of crime or to general crime in the area? Will this be a feature of the quarterly household survey henceforth?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extensive survey and there are no plans to repeat it every quarter. However, we will have to repeat it at some stage but I am not sure when that will be. We will see how this turns out and how the results compare with the official figures. I cannot see us not repeating the exercise at an appropriate time. We will consider when that will be when we see the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The questions are largely personal. They ask people if they have had their vehicles stolen; whether the vehicles were stolen from the house, street, garage, shops and so on; when the vehicle <Col N="838" /> was recovered; whether the theft was reported to the Garda Síochána; what type of crime people were victims of; whether they were injured; whether they have burglar alarms in their houses and, if so, whether they work and so on.</P>
    <P>One question in which I am interested asks the main reason for not reporting a crime to the Garda Síochána. A number of possible answers are supplied. The questions mainly relate to personal experiences but I do not know if they are regionally based.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Minister of State's reply is very positive in that it highlights the fact that the number of emigrants is down by 7,800 on the previous 12 months. It also highlights the reverse of the situation in previous generations when there was a mass exodus from the country. This has led to a situation in which more people are coming into the country than are leaving &ndash; a net inflow of 22,800. Does the Minister of State have on file the origin of these people? How many came from the United Kingdom, other European Union countries, the USA and the rest of the world? How many people could be categorised as refugees?</P>

      <P>The formula used for estimating the total inflow of immigrants in 1998 was complicated. The information derives from the quarterly national survey, airline inquiries, passenger inquiries, country of residence inquiries, child benefit schemes, the number of visas granted, etc. The estimate is an amalgam of that information. The number of immigrants was 44,000 in 1998, of whom 21,000 came from the United Kingdom, 8,700 from the rest of the EU, 4,900 from the United States of America and 9,300 from the rest of the world. I do not have a categorisation for people who claimed asylum. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would have those figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that it was intended the committee would, in so far as possible, meet on a monthly basis. The figures I outlined indicate the schedule. The committee meets as frequently as possible and we endeavour to do so on a monthly basis. The committee met twice in October 1998, on 1 and 29 October.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy when he last raised this general issue, methadone treatment was discussed briefly at meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs. We are awaiting detailed information from the national drugs strategy team because this issue is hotly debated in the public arena by professionals, users and carers. I expect the issue probably will be dealt with in more detail when the advisory committee is established. I am happy to inform the Deputy that I have circulated proposals on the establishment of this committee to my relevant ministerial colleagues and I have received their responses. I hope to be in a position in the next two to three months to announce the establishment of the advisory group. It will be able to independently address issues of the type raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>It was proposed in the original ministerial task force report, drawn up under the auspices of the then Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that an advisory group should be established to give independent advice to the Government of the day. All Members support that initiative on the basis that there are conflicting views with regard to treatment, etc. We will consider specific terms of reference in the establishment of that body and consult the sub-group which is currently examining this issue. However, the terms of reference will conform with the original intention of the advisory group as proposed in the ministerial task force report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister of State's reference to the current emphasis on methadone, does he agree the lack of rehabilitation and after care services is one of the reasons for the increasing waiting lists? There are approximately 600 to 700 people on waiting lists for clinics. For example, the city clinic in Amiens Street currently provides methadone to 350 addicts. These people cannot move on to anywhere else so they continue to accept methadone <Col N="843" /> in the clinic. A waiting list builds up because of the lack of rehabilitation and after care services. Has the original objective of securing private sector corporate funding to supplement the money available to the committee been realised? Will the Minister of State clarify the position in that regard?</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the second issue raised by Deputy Gregory, funding from the corporate sector is through the Irish Youth Foundation which makes a significant contribution towards the provision of facilities and services for disadvantaged young people in specific areas covered by local drugs task forces. We will be in a position shortly to announce the level of that contribution. It is substantial and increasing. We are pleased about that because it complements Government funding.</P>
      <P>On rehabilitation and care of misusers as they proceed through treatment, my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has provided up to 1,000 FÁS places for that area. There has been some delay in the take-up of those places because it depends on individuals coming through the treatment services being in a position to take up a place. We are currently developing those places and they will make an important contribution towards the care and rehabilitation of misusers.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the private sector to be more willing to employ misusers who are going through the treatment process. We understand the complexities of the issue, but I propose to contact the employers to discuss this matter formally because they too have a significant role to play, though I accept responsibility for ensuring that care and rehabilitation is provided, and that the National Drugs Strategy Team has an important role to play in this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 116 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>Article 19 of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997 provides that each local authority is responsible for the enforcement of the regulations within its functional area, and requires authorities to take such steps as are necessary for this purpose. In addition to the general powers which are available to local authorities under the Waste Management Act, 1996, the 1997 regulations include a number of provisions specifically intended to facilitate the effective implementation and enforcement of the regulations.</P>
      <P>In particular, a local authority may require a producer of packaging, other than one certified by an approved body, i.e. by Repak Limited, to furnish a &ldquo;packaging report&rdquo; or such other information as may be required in relation to compliance by that producer with any specified requirement of the regulations. Furthermore, in a prosecution for a failure to comply with the regulations, the onus is placed on a producer to satisfy the court that he is not a major producer.</P>
      <P>I have no direct function in relation to the enforcement of the 1997 regulations by local authorities. Nevertheless, these regulations are designed to ensure that responsibility for recycling packaging waste is spread equitably among packaging producers, and I would be concerned that producers who are compliant members of the packaging waste recovery scheme operated by Repak Limited are not placed at a commercial disadvantage by free-riders who evade their obligations under the regulations. Accordingly, my Department has, where possible, endeavoured to facilitate the effective implementation and enforcement of the regulations by local authorities generally.</P>
      <P>However, on the basis of the information available to my Department, a considerable improvement for the future in the performance of local authorities is required. I consider that many local authorities should devote more resources to the enforcement of the 1997 regulations and I am hopeful that a more high profile enforcement effort will be apparent in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="845" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was whether the Minister has carried out any assessment of the enforcement. May I take it from the Minister's rather roundabout reply that the answer to that question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that he has not carried out an assessment? Is the Minister aware that Repak Limited carried out a survey of the rate of compliance with these regulations last December? Is he aware that no companies have registered anywhere with any local authority? Is he aware that they have failed to do that although they are obliged to do so? Is he further aware that local authorities have done nothing to make any company anywhere in the country conform to any aspect of these regulations? Would he not agree that almost three years after the passage of the Act, and almost two years after the adoption of the regulations, that indicates a total abdication of his functions by the Minister and his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked what local authorities were doing. The enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the local authorities, not the Minister. Nevertheless, I accept Deputy Dukes's point about lack of activity by local authorities. I am aware of the survey he mentioned. I am also aware that most of the information he has given is accurate. However, it is important to point out that local authorities did contact companies specified on a list provided by Repak Limited to ensure that they were registered either with Repak Limited or with the local authority. I have no direct responsibility for the enforcement of these regulations, but I am as concerned as the Deputy about the scheme. I accept the point he makes in regard to enforcement and the role of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I and the Minister of State have had direct contact with local authorities and local authority management has stressed the importance of enforcement. As a result of the contacts we have made with local authorities and the assistance, including financial assistance, that we have given them, I am hopeful that performance in the coming year will be better than it was in the past two years. I do not deny what the Deputy said about performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister is the tutelary authority here, has he any fears that sanctions might be applied to this country because of the non-performance of our obligations under EU directives in this matter? If there is such a danger, will he inform the local authorities that they in turn might be in danger of sanctions from him if they fail to meet their obligations under this Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made it clear to the local authorities what their responsibility is. Apart from reaching targets which have to be met under EU obligations, I am most concerned that companies that are compliant, that have joined Repak Limited, might decide to withdraw because the regulations are not being enforced. If <Col N="846" /> we do not reach targets we will be penalised. I see the local government fund as a mechanism that could be used to penalise local authorities who do not fulfil obligations which have been imposed by Europe and by this House through legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On foot of the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups, and in response to increasing needs, the local authority housing programme for 1999 will be expanded to 4,500 &ldquo;starts&rdquo;, the highest number of &ldquo;starts&rdquo; since 1986. Significantly increased capital resources will be provided for the local authority housing programmes in 1999; almost £230 million is currently available, an increase of £35 million on last year. This will meet expenditure commitments in the ongoing programme at end 1998 as well as the &ldquo;starts&rdquo; authorised for 1999.</P>
      <P>I directed that the next comprehensive assessments of local authority housing needs should be carried out by local authorities on 31 March. Guidelines on the undertaking of the assessments were issued to all local authorities. The assessment will provide details of the extent and nature of housing needs in each local authority area. The last statutory assessment of local authority housing needs was carried out on 29 March 1996 and disclosed that the number of households assessed as being in need of local authority housing was 27,400. Details of that assessment are provided in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for 1996, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority housing programme is supplemented by a range of other social housing measures in meeting social housing needs, such as the new affordable housing scheme that I announced yesterday, voluntary housing, shared ownership, etc.. It is for each housing authority to develop the full potential of the various measures open to them to respond to housing needs in their areas and I have regularly exhorted authorities to do so. The new scheme, and improvements I made during 1998 in the voluntary housing capital <Col N="847" /> assistance and shared ownership schemes, will result in increased housing output from these schemes in 1999.</P>
    <P>I expect that approximately 3,700 houses will be completed or purchased by local authorities in 1999. These, together with output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing housing stock, will enable more than 10,500 households to be catered for in 1999 compared to 9,300 in 1998. I am confident that the greatly increased provision for the 1999 social housing programmes will considerably enhance the capacity of local authorities to meet social housing needs to the fullest extent in the current circumstances.</P>

      <P>It is intended as an additional option to increase the flow of affordable houses. I hope that local authorities will respond quickly to the new scheme and get projects under way. Hopefully, some houses will start this year. Two local authorities have projects in mind, with sites allocated, which would greatly benefit from the scheme. I expect that they will soon come forward with proposals.</P>
      <P>The output from other local authorities depends on their responses. They are the housing authorities and we are providing this attractive package to assist people, who find that their incomes are not large enough, to purchase a home. Through the mortgage subsidy element of this scheme their income requirements for loan repayments will be approximately 30 per cent of their net income and in those cases local authorities will make a judgment as to whether people have the capacity to repay the loans. It is geared at those who currently are unable to purchase a house and they will be able to do so without a profit element added in by the market. The houses will be constructed by the local authorities without any add-on, other than 0.5 per cent on the interest rate, which is to cover administration expenses.</P>

After all that consideration and discussion can he not tell the House that even a single dwelling will be provided under this scheme in 1999?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department received almost 200 written responses to the consultation paper on Genetically Modified Organisms and the Environment, which I issued on 24 August 1998. I invited all the respondents to participate in an open two part debate, which will be held this spring, for the purpose of concluding the consultation process concerning potential risks to the environment arising from the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms.</P>
      <P>The debate will be independently chaired and managed under arrangements which I am putting in place. The objective of the first part of the debate is to identify the most critical national issues which should influence the review of national policy and procedures on the deliberate release of GMOs to the environment. The issues identified will be analysed in depth in the second part of the debate. On foot of a report from the chairperson of the debate and having regard to the written responses to the consultation paper, I intend to complete the review of national policy and procedures in this area and make a statement on the outcome.</P>
      <P>A panel will be constituted to lead and respond to the debate to assist the independent chair. This will comprise nominees of four representative stakeholders identified from the written responses to the consultation paper. The four stakeholders, each of whom has been invited to nominate two persons to the panel, are the State, the biotechnology sector, non-governmental organisations and the academic/research world. This is intended as a utility to assist in structuring and focusing the debate on the key environmental issues for the general body of respondents.</P>
      <P>As part of the arrangements for the consultation debate, I arranged a meeting of a group of 19 NGOs identified from written submissions as representative stakeholders in the overall process. The purpose of this meeting, held on 18 February, was to facilitate the group to prepare for the debate and to identify its two nominees for the debate panel. Following the all-day meeting, the group issued a statement in which it raised a number of issues about the structure of the debate and proposed an alternative process. While I am disappointed it was not possible for the group to reach a more constructive conclusion in the context of the consultation process I initiated and which is now well advanced, I do not regard its statement as a withdrawal. I have written to the representatives nominated by the group requesting clarification of their position and I await their response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are obviously in contact with them, but I want to clarify matters for the Deputy because there seems to be some confusion, even among the NGOs which responded. The consultation process I initiated was directly related to genetically modified organisms and the environment. It is focused on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment and is framed in the context of two EU directives, 92/19 and 92/20. Neither I nor the Department has direct responsibility for food or health, which are separate matters. The issue being addressed in this consultation process is GMOs and the environment and their deliberate release in one form or another, be it for research and development purposes or marketing. I do not want the issues to be confused.</P>
      <P>It has become increasingly clear over the past 12 months that the other issues need to be addressed. It was for that reason I brought an <i>aide-mémoire</i> to Government, which indicated that other Departments should employ their consultation methods to focus on the points the Deputy raised, such as novel foods and health. An interdepartmental group has been established as a result of that memorandum to deal with those issues. I do not want the issues to become confused. There is an urgency about the consultation process because the two directives are currently being reviewed in Europe. I want the consultation process and the final position we adopt to inform our position at those talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is an urgency, because discussions are ongoing in Europe and it is important we know Government policy on the matter beforehand. Does the Minister have a view on a moratorium on the planting of these crops? Does he know if that will form part of Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>A moratorium has been proposed in the consultation process by a number of NGOs. It will be considered, as will all other issues raised which are directly relevant to the subject. It is not currently possible for a member <Col N="851" /> state to unilaterally declare a moratorium on the deliberate release of GMOs. We would be in breach of EU directives and law were we to do so. It is something which has been identified as an issue in the ongoing consultation and may end up being one of the key issues people will want discussed in the two part consultation process.</P>

      <P>Provisional house price statistics for the December 1998 quarter, which will be published shortly, suggest a moderation in the rate of house price increases and this is supported by views from market sources and commentators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures introduced in the Government's Action on House Prices addressed factors that <Col N="856" /> were causing overheating or distortions in the market and were designed to restore a better balance between supply and demand. Measures to assist first-time buyers formed a key element of the package, including the removal of fiscal incentives to investors, who had been pricing low-income buyers out of the housing market; an increase in the income limits for the local authority shared ownership scheme; significant reductions in stamp duty rates, particularly at lower price levels; and measures to boost housing supply, through the serviced land initiative and increased residential density. There is broad consensus that Government actions have played a key role in achieving price slowdown and will continue to have beneficial effects in stabilising house prices.</P>
    <P>Increasing the supply of housing, particularly affordable housing, remains the key element of the Government's housing policy. The measures in Action on House Prices are designed to secure a continuation of the growth in housing output and alleviate the bottlenecks or constraints on housing supply. Housing output reached a new record in 1998 at 42,349 units, and we are actually building new houses at twice the level of 1993. Leading indicators, such as the volume of planning applications and HomeBond registrations, suggest continuation of the trend of increased housing output.</P>
    <P>The new affordable housing scheme I announced yesterday is designed to help lower income households to purchase their own houses. It involves the provision by local authorities of additional new houses specifically for such low income purchasers, up to £20,000 in the case of single income households. Low interest mortgages and, in the case of households with income up to £16,000, a subsidy towards repayments will be provided under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The 1999 water and sewerage investment programme, launched recently, is again at a record level. Over £275 million will be spent on water and sewerage infrastructural development this year and the potential for this investment to bring more residential land into service will be maximised. Furthermore, the serviced land initiative should yield in the region of 100,000 additional housing sites over this year and next, through the provision of £44 million of Exchequer funding for water, sewerage and roads infrastructure specifically to open up extra land for housing.</P>
    <P>Increased residential density is a further key element in the Government's strategy to increase housing supply. Planning authorities have been advised to promote higher densities at appropriate locations and planning guidelines on residential density were published on 2 March for public consultation.</P>
    <P>Ongoing implementation of the Government's strategy and monitoring of its effects is a priority for my Department to ensure that all of the measures produce beneficial results as soon as possible. The Government is keeping policy in this area under close review in the light of the <Col N="857" /> effects of the measures taken and developments in the housing market, with particular emphasis on ensuring continued increase in housing supply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that Second Stage speech. Would he recognise that since the publication of the Bacon report house prices have continued to increase? What is the current rate of house price inflation? Would he recognise that there has been a considerable increase in the price of a typical starter home from the middle of last year to the beginning of this year?</P>
      <P>With regard to his announcement yesterday, when does he intend to publish guidelines to local authorities on the implementation of this scheme? Will they be similar to the guidelines launched some 14 weeks after the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998?</P>
      <P>Does he recognise that Dublin local authorities are bemused by this local authority scheme which he has asked them to implement? Does he recognise that there is a diminishing land bank available in the city and surrounding area and many of the houses will be built at the expense of the social housing programme throughout the local authority areas in Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>House price statistics for the December quarter 1998, which I stated will be published shortly, show that, compared with the December quarter 1997, new house prices increased by 26 per cent in Dublin and 23 per cent nationally while secondhand prices increased by 27 per cent in Dublin and 29 per cent nationally in the same period.</P>
      <P>The December 1998 figures represent a significantly lower quarterly rate of price increase for secondhand houses in Dublin&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;less than 1 per cent, compared with an overall rate of increase of 10 per cent for this category in the September quarter.</P>
      <P>The rate of increase for new houses in Dublin reduced significantly in the September quarter. While the rate of increase in new house prices was slightly higher in the December quarter, explained by the fact that one institution includes figures for an expensive apartment complex, the increase for the second half of 1998 was 6.9 per cent compared with an increase of 17.6 per cent in the first half of the year. This trend is also confirmed by data published recently by Irish Permanent, which indicated that price growth in the second half of 1998 was significantly lower than in the first half.</P>
      <P>In reply to the second part of the Deputy's question, the local authority house building programme will be proceeded with and the affordable housing scheme announced yesterday will provide additional houses&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister recognise that house prices are getting out of the reach of the first-time buyer, and that the Bacon report and the Government's implementation of Action on House Prices have done precious little to resolve the crisis in the housing market?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that he has received a proposal from the Bank of Ireland to allow shared ownership, a concept which it has mooted for some time? What is his position on this proposal? Will he be announcing further measures in light of the proposal received from the Bank of Ireland or, indeed, other organisations? He did not answer the question on the guidelines.</P>

      <P>The detailed circular letter from the Department, which is the traditional way of explaining the detail of schemes, will be issuing from the Department in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Bank of Ireland proposal has not been found acceptable because the Government is anxious to ensure that the measures it introduces are on the supply side and do not inflate the demand side.</P>
      <P>It was deemed that the Bank of Ireland proposal would not necessarily provide additional housing but that it would provide additional funding for a system where money was not a problem. The problem is that more people are looking for houses than there are houses being provided. The criterion must be whether this will achieve an increase in the level of housing output rather than add new purchasers to the list of existing purchasers seeking a limited number of houses. Any action that will inflate the demand side will only make the price situation worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed some satisfaction that the December figures are showing what he calls moderation in house price increases. I took note of the December 1998 figures as against those for December 1997 &ndash; 26 per cent, 23 per cent, 27 per cent and 29 per cent respectively for the different categories. Is the Minister seriously telling the House that he is satisfied with house price rises which are ten times the rate of inflation? Is it his view, as is the view of many commentators, that notwithstanding the parts of the Bacon report selectively implemented by the Government, investors are now back in the market due to low interest rates and so on? Will the Minister answer the part of the question I asked earlier to which he did not reply? Will a couple earning £15,000 each qualify for the initiative he announced yesterday?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> Progress to date is particularly encouraging in view of continued strong economic growth and reduced interest rates. An increased supply of housing is the only way to meet the unprecedented increase in demand, bringing the market into balance and stabilising house prices.

The Government is delivering on action to achieve this.</P>

      <P>As we are dealing with the question of house prices, may I ask the Minister of State about the planning process? A recent report by IBEC showed that there is now an average wait of two years for planning permission on all major housing estate developments. Does the Minister of State agree this is not good enough and that we have to work to reduce that timescale? What measures does the Government intend to introduce to ensure a more streamlined planning process? I accept what the Minister of State says about the supply of housing, but an increase in the housing supply will be achieved only if we have a more streamlined planning process. We have not had that to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has responsibility for planning. He has already issued a statement in response to that report denying its accuracy. Recent statistics show that planning permission have increased enormously in the last 12 months. This is a good indication of housing output in 1999 and 2000.</P>
      <P>The planning process, at local authority and An Bord Pleanála level, is critical to ensuring the smooth operation of the house building industry and the achievement of output objectives. Steps have been taken with regard to staffing at local authority level. Staff numbers have been increased in An Bord Pleanála and the number of board members has been increased. Discussions are under way with regard to further strengthening staffing levels in local authorities and in An Bord Pleanála to remove constraints and clear bottlenecks in the system. These, of course, delay output and add to costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports of claims of an increased incidence of evictions from private rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>The rights of tenants of such accommodation and the protection available to them are, in the first place, governed by the terms of the lease or other tenancy agreement under which the tenancies are held. These are subject to the provisions of the landlord and tenant code which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In considering security of tenure issues, there is a need to achieve a fair balance between the rights of both tenants and landlords in a way that is compatible with constitutional requirements and that ensures a continuing investment in the provision and maintenance of rented accommodation. I will consider, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, what further action may be warranted and open to us in relation to security of tenure of rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State sounds as if he is giving secondhand information on the rate of evictions and as if he casts some doubt on the validity of the information about the number of evictions. Has the Department carried out an assessment of the number of evictions taking place and the reasons for them? Is the Minister of State aware that large numbers of people are facing eviction from private rented accommodation, either because their landlords are moving up-market or are selling the properties? In the last part of his reply the Minister of State informed us that he and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are examining the question of landlord and tenant law. Does he or his colleague intend to introduce legislation to amend landlord and tenant law to provide greater security for tenants and to put some control on the excessive increases in rent which are being experienced by tenants in private rented accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surveys have shown a positive correlation between increases in house prices and increases in rents. All of this arises from the scarcity in the housing market and the advantage being taken by some landlords.  Legislation in this area comes under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, I made inquiries in his Department and I have been informed that official statistics are not available on the number of evictions from private rented dwellings in that Department. The statement that evictions have increased fivefold was made by Threshold. It may be relying on information compiled in its offices for the claim of a fivefold increase in 1998. I am grateful to Threshold for the valuable information it makes available which helps in the formulation of housing policy and initiatives in the area of housing. I am <Col N="866" /> very supportive of Threshold and I accept its findings. There are no official statistics, but it is clear, from sources in the property business, that rents have been increasing at a rate equal to the rise in house prices. It is not acceptable that rents should increase because landlords are taking advantage of the current situation. The only long-term solution to this problem is to restore balance to the housing market. Measures such as the integrated area plans, which I announced last week, will help to bring more rented accommodation onto the market. A large amount of rented accommodation has been provided by the section 23 provision and urban renewal schemes in the past. The quality and quantity of rented accommodation are both greater than ten or 15 years ago. However, we are in an era of high demand and this is causing difficulties.</P>
      <P>On 9 February I wrote to the Attorney General asking that a detailed examination be carried out, by an expert in the area, of the scope that may exist to improve security of tenure in private residential accommodation, having regard to constitutional rights and legal issues. Last year, I wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on a formal basis, on the question of examining ways to provide greater security of tenure. An assurance was given by that Department that, as far as other priorities permit, the matter would be put on its agenda and kept under review.</P>
      <P>Legislation dealing with the provision of greater security of tenure would have to take account of the complex nature of the landlord and tenant code and of the constitutional issues. Opposition from landlords can be expected to any attempt to interfere with their rights to recover and use their properties as they see fit. A fair and equitable balance of rights between both parties cannot be easily achieved, but I am anxious to do that.</P>
      <P>Part of the assistance I gave to Threshold consisted of the funding of an international conference to examine the area of rented housing. This was held to ascertain the options available and to learn of the experience of other countries in this area. I had hoped we might get opinions and expert advice from countries outside Europe, but most of the speakers came from the European region. However, there may be other opportunities at a later date to do that. Two main findings emerged from that conference. There is no country in Europe to which we can look for evidence of best practice and European governments, in general, are relaxing controls on the private rental sector. Regulation can prohibit property holders from making their property available for rent. It is necessary to strike the right balance. Irrespective of our constitutional difficulties and existing legislation, there is a need to introduce legislation to provide greater security of tenure for tenants while recognising the rights of landlords.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to accept that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot assemble information about the number of evictions, which is readily available in the offices of the county sheriff and the courts. That may indicate the degree of priority with which the matter is being treated in the Department. Does the Minister of State accept that rents for private accommodation are outside the reach of many young working people? As the law stands, landlords can charge what rent they like, they can increase rents to any level and they can seek and get the eviction of their tenants through the courts. Having regard to the balance described by the Minister of State in his reply, does he think that is fair to the tenant? Will he or the Minister for Justice introduce legislation to restore some degree of balance for tenants?</P>

Many tenants in Dublin city are committed to paying £400, £500 or up to £800 per month in rent. That new scheme will not help those tenants.

Is he now signalling a change of policy in regard to the announcement that was made on the latest urban renewal programmes?</P>
      <P>He will remember that, contrary to our expectations, the latest urban renewal scheme is confined to residential development in the designated areas. Am I right in recalling that in the announcement of that scheme it was stated that section 23 or section 27 measures would be available on a very limited basis and only in cases where they were essential to the achievement of the objectives of the IAP?

It is expected that there might be a response to the investor incentives in the areas in which they have been sanctioned and that rental accommodation might be provided.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was zoning for investors in certain urban areas to achieve the objectives of the local authority. There was a large number in the Dublin region in large areas of social housing in order to achieve a better mix by bringing some private housing into the area. That was to achieve a socio-economic objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the same occasion that I announced the IAPs, I stated that the Government had decided that a new scheme should be drawn up for smaller towns. The guidelines will be prepared by the same committee of experts and will be issued to the local authorities in April, it is hoped. Those who wish to respond will be invited to submit applications for smaller towns for tax incentives which could include residential investors to achieve certain objectives, or residential owner <Col N="872" /> occupiers to achieve other social objectives or settlement policies. These options are there.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked if there will be a more liberal approach. The only reason I am responding about the smaller towns is that there are additional numbers of areas that may be designated for investor incentives under section 23.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley mentioned the Madigan ruling. Paddy Madigan is an old university colleague of mine. He said that people informed him at the conference that there are no constitutional difficulties. I met these people and I am aware of that opinion. However, it is an issue that has to be resolved in the Irish context. It is an important housing issue that needs to be quickly addressed. I have already said in reply to an earlier question that I consider this type of matter to be probably a suitable subject for the work of a special committee that would focus directly on it and clear it up once and for all.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise, in reply to Deputy Gilmore, that I am not a Cabinet Minister <i>per se</i>&ndash; I am a junior Minister who attends Cabinet meetings.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with the reorganisation of the health board, a mammoth job that has been talked about for many years. I have never been a member of the Eastern Health Board, unlike my colleague opposite, Deputy Shortall. Perhaps people who have been members, particularly those who have chaired it for a few years, know their way around it, but I have always found it to be an absolute monster in my dealings with it. I found it very difficult to tap into it. In my many dealings with officials over the years, I often got the impression that many of them did not know what was going on in their own organisation. I accept, therefore, the argument for change and reorganisation.</P>
      <P>We had a briefing last year which Deputy Shortall organised. At the beginning of the briefing they talked about the number of locations of the health board, which was over 300. While I might criticise the health board for its lack of organisation, the number of locations in which staff are based puts some of my views in context. Obviously, it is difficult for an organisation of that size to know what is going on within it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the need for a new <Col N="874" /> organisation which would be more patient-focused. The health board is already a big authority and I am concerned that it might turn into an even bigger bureaucracy if we give it more functions. I have seen reorganisation occurring in other State and semi-State bodies; sometimes the original purpose of the reorganisation is forgotten along the line and it turns into the creation of more jobs for the girls and boys. In the midst of the petty squabbling which may occur, the basic service and client is forgotten. I hope the new authority will keep its real purpose in sight and realise it is not about the glorification of individuals within it.</P>
    <P>I am pleased about the number of public representatives on the new authority. Although I have never been a member of a health board, some eight or ten years ago I was involved in local health committees which I found very beneficial. For the past 14 years I have been a member of a local authority which elects members to represent it on the health board. I do not hear from them in any formal way, although that may be as much my fault as theirs. The local health committees provided me with direct access to some health board officials. I would like to think public representatives who are not members of the authority would be consulted on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I have read the reports which have recommended change in the health board structure. However, one must be cautious when a group wants more control and power. I am concerned about health boards or health authorities trying to get their hands on the voluntary hospitals. I wonder whether that would be a good thing or whether we would be playing into the hands of control freaks. This Bill has been in gestation for many years and the groups it will affect have had plenty of time to reflect on what might happen to them.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board does some marvellous work. The Minister referred to the manner in which the health board has changed in the past 30 years to deal with the increase in population levels and social problems. In my constituency, the health board has been slow to deal with some of these social problems, such as drug addiction, homelessness, child care and so on, although it has become more involved recently. Perhaps funding was one of the problems, but it was not always the stated reason. The health board appeared to be rather bureaucratic at times in its failure to reach out to the community. Perhaps it did not receive the full backing of public representatives in many cases. However, even when such support was forthcoming, the health board was slow to reach out. Child care will be the major challenge facing it in the future. A great deal of taxpayers' money goes towards the funding of the health board and it is important that patients and clients are kept centre stage. I am concerned that the new authority will not be hijacked by people seeking to put themselves centre stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> Concern has been expressed by voluntary hospitals in regard to some of the structures being proposed. Those concerns will have to be taken on board. Amendments could be considered on Committee or Report Stages to assure the voluntary hospitals that they are not being taken over. Voluntary hospitals have done a great deal of good work over the years and their concerns should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I understand some specific concern has been expressed about section 8(3)(e) which states that the new authority, in performing its duties, should have regard to the rights of persons operating voluntary hospitals to manage their own affairs in accordance with their independent ethos and traditions. The phrase &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; is considered by some to be very weak. Concern has also been expressed about section 8(4) which some people feel confers an unfair advantage on Tallaght Hospital over other teaching hospitals in the region. It has been suggested that one interpretation of the section could render it contrary to Article 44 of the Constitution which provides that the State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status. These concerns have not been allayed fully.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had his battles with Tallaght Hospital. He may feel he was too hard on it and, like a good gentleman from the midlands, wants to kiss and make up. Perhaps he is conferring a stronger status on it in the Bill than that enjoyed by other hospitals. That may put him into the good books with Tallaght Hospital and restore relations between it and the Department of Health and Children. However, in reaching out the hand of friendship to Tallaght Hospital is he being fair to the other voluntary hospitals? Is he bestowing on Tallaght Hospital a higher status than that given to other voluntary hospitals? We all know Tallaght Hospital has not been in existence for long and that it is an amalgamation of three hospitals. We also know it has difficulties and problems with its charter. Perhaps the Minister must be seen to try to make the administration there happy, but there is a concern that the legislation has gone too far and favours Tallaght over the other voluntary teaching hospitals. I would like to hear his comments in this regard and hope that if my comments are valid amendments will be considered. The time to consider amendments is on Committee Stage, not when somebody outside wishes to push the issue and when lawyers begin fighting in the courts, something which would cost us all a fortune. All voluntary teaching hospitals should be treated in the same way and none should be favoured above another.</P>
    <P>There is also concern among some voluntary hospitals in relation to funding for their specialties. The Eastern Regional Authority will be concerned for the patients and clients within the region. However, the voluntary hospitals have pursued and been recognised as having national <Col N="876" /> specialties in different fields. I often think they are more interested in expanding their specialties than in looking after patients in their casualty departments. Voluntary hospitals are very proud in this context and are always pushing out the boat in terms of their national specialties. There is concern that the status of these specialties may not be fully recognised by the new authority. I understand that the interim report examining the new authority discussed this issue, but I am informed it is not mentioned in the Bill. This is perceived as an omission which must be rectified.</P>
    <P>Will the new authority say it is only interested in people if they come from Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare or Meath, and that those coming from Galway or Kerry are the responsibility of somebody else? Perhaps this has been thrashed out at length, but concern still seems to exist. There is a communication problem somewhere. I know we all fear change in certain respects, but there is nervousness and concern that if control is passed over to, for example, Dr. Steeven's Hospital, the national specialties of hospitals will not be recognised as they previously were.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed about capital expenditure. The Bill makes statutory provision for the payment of current expenses for services but does not provide for capital expenditure which is essential for delivering services in the future. These concerns must be addressed. Perhaps it is correct that the Department should control the purse strings in relation to capital expenditure and perhaps it will not hand full control to the new health authority. It may be necessary to make amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are also concerns about the overall funding mechanism. Some people feel there is a conflict of interest on the part of the ERA as the purchaser of services is also ultimately responsible for the delivery of statutory services by the three area health boards. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the precise decision-making mechanism in relation to the allocation of funds. In particular I would like to know the decision-making process in relation to the allocation of funds by the Minister to the authority and by the authority to the health board areas and the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes the phrase &ldquo;the resources available to the authority&rdquo;. Some people are asking that this be defined for the purposes of the Bill to ensure it includes those services being provided by voluntary bodies within the functional area of the authority. It is important that any such definition does not mean the service will only be provided to people residing in the functional area of the authority as this could run contrary to the mission of voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there is concern that due recognition be given to the additional resources required by acute voluntary teaching hospitals to fulfil their teaching commitments. There is also concern that section 10 appears to delegate to the authority the function of determining future policy as to whether developments within the health services <Col N="877" /> should be primarily in the voluntary sector, the institutions under the management of health boards, or in combination. Some voluntary bodies have obtained legal opinion. I am always dubious about legal opinion as I think one can get whatever legal opinion one wants depending on who pays for it. However, the time to sort out conflicting opinion, if such exists, is before the Bill is passed rather than having various bodies wasting time and energy and using taxpayers' money fighting a battle for control instead of dealing with the real problems faced by the health service.</P>
    <P>There is also a request that the Bill include a definition of a voluntary body. Currently the Bill simply specifies a voluntary body for the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>These are some of the concerns of voluntary hospitals. I know these views have been submitted directly to the Minister and I am sure they are being studied in the Department. I like to think that an attempt will be made to keep everybody on board so that everybody can identify with the Bill, feel it is fair, claim ownership of it and look forward to a new structure for health services in the eastern region, and that it is not a case of bureaucracy or the control freaks winning.</P>
    <P>In such measures where things are being drawn together some people will fear that they might be losing some authority over their patch. Every opportunity should be taken to reassure people in this regard, specifically in the context of Tallaght Hospital which I know has had a difficult birth. Some of the other voluntary hospitals have connections with Catholic orders and while the day of giving special recognition to one church may be gone, we should not be seen to be going in a particular direction in this Bill. The perception of some people is that Tallaght Hospital is being recognised and is receiving a status over and above that given to the other voluntary hospitals. It is a touchy subject and the Minister may be playing all sides against the middle and walking a tight rope, but I like to think that further work will be done and that some amendments will be brought forward to perhaps change some of the sections, thereby allowing all voluntary hospitals feel they are part of the new structure and feel happy within it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the eventual arrival in the House of this Bill. As the previous speaker said, restructuring of the Eastern Health Board has been spoken about for many years and many promises were made, but it was not until 1996 that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, made the formal announcement on the proposals to restructure &ndash; this time for real. Unfortunately, it has taken since 1996 to draft the Bill, publish it and debate it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the principles underlying this Bill, but it is merely the principles I welcome. I have very serious difficulties with much of the detail of the Bill with which I will deal later. I welcome the principle of devolving health ser<Col N="878" /> vices to community level so that services can be more responsive to the consumers' needs and be more relevant to the local community. When the health boards were set up in the 1970s, Dublin was quite a different place. Eight health boards were set up and the Eastern Health Board was by far the largest.</P>
    <P>Relative to the other areas, the east has grown substantially in terms of population. The Eastern Health Board caters for the needs of 1.3 million people with a budget of £500 million and a staff of 9,500. If we compare that to other health boards where the average population served is between 200,000 and 400,000 and with much smaller budgets and staff numbers, it is probably no wonder the Eastern Health Board has been seen by many as a monster, as Deputy Noel Ahern referred to it. It has been a large, unwieldy and, in many ways, unresponsive organisation.</P>
    <P>This is partly due to the fact that the area is so large, the staff is so vast and that it has been trying to operate under the same type of programme manager structure which exists in the other health boards with much smaller populations. It stands to reason that an acute hospitals manager trying to serve the needs of 1.3 million people cannot be as responsive to individual needs as the programme manager trying to serve 300,000. There have been major problems of scale in relation to the operation the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>In areas outside the east, there is much stronger local identification with the local health board. The general feeling among people, particularly in the Dublin area, is that the Eastern Health Board is a large, unfriendly and unwieldy organisation somewhere in town. They do not have that local sense of being part of the health services, which certainly causes problems. It has also resulted in a situation where needs have not been sufficiently addressed.</P>
    <P>I remember a couple of years ago when I was chair of the Eastern Health Board coming across a group of people in the Darndale area who had concerns about a number of social issues there. They came to meet me, as chair, and the chief executive officer. It turned out that this area of huge social need with a very large child population and all the attendant social problems in working class areas did not even have something as basic as a health centre. That struck me as quite extraordinary. It would never occur outside Dublin that an area equivalent in size to a reasonable town would not have basic health facilities.</P>
    <P>I concluded the reasons for that were twofold. The first was that there were no public representatives from the Darndale area on the Eastern Health Board and, therefore, there was nobody fighting their corner. The other was that the senior executives in the Eastern Health Board were simply too far removed from local community difficulties and that the operation was delivered from town where managers were trying to take an overall view, cater for the needs of the entire area and did not have that hands on approach to local needs. It was another argument <Col N="879" /> to restructure the Eastern Health Board to make it more sensitive to the needs of local areas.</P>
    <P>The same point was made by Deputy Noel Ahern about the lack of responsiveness by the Eastern Health Board some years ago to the emerging drug problem. To a large extent, the health board has now got on top of that but there is no doubt this problem was overlooked or denied by senior management for years. That meant that a few years ago we were desperately trying to catch up with the neglect of the past. To a large extent, the same can be said about the child protection and child welfare services. Because there have not been senior people at local level, many of these problems have been overlooked and neglected for years.</P>
    <P>I very much agree we need to restructure, to have smaller health boards which are closer to the people they serve with a narrower remit so that rather than having people from south Wicklow travelling to places such as Balbriggan and Lusk trying to come to terms with the local issues there, those people will be able to deal with their own matters and the people in the north Dublin area will deal with issues affecting their constituents. That is a much more satisfactory way to proceed.</P>
    <P>We should have devolved boards. Because of the particular nature of the problems in Dublin and the fact it is a capital city, there is a definite role for a regional authority and the type of strategic planning required in a large capital city where there is much cross over between different board areas and where strategic decisions need to be taken in relation to specialising in the different areas of medicine and so on, where practical decisions have to be taken and where there is a need for an overview in relation to the health status of the population in the eastern region. I agree very much with the principles involved in that.</P>
    <P>The other major measure under this Bill will bring the voluntary hospitals and agencies, particularly mental handicap agencies, under the umbrella of the health board. There is an unusual situation in the east which does not obtain in other health board areas where the bulk of health spending is done outside the health board. It is an incredible situation and very often the health board gets blamed for hospital waiting lists or inadequacies in hospital or mental handicap services when in fact the health board has no control over them. That is a fundamental flaw in the way our health services are delivered in the east.</P>
    <P>By bringing the voluntary hospitals and other agencies under the one umbrella, strategic decisions may be taken at board level on the way health funding is spent. I am thinking in particular about decisions which need to be taken on spending in expensive acute hospitals, for example, compared to spending at community care level. It is not possible for those debates to take place at the moment because the health boards look after community care and the volun<Col N="880" /> tary hospitals look after high technology expensive medicine. There is no forum in which that debate can take place. It is important to establish that type of accountability in the delivery of our health services.</P>
    <P>The large voluntary hospitals in the Dublin area have operated as independent republics. Depending of the Minister of the day, one hospital might get the ear of that particular Minister in a more effective way than another and secure funding in that manner. That is, of course, highly unsatisfactory and means there is little or no accountability in the system. I welcome the proposals to bring together all the health agencies under one umbrella. A budget of £1.2 billion or £1.3 billion will be spent in the east.</P>
    <P>On the role of the board and board members, as things stand the brief of board members is far too wide. We are dealing with the concerns of 1.3 million people. Not only is the Eastern Health Board on average three times larger than any other health board but there is a high concentration of all the social problems in the east which makes the work of board members much more difficult. There is insufficient time to give the necessary attention to many of the issues because of the volume of work with which members are asked to deal.</P>
    <P>Many parts of Dublin have not had representation on the Eastern Health Board and are often overlooked. I welcome the proposal to improve the level of representation of people in the Dublin area. There is a tendency at official level to treat Dublin in the same way as Wicklow or Kildare, and that the three counties should be given the same level of representation. Dublin is 11 times bigger than Wicklow so there should be 11 representatives from Dublin for every one from Wicklow on a health board. That is the only way to ensure the issues that affect Dublin people are properly represented and that they get a fair hearing. This has not been the case and I am glad it is being rectified in this Bill. Those are the principles on which I support the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, in practice the Bill is fundamentally flawed because of the manner in which it has been decided to constitute the membership of the area boards and the regional authority. The logical way forward is to ensure proper representation at area board level so that each of the three area boards has the full range of representation enjoyed by all other health boards. This would mean they would have representation from the full range of public representatives, GPs, consultants and other professionals. That is not going to happen. The representation will be inadequate because, for some reason, it was decided to start with a 55 member regional authority. The mind boggles when one thinks of 55 people in a boardroom trying to do business. Because this regional body will provide the membership for the three area boards, these boards will have inadequate representation on a number of fronts. This is a fundamental flaw in the Bill and the Labour Party will table amendments to correct this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> We should start with full representation at area board level and each board should have two or three representatives at regional level. In practice, this will mean professions such as general nurses, psychiatric nurses, pharmacists, dental representatives and so on will be represented on only one board in the eastern area. As a result, there will be two health boards without a representative of those professions. This is unworkable and the Minister will rue the decision to go forward on this basis. I have been in touch with a number of professional organisations and they are very annoyed at being squeezed out of the three new health boards. The Minister will hear many complaints from those bodies in the coming weeks. This is a fundamental problem with the structure proposed by the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have seven years' experience as a member of the Eastern Health Board and two years as Chair. The board's remit is too big and unwieldy and there is not enough time to give adequate attention to many of the issues which arise. However, what is being proposed is that, in place of the existing board, we will have a 55 person board with two and a half times the existing budget. The staff will also increase by 250 per cent. A brief which was already too wide and onerous will be substantially increased. Being a member of this new authority will be the equivalent of a full-time job if it is to be done properly.</P>
    <P>I expressed my concerns to the Minister on this issue some months ago and he stated that the legislation would be couched in terms which would prevent any operational matters being dealt with at regional level. It is impossible to preclude members from engaging in operational matters at regional level. That will not work. For example, the dental representative will be on only one board. Therefore, the only forum at which that person can raise issues relating to dental services is at regional level.</P>
    <P>It is in the nature of public representatives and local councillors to go to the top if they do not get satisfaction at area level. This means they will try to raise local concerns at regional level. The regional board which should be a small, tight, strategic body will be bogged down in operational matters with far too wide a brief. I appeal to the Minister to examine the manner in which the area boards and the regional authority are constituted. Rather than starting at regional level, he should start at area level and appoint representatives to the regional board.</P>
    <P>I am pleased multiannual service plans will be provided by all agencies, including the area boards. This is a progressive development. It is also important that we ring-fence funding for services provided to people outside the eastern region in cases where specialities exist in eastern hospitals. The new eastern authority should not be landed with the expense of providing those services. It is important that this distinction is made.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the task force on the work it has done. It has put an extraordinary amount of time <Col N="882" /> and effort into developing these proposals and meeting staff at all levels and senior management. This has made the process smooth and workable. I have spoken to many members of the task force about my reservations. Most accepted my reservations and agreed it would have been better to start at area board level. However, the task force's brief precluded it from such considerations. In the interests of ensuring that these proposals work, that services in the eastern region are improved, more responsive to the consumer and more efficient, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his approach and to put forward new proposals on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to reform organisational structures in the health services in the Eastern Health Board region and to improve co-ordination and integration in the planning and delivery of those services. Improving co-ordination and integration is to be welcomed and is always in the best interests of those who avail of the services.</P>
      <P>In his Second Stage speech, the Minister stated the need for radical structural reform in the health services. This has been recognised for some time in the eastern region. As Minister for Health in 1989, it was you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who announced this proposal about the eastern regional health authority. That was a long time ago and much has changed since. At that time there were many groups working in the Eastern Health Board area, some with vested interests, providing a level of service to meet the needs in their sphere of interest. I congratulate the Eastern Health Board on the manner in which it recognised the need for change and entered into partnerships with other sectors who provide services in the region. There is now a common understanding of what is required concerning funding. Because this happened in the last decade, I am not sure whether the announcement made in 1989 still stands.</P>
      <P>Much water has passed under the bridge since the initial move with regard to a new health authority for the eastern region. However, I acknowledge that society has changed dramatically since the Eastern Health Board was established in 1970. The population of the region has grown from under 1 million to in excess of 1.3 million. As a contemporary society, individual expectations have changed.</P>
      <P>The challenges facing our health services are greater than ever &ndash; drug misuse, AIDS, HIV, family breakdown and homelessness. These are dramatic changes in the complexity of issues which must be addressed given the demise of the extended family support structure and the knock-on effect for the elderly, children and vulnerable people in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of providing health and personal social services to the people of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow last year was £1.2 billion. A total of 27,000 people were employed in the delivery of <Col N="883" /> services. The Eastern Health Board accounted for £6.8 million of the £1.2 billion total expenditure. This included the cost of running the GMS and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. A total of £542 million went directly to the voluntary sector. The Eastern Health Board employs 9,000 people compared to the 18,000 people employed in the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board and the voluntary sector are funded directly and independently by the Department of Health and Children. This dual funding makes it difficult to maximise health and social gain in the region. There has been concern for some time that the structures which served the region well in the 1970s and 1980s are inadequate and inappropriate to meet the enormous challenges of health and personal social services facing it in the first decades of the new millennium. It is appropriate that preparations are made to meet those challenges.</P>
    <P>Various reports commissioned to examine the future needs of the region all recommended change. However, I am not sure whether I concur with all the recommendations. The task force drawn together to consider this matter comprised people with health board experience and representatives of the Department of Health and Children, the voluntary sector and private enterprise. The task force called for and received submissions from a wide range of interested parties and the members also brought their own experience and expertise to bear. I made a detailed submission as chairman of the Eastern Health Board in 1991. However, that is over eight years ago and I am not sure that I could stand over every item in the submission.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a number of fundamental changes. The Eastern Health Board will be dissolved and replaced by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. This new authority will be responsible for strategic planning and negotiating funding for the region with the Department of Health and Children. The authority will be responsible for the commission of new services, but not the delivery of them. Services will be delivered by three new area health boards which will be established in the region. In addition, the voluntary sector, which traditionally has been funded directly by the Department of Health and Children, will now receive its funding along with the area health boards from the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    <P>The boards will be known as the North Area Health Board, the South-Western Area Health Board and the East Coast Area Health Board. Undoubtedly, they will enjoy the benefits of a smaller geographical area and a correspondingly smaller population. Each board will be in a position to identify the needs and priorities in its area. This will enable the boards to plan services and allocate budgets accordingly. The decision making process should be brought closer to the people and as a result the boards should be in a position to respond to local needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> Under the new arrangement, the service plans will be the key to creating a co-ordinated and integrated service between the area health boards and the voluntary sector. There will be contracts between the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the area health boards and the voluntary agencies. It will define the agreed level of services to be provided for a specific financial allocation. All these services will be rolled up into one overall regional service plan which the authority will submit to the Department of Health and Children. This will enable everybody to know who is providing particular services, what is expected of them and how much they must spend on a yearly basis.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether that is much different from what the Eastern Health Board did for 1998 and this year. It submitted its service plan and everybody knew what would be provided in terms of services and how much was required. Following the introduction of new accounting procedures in 1998, first charges will be imposed on any overruns in 1999.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the proposed changes is to deliver a better quality service to the people of the region. It is to ensure that the money expended on the provision of services is spent in the most effective manner and that there is value for money. Undoubtedly, this is a good sound bite. The issue is whether it will work and if we know what ingredients are necessary to make it work. I am unsure, but I recognise that it is an opportunity to bring about the most significant reform of the health services in almost 25 years. It is a chance to empower staff with the ability to make a difference in the quality of service delivered. This challenge can ultimately deliver a better service and provide more rewarding jobs for all those involved in the delivery of services.</P>
    <P>However, I have reservations. I am not convinced all this will happen as a result of the introduction of the Bill. The Minister used the example of a geriatric patient to illustrate the type of improvement he hopes the reorganisation will bring about. However, it does not require the Bill to effectively provide the service the Minister said the patient required. The same elderly lady referred by her general practitioner to an acute hospital may require step down convalescent care, domiciliary support and attendance at a day hospital. These services can be provided by the Eastern Health Board. However, there can be delays.</P>
    <P>The acute hospital may not be in a position to accommodate the patient on referral due to blocked beds and discharge the patient due to lack of availability in the required step down convalescent care. It is a vicious circle. Another example is the case of a stroke victim. The hospital occupational therapist acknowledges the need for support appliances in the home. Although the patient is not meant to be discharged, she and many thousands like her are sent home while the support appliances are not in place. The patient must wait for the community <Col N="885" /> care occupational therapist to call and inspect the physical structure of the home before the support appliances can be provided. This is extremely frustrating.</P>
    <P>These cases involve elderly people in hospital who undergo the rigours of medical attention and rehabilitation. It is identified that a patient needs certain support appliances and the family is advised accordingly. The patient goes through an assessment in the hospital and his or her needs are identified prior to discharge. The bed is needed within a couple of days and the patient is discharged into the care of his or her family. However, no support appliances have been put in place. One asks why that is the case because the needs of the patient have been identified by the hospital's occupational therapist. However, the community care personnel must examine the physical structure of the home. The appliances cannot be put in place until the physical structure is examined.  One can understand why this is necessary in certain circumstances. However, I am not sure that it should apply to a simple commode which would be of enormous benefit to the individual and to those who are caring for him or her and which should be in place before they are discharged. I disagree that a community occupational therapist should be involved and that there should be a wait of a considerable length before a commode can be put in place. In such cases the vicious circle goes for another little spin, and before the community occupational therapist arrives the person is back in hospital.</P>
    <P>Since it was set up in the early 1970s the Eastern Health Board has covered the area comprising Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow where the population is growing and the demand for services is increasing. I pay tribute to my colleagues on the Eastern Health Board and to former board members, particularly the management team with whom I have worked closely. Former chief executive officers, Kieran Hickey and P. J. Fitzpatrick, were outstanding in their field. The current chief executive officer, Pat McLoughlin, has proved himself as a programme manager in a very difficult area, taking over the reins of the Eastern Health Board in an enthusiastic and determined style. I pay tribute also to his management team, Martin Gallagher, Maureen Wyndall, Séamus O'Brien, Bríd Clarke and Michael Walsh and the support staff and others employed in the Eastern Health Board. Perhaps only those of us who are involved at board level understand the commitment of those involved in the delivery of the Eastern Health Board's services.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of its mission of health and social gain for all the people of the area, the board has placed considerable emphasis on prevention and support services and has been engaged in identifying and addressing barriers to the achievement of full health and well-being by individuals, their families and the local community. To achieve that, the Eastern Health Board has focused on generating a sense of ownership and responsibility for personal health and well-being among <Col N="886" /> the community. The board has also worked hard to ensure that there is accessible treatment and care of the highest standard and at the most appropriate level available for all who need it. The board believes that clients and patients are entitled to receive an individual service delivered in an effective, efficient, courteous and user-friendly manner. The board has also developed constructive partnerships with voluntary agencies, local community groups and social partnerships, and these partnerships specifically target those most at risk of poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>One of my achievements as chairman of the Eastern Health Board, of which I am very proud, is the setting up of a customer services department at Dr. Steeven's Hospital which supports the needs of those it serves in a customer friendly way. It deals with over 100,000 telephone callers, via its freefone service, and 28,000 personal callers.</P>
    <P>In the area of children's services, the Eastern Health Board's policy on child welfare and health involves an integrated approach which looks at all aspects affecting the well-being of the young. Its aim is to support families so that children can live with their families. This approach involves measures to support vulnerable families and to prevent family breakdown. These preventative and family support measures include the community mothers scheme for which I have tremendous admiration and which involves experienced mothers providing help and assistance to first-time mothers, neighbourhood youth projects for children of eight years and over who have dropped out of school and who need support and help to manage their lives in family resource centres which provide counselling for families.</P>
    <P>In the area of mental handicap the Eastern Health Board and voluntary organisations in the field now provide residential services for approximately 2,500 people with learning disabilities. They also provide just over 7,000 day places. Major funding, both capital and revenue, is provided to the voluntary organisations for the development of residential and community facilities in line with the board's overall plan. Since the establishment of the Eastern Health Board, the board has reorganised its services for persons with a mental illness from an institutionalised to a community service.</P>
    <P>In the area of drug services there are currently 3,565 drug misusers being treated in my area. Drug services and community services have a very wide and detailed programme. Since the 1970s there has been a shift away from the provision of centralised medical services in hospitals and ongoing development of health and social services in the community. The Eastern Health Board has opened a network of new state-of-the-art primary care centres around its region where public health nurses work across the community, particularly in relation to child health and the care of the elderly. The board provides public health and environmental health services in the area of food hygiene, food standards and edu<Col N="887" /> cational support to all those involved. We also have a very active and lucrative property section which has proved to be of substantial benefit to the Eastern Health Board in maximising its assets and in the further development and provision of its services.</P>
    <P>There is so much I could say about the Eastern Health Board and the good it has achieved. There is an old saying about whether it is necessary to fix something when it is not broken. I believe the Eastern Health Board is not broken. It has come on in leaps and bounds. It has created the partnerships about which I spoke that were not in place when this Bill was originally mooted.</P>
    <P>The difficulties currently being experienced in the Tallaght Hospital baffle me. The planning of that hospital was a long time in the pipeline. I am disappointed given that that hospital was built at enormous expense to the taxpayer the hospital authorities came back, prior to its doors being opened, to request an extension to the accident and emergency department, despite the expert advice and opinion that was available from the Department. Here we have a Bill that was mooted in the late 1980s being introduced to deal with the 21st century. I ask the Minister to take on board the developments within the Eastern Health Board and model the new structures being proposed on the success of the Eastern Health Board to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is long overdue, and I hope it delivers a more efficient health service to the people of Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare. There has been a consensus for some time that the Eastern Health Board with the ever-increasing population it serves needs restructuring. In addition, the range of issues that the health board encounters has changed greatly in the past decade as our society opens up and addresses difficulties that have lain hidden in the dark corridors. Coupled with this movement to exposure, our increasing wealth has brought with it many of the problems that a less affluent society would not have to face. It is to be hoped that the new structures will be such that problems and tasks can be approached in a more efficient and economic manner and that the new organisation will give the lead to change in the other health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new health authority will be responsible for some of the most deprived areas in the country and, contrary to a generally held perception, there are large tracts of poverty in the greater south-east area. It is interesting to note that if Wicklow, Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford had been included in the Structural Funds application instead of Kerry and Clare, GDP as a percentage of EU average would have decreased from 73.3 per cent to 72 per cent. These counties are contiguous and I fail to comprehend how this indisputable fact squares with the claim that we have <Col N="888" /> tried to maximise Ireland's receipts. In addition, this area covers a larger population. The concept of the affluent east should not blind us in terms of the many social needs that must be addressed in an area of rapid population growth. As society evolves, so should our laws and structures. The Bill is a welcome development in that it seeks to address the many areas outlined in the Minister's speech. It is a positive step to decentralise decision making, especially in the area of health where many people do not currently understand the funding and operation of the service.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the health service is viewed as such, not as a monolith whereby people feel that they have been lucky enough to receive treatment and are under a compliment. The most dedicated and caring members of our population work or assist in the provision of health care and their commitment never ceases to amaze me, yet the mental picture conjured up at the mention of the words &ldquo;health service&rdquo; is far from positive.</P>
    <P>Many reasons may be put forward for this and we, as a profession, must take our share of the blame. It is an area where much political capital can be made as one can play on people's fears. The Minister adopted this approach in the past and now he is very often the recipient of the same medicine. We should move away from this approach and concentrate our energies on examining an area that receives much funding but about which a great deal of dissatisfaction is expressed. There are many groups central to the health service, among them consultants and the pharmaceutical industry. We routinely receive their periodicals and they outline strong cases. It is difficult to explain to a woman who experiences a certain level of constant pain that it will be a long time before she can have an operation. I am hopeful that a more efficient service will put an end to this.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that a new body will be charged with health promotion. This area has been neglected in the past and, indeed, this House and its associated work practices are not a great advertisement for a healthy lifestyle. The Minister also alluded to the imaginary elderly patient who moves through several strands of care and the hoped for positive experience of this patient will be one of the key criteria by which the service will be judged. I hope that this test holds firm. Deputy Callely believed this to be the case currently but I am not sure that he is correct.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings about a major change in the funding arrangements for voluntary hospital and agencies in the eastern region. However, they will retain operational autonomy while being fully accountable for the public funds that they receive. Developing any new health structure can be difficult and this is epitomised by the Tallaght project. Hopefully, some pertinent lessons have been learned. Establishing a bond between the statutory and voluntary sectors that will benefit the patient is the task that awaits the new authority. Change and its management is always difficult. I wish the new authority well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> The Minister has not decided where the various administrative headquarters will be located, but I understand that Bray Urban District Council made a submission requesting the siting of the east coast authority in Bray. The Minister spoke about bringing the health service closer to the general public. Perhaps, when he decides on locations for these centres, he will establish them closer to people and give them the impression that the service is nearby. Patrick Kavanagh in his poem, <i>Epic</i>, wrote about a disturbance in Monaghan during the Second World War and a man &ldquo;who owned that half a rood of rock, a no-man's land&rdquo; . He compared it to Munich and was trying to equate the fact that the dispute in Monaghan was similar to that in central Europe.</P>
    <P>The dental service for school children is causing concern in my constituency as there is a difficulty filling a vacancy for a dentist. I hope the Minister of State and his officials can address that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill which will establish the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I wish to be associated with Deputy Callely's remarks about the Eastern Health Board and the great strides that have been made in terms of providing services. More and more demands are made on our health boards and medical services. There are new and emerging needs and health board staff often deal with marginalised people. I have been particularly struck through recent contacts by people who are trying to establish drug clinics on behalf of the health board in my constituency. They are faced with great difficulties in attempting to do so but are making great efforts in terms of consultation in order to develop these services.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with the setting up of a new structure to deal with the huge population in the eastern health board region. Putting such a structure in place at administrative level raises many questions. The idea is that at the end of the day there will be a better delivery of services at local level, better local accountability and people will receive the medical and community services they need. However, making the move from an authority such as the Eastern Health Board to a new regional authority covering three different health board areas will be challenging and demanding. For example, organisations dealing with disabilities have attempted to amalgamate and set up new structures and it appears to be a procedure fraught with difficulty for staff. It is important that supports, including the necessary management training, are provided to staff. The authority will be challenging and enterprising but it will be demanding if it is to work effectively and fulfil the objectives outlined by the Minister when he presented the case for reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties of providing more specialist services which are not always easily available locally must be dealt with. We are moving towards more specialised centres, yet we are talking about more local access. There are inherent <Col N="890" /> contradictions, which I have experienced in my constituency where three hospitals have closed over recent months because of the Tallaght project. On one hand, we need a project such as that in Tallaght because it has the size to provide a range of services while, on the other, we want to make sure that people have access to a range of services locally.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic population increase in the inner city, yet medical services have been moved. There are no proper emergency services for children in the south inner city and families must travel too far. This must be dealt with by one of the new authorities when they are established. I call on the Minister to look again at the Meath Hospital, which currently provides some excellent local services. It is essential that the hospital is bought by one of the new authorities in the coming months so that the Minister will have the opportunity to provide the services needed in that area. For example, 18 per cent of children in Dublin 8 are under the age of 15, which is twice the EHB average. We must look at access to medical and emergency services for children in the area.</P>
    <P>This area also has the largest number of elderly people in Ireland. If the new health authority is to provide local and effective services, these issues will have to be taken into account. It is also interesting at a time when we are trying to make services more accessible to consumers that my constituency, Dublin South-East, will come under two different health boards under the new arrangements. People on one side of the street will be under one health authority while those on the other side will liaise with a different one. The point to be made is the importance of information to consumers.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more emphasis on consumers in the Bill and more mechanisms built into it for conducting research, for linking and forming partnerships with local communities and for liaising with voluntary organisations. While I welcome recent changes, the medical service has been incredibly slow in taking account of consumers' voices. An example would be my experience of working with the National Childbirth Trust. There have been changes in maternity hospitals over the past few years whereby these groups are now welcomed into hospitals and are provided with services and rooms where they can meet and talk with women about breast feeding and provide them with the information they need on maternity services. I would like to see some amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage to put greater onus on the authority to have more direct contact with consumers and also perhaps more representation on the board. It would be worthwhile and, if the provision of health services is to be seen as a partnership and if a partnership approach towards it is to be adopted, that would be an important aspect.</P>
    <P>This is an exciting Bill in terms of the potential of the service agreements. Perhaps the Minister could give more information on those when he is <Col N="891" /> responding, specifically how they will be prepared and monitored, how the Minister sees them working and how they will be evaluated. That would be helpful because it is a relatively new concept in the health services. It has been tried elsewhere but has led to difficulties. Perhaps the Minister could address that issue when he responds.</P>
    <P>The task of the new Eastern Regional Health Authority is a wide one. It will have responsibility for planning, commissioning and overseeing all health and personal social services in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow, including general hospital services and mental handicap provision. It will be responsible for the funding of those services in the region, for facilitating the integrated planning of those services and for ensuring there is better integration and co-ordination of service delivery. While the improvements made in these areas must be acknowledged, we still have a long way to go. The recent discussions on waiting lists, the need for more community care services and better services for carers all illustrate the huge gaps in services provided at local level.</P>
    <P>The area in which the greatest gaps occur is the level of service provided to those caring in the home. One example is a young family with a seriously handicapped child. Looking in detail at the range of services provided to the parents, there is no doubt that services are weighted more towards residential care than towards providing sufficient supports at community level for parents to provide the care they want at home. They do not receive sufficient support when they care for physically or mentally handicapped children full-time in the home. That is an area which must be examined. It involves developing OT and home help services and providing physical aids.</P>
    <P>There must be a database of the needs of the physically handicapped which does not exist at present. In delegating functions to the authority, the Minister should ensure the development of a database on the needs of the physically handicapped is a priority. I am not aware of one being in existence at present. We do not have the statistics and, without them, services cannot be improved or a proper service plan worked out. It is important the authority bases as much of its work on research. It has been underrated by the health service and we need to learn the lessons from research in providing the best services. Research has a great deal to teach us and we should focus on that.</P>
    <P>I hope the authorities will have a strong role in the health promotion area, an area which lacks support. Considering the disturbing research published about young women and smoking, the huge pressure they experience from advertising, the focus of international companies on them and the health consequences for them, it can be seen that health promotion is an area to which funding should be given. It should also receive support in terms of individuals working in the area. Smoking is just one obvious example of many areas where a great deal more could be done. Sport is another <Col N="892" /> area and, while it may seem far removed from what we are debating today, it has strong links in terms of promoting a healthy lifestyle.</P>
    <P>The authority will have a wide range of functions. It will have to make arrangements with service providers, and this should involve monitoring and evaluation of services. There should be more consumer representatives on the board of the authority. I accept the point the Minister made in his speech that public representatives will be on the board, but the membership should be re-examined. I am not sure the nine voluntary representatives envisaged at present is adequate representation.</P>
    <P>It is important consumer feedback on how the new services are operating is obtained quickly. It is also important before that is done that comprehensive information on the changes is provided to people. The public often feel removed from the service providers. A strong information campaign should be mounted so that people are aware of the new authorities, where they are working, the areas they cover and their responsibilities, and that there is plenty of scope for the public to have their input and to contact the authorities to submit their ideas and voice their concerns.</P>
    <P>Community care services will need to receive much more support than they have in the past. One of the major challenges for the new authority is to develop further community services, especially for the vulnerable groups I have mentioned. The domiciliary care services clearly need to be built up more. I worked as a social worker in London 20 years ago and I remember the community care services available at the time for elderly people living on their own as being incredibly good. I do not believe we have yet reached that level here. We have a long way to go in terms of supporting elderly people who choose to live at home but who need strong support. Many people unnecessarily end up in hospital, long-term care or convalescent homes because they are still not given the supports they need.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which is a first step on a long and possibly difficult journey. There are many aspects of the legislation which will need ongoing monitoring and evaluation.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille agus go háirithe roimh an ath-struchtúrú atá á dhéanamh ar an mbord. In the 30 years since it was founded, the Eastern Health Board has outgrown itself. The population has increased by 41 per cent to a staggering 1.3 million and its budget is almost £1,000 per person at £1.2 billion. It is an opportune time to restructure the Eastern Health Board, which at this stage is up to six times larger than the other health boards. It has become difficult to offer the range of services for combating problems in the city and county of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the health board was set up, the problems of the elderly, children's health and public health promotion were the main issues, but there <Col N="893" /> are now added problems of child and drug abuse and homelessness. There should be locally based structures to handle some of them. In the context of local government there are now three county councils for which a new management structure was needed. The management structure proposed in the Bill will ensure the involvement of local communities, councillors and voluntary organisations to ensure a good service is provided.</P>
    <P>The new health authority will identify the needs of the eastern region as well as commission, oversee and evaluate services. I look forward to planning and co-ordination in each area health board. The involvement of voluntary hospitals is welcome. I understand this will be based on partnership. Their role and that of voluntary organisations should continue to be recognised. The Order of St. John of God provides services for the mentally handicapped. There is a need for greater co-operation and to ensure the bodies concerned are represented on the board in conjunction with the others mentioned.</P>
    <P>The new structure should envisage locally based services in a number of areas. Breast cancer is of particular concern to me. About 1,500 new cases are diagnosed each year. About half of these will ultimately die. One in 12 will contract breast cancer, the most common malignancy among European women. An excellent service is provided in St. Vincent's Hospital where a complete service is offered each Friday. It should be replicated in each of the new area health boards. There should be a specialist breast clinic offering the services of a breast surgeon, a medical and radiation oncologist as well as clinical examinations, mammography, cytology and histology services. Every woman diagnosed with breast cancer should have access to a breast care nurse. Funding should be made available for the provision of these services.</P>
    <P>The national breast cancer screening programme due to be introduced later this year is well planned. A total of 120,000 women between the ages of 50 and 64 are to be targeted for screening. The necessary follow-up services should be provided in each health board. Groups such as Europa Donna which was established recently are heightening awareness of breast cancer and pressing for the provision of locally based services.</P>
    <P>The increase in drug abuse, particularly in Dublin city and county, and the role of the Eastern Health Board in providing drug centres is of concern. While health boards cannot win, I fault the Eastern Health Board for the lack of consultation with local communities. It was planned to provide three clinics in my constituency, one of which never got off the ground because local residents formed a chain across the road to block people entering. They also superglued the shutters. If the Eastern Health Board had sought to reach agreement and formulate a plan with local community leaders and local politicians, the problem could have been avoided. Where such centres are provided the board should comply with the <Col N="894" /> agreement reached with the local community in terms of opening hours and the numbers attending.</P>
    <P>Monitoring committees should continue to work with interested parties and where problems arise they should not be allowed to falter as happened in Dún Laoghaire. To avoid problems everybody should work together. It should be understood that clinics are provided for the good of the community. The fears of local communities need to be allayed and confidence built up.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has issued a ten year action plan for the elderly. There are many nursing homes in my constituency. I am concerned that some of these are moving away from providing long-term care towards convalescent care. This obviates the need for round-the-clock nursing care. Fewer staff are required and there is a greater turnover. The area health boards should work with nursing home providers to ensure much needed places are provided. The necessary back-up facilities are not available in the community to allow the elderly remain in their homes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the eligibility criteria for medical cards for the elderly. This means they will now have more comfort in dealing with doctors and chemists.</P>
    <P>One would regard Dún Laoghaire pier as a place where people go for a walk and to enjoy the sea. A sad sight is young homeless people sleeping on the pier. Those without a home in Dún Laoghaire are referred to hostels run by the health board in town. They are alien to people from Dún Laoghaire who do not know where they are going. They are not suitable for young mothers with children. Locally based hostels should be provided under the new structure.</P>
    <P>Many of the homeless in my constituency are young mothers with children who must leave bed and breakfast establishments by 9 a.m. and not return before 6 p.m. There are no facilities available to prepare food for themselves and their children, not even a lunch box. Will the Minister consider funding a day centre for the homeless in Dún Laoghaire and in the other area health boards to ensure the health and safety of the people concerned? </P>
    <P>There is another group for whom no one takes responsibility. They are not elderly but may be homeless because of psychiatric problems. The council does not want to deal with them because they have a psychiatric problem. The health boards do not deal with them because they are not old enough. The voluntary organisations do not want to deal with them because they have a myriad of other problems also.</P>
    <P>I know of one particularly sad case of a young man who is sleeping in the park in Cabinteely. He has psychiatric problems and he now has developed drugs problems, but nobody will take responsibility for him. Following the break-up of the Eastern Health Board, I hope we can have a more locally focused service so that the various organisations will work together to ensure <Col N="895" /> nobody falls through the net, we can provide a service, we can identify and respond to people's needs, and we can plan and co-ordinate for the good of each area. Dealing with 1.3 million people has become too unwieldy. It is beyond the power of the existing board. I hope the new structure will ensure that together we can work locally for the good of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which has been on the drawing board for some considerable time. In fact, it was mooted on several occasions in the distant past when I was a member of the Eastern Health Board. I am amazed it has taken so long to reach fruition.</P>
      <P>I have my doubts about the beneficial impact of the proposal outlined in the Bill. I worry that a greater emphasis is being placed on the structure to be put in place to provide a service rather than identifying the need to provide an efficient, fast and direct service to the consumer. I am not sure that the proposal will not raise a refined form of bureaucracy in a specific geographic area, drawing on its past for its inspiration. We may have learned many beneficial lessons from the past, but the times have changed dramatically. The public expects a much more dramatic response than they were used to getting in the past.</P>
      <P>After all these years it is amazing that there is an attempt to revert to the old Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow health authorities. The Eastern Health Board has given extremely good service to a large and varied population, including people living in a wide variety of terrain, over a period of time. The Eastern Health Board currently caters for approximately one third of the population. This requires the delivery of services in more rural areas, in terrain to which it is not as simple to deliver services as it is in a city or town. However, the board did reasonably well in that regard.</P>
      <P>The problem I see arising in the future relates to how quickly and efficiently the health services, irrespective of their constituted form, respond to the public need. My one criticism of health services is that they appear to be run almost as a business. The problem is that one cannot run them as a business. It does not work that way simply because people do not become ill on cue. They become ill through no fault of their own and they require services in line with their illness at the time they become ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health services, like the educational services, affect every family and person in the community at one time or another. In many cases, they affect people many times. Therefore, the constitution outlined in the Bill needs to look at how effective this will be in the more efficient delivery of the services to the consumer and recognise that the consumer is vulnerable. It is not as if the person is able to go to a particular location to order something and say that he or <Col N="896" /> she will be back for it in a month. The service is required at a specific time but the consumer or patient may have to wait a great deal of time before delivery. Therein lies the big contradiction. This is the one area in which we cannot afford a delay in the delivery of service. While on the one hand great emphasis is placed on costs and the best return on investment, we should also recognise that the people to whom the services are being delivered have an urgent need. It is not something which can be postponed for a month, six weeks or a year.</P>
    <P>I hope that the hospital services and the direct services to the public will be more readily available. I do not know that that will be the case because I have no reason to believe that the proposed structure will be any different from that which exists. It will not be the case until somebody somewhere decides to take the whole thing on board and asks, &ldquo;If there are X number of people in need of a specific service at a given time, how fast can we deliver that service to them?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Demographic trends change and the needs change. As the population grows older, the needs of a particular group in society change. Anybody who becomes ill is vulnerable and uneasy about the future. An elderly person is no exception but I want to emphasis that his or her sense of vulnerability is accentuated.</P>
    <P>Strange things happen at present. For example, a specific group of people, who do not qualify for dental benefits through their social insurance contributions, are excluded from receiving benefits through the health boards because of the numbers which are coming on stream. This is totally illogical because it has no regard for the need of the patient. It only has regard for the logistics of the number of patients to be dealt with. That is grossly unfair. We should not automatically exclude a number of people, who could be women of child-bearing age, for example, who would be in need of dental treatment more urgently than many other people. Why should we go down that particular road? Will the Bill attempt to change that? It will not make a difference. It involves redrawing the map but I do not know if it will have a great impact on the delivery of the services. That is just one example.</P>
    <P>Let us look at another example of where we need to look carefully to the future. As I said earlier, the changing times involve many threats as well as benefits. Take epidemics in schools and school medical examinations, for example, and the need for a sharp, efficient delivery of services there. I compliment the health boards and the Eastern Health Board, in particular, for its work in that area over many years since 1970. There is no harm in pondering for a moment on the various illnesses which affect children and the rapid way in which an infection can become established. Meningitis is a case in point. The causes of that illness are obviously as prevalent now as they were in the past. Attendant upon that is the concern of the patient or, in the case of menin<Col N="897" /> gitis, the parents of the patient. The rapidity with which the services can identify the problem and respond to it is vital. Instant action must be taken and that involves making information available to parents, teachers and school authorities on the existence of an epidemic or the potential for an epidemic. There is a need to respond quickly and positively and to give clear information so that parents can have confidence in the services.</P>
    <P>Part of the difficulty of being ill is the concern on the part of patients or their relatives as to whether they can have confidence in the system. If they do not have confidence in the system, fear takes over and loss of life can occur also. The attendant problem of anxiety and fear is something the patient can do without at that stage. Patients must have confidence in the ability of the services to deliver in a rapid and effective manner.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to areas such as special hospital services and the care of those with physical or sensory disabilities. Will the new structure be more effective and efficient? Will it address the issues raised by successive Governments and health boards over many years such as long-stay and respite care for the elderly and those with physical or sensory disabilities? Will it examine the fine print in detail in terms of the efficient delivery of services to the people in that category, who are very vulnerable? They depend on those around them to care for them.</P>
    <P>We should examine the question of elderly people who rely on institutional care such as a private nursing home because there is a tendency on the part of health boards, having gone through the various assessment procedures, to determine if the person has a home they can sell or rent. Very often, because of the age of the person concerned, the house is in such a condition as to make it unsuitable for sale or rent. The health boards then tend to consider the possibility of the property being disposed of. That may be possible in some cases, depending on the bond that exists between the individual and the household, but what about people who are seriously ill or who require long-stay institutional care? They may find the only way they can afford the care they need is to sell the only possession they have remaining, their only tie with the past. It may adversely affect the health of such patients if they are confronted with the prospect of having to sell their homes. That is unfair and it should be possible to deal with the issue in another way. I know some health boards try to do that and alleviate such concern as much as possible, but this area must be carefully examined with a view to a sympathetic delivery of the services in so far as the needs of these people are concerned.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the homeless, an issue about which those of us living in the suburbs of Dublin are also concerned. The homeless question covers a very wide spectrum now, particularly given the scarcity of rentable accommodation throughout the greater Dublin area. It is quite common for young women with one or two <Col N="898" /> children seeking emergency accommodation to be sent to a hostel perhaps 20, 40 or 50 miles away. Three problems arise immediately. First, they are uneasy about travelling so far away; second, they have never been in that type of environment before; and, third, they are separated from their relatives and friends. It is not right to take people away from their local area where they have recourse to the support of friends and relatives, even if it is only psychological support.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this legislation will change that. It should bring about a greater concentration on the services throughout its jurisdiction, but I not sure that will happen. I have not seen anything put forward so far that would indicate to me that that will be the case.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all the lessons we have learned in the past, in general we have not responded to the health care and special housing needs of our population which should flow naturally from the demographic changes that have taken place. If we do not respond to them effectively it will result in a loss of confidence in the system and a potential danger to public health. I am not sure the package now emerging is more effective and capable of delivering better services than those which existed previously. I will say more about that later.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the efficient delivery and cost effectiveness of the health services and that they appear to be run as a business. As the age structure of our population changes, greater emphasis is required in certain areas. We can give much lip service to the way we should address this question, but I wonder if we have done anything in this area. For example, can we deliver emergency hospital services to a wide area of Dublin? Does that population have ready access to that service comparable to that which existed 25 years ago? Deputies will remember all the hospitals we had in this area 25 years ago which are now closed. Everybody said that big was beautiful and that we would get better service in large hospitals delivering to a wide region. I am not sure that thinking was right or that method effective. I am not sure we delivered a more efficient service to the population in those years.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will be of some benefit, not to the administrators but to the people to whom the service ought to be delivered. The key factor is the delivery of the service directly, quickly, sympathetically and efficiently to the people. If this is the core value of the health service we will have achieved something. In my years on health boards I have heard more reviews of every aspect of the health services than anyone in the House. I have seen many reports contradicted by subsequent reports and I now feel brave enough to put forward my own views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate. The Minister, the Minister of State and I have listened <Col N="899" /> carefully and I think there is agreement on all sides on the need for structural reform of the health services in the eastern region.</P>
      <P>The task force recommendations form the fundamentals of the Bill. I wish to deal with a number of issues raised by Deputies. Concern has been expressed about the role of voluntary hospitals within the new arrangements. Some Deputies alluded to the fears that a culture might develop in which the authority would favour health board hospitals over voluntary hospitals in the matter of funding. The task force report states:</P>
      <P>The authority must treat all service providers, statutory and voluntary, in exactly the same manner. There must never be a perception that one sector or another is receiving more favourable treatment. The structural arrangements must be such as to ensure that all providers operate on a level playing pitch.</P>
      <P>That makes clear that the recommendations are designed to ensure that all service providers will be treated equally from the beginning.</P>
      <P>The question of how the teaching responsibilities of major hospitals might be catered for under the new arrangements was raised. As proposed in the Bill, there will be a written agreement, to be renewed annually, between the authority and the hospitals which will specify the services provided by the hospital and the funds which will be made available for those services. In this context it will be possible to make the necessary arrangements for funding of such matters as teaching responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes it clear that the provisions in legislation which apply to health boards will also apply to the new authority. Therefore, the relationship between the new authority and the Department of Health and Children will be the same as exists between the Department and the health boards.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter mentioned information systems. I agree that adequate information systems for the new authority are vital. The development and implementation of information systems in anticipation of the establishment of the authority is being commissioned and is being phased in over a five year period. The significant cost involved in this major investment would have arisen in any event because of the need to improve information systems in the Eastern Health Board region. It has to be said that in the context of the annual budget for the region's health and personal social services of over £1.2 billion, the cost anticipated as a result of the proposals in the Bill are very reasonable, particularly when the expected service improvements and efficiencies which will result from the establishment of the new authority are taken into account.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have participated in the debate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 34 to 37.</P>
      <P>The amendments which have been grouped for the purposes of discussion propose to delete those sections of the Bill which contain references to ESAF. On every Stage of this Bill the members of my party and I have debated this issue and have explained to the Minister why we are dissatisfied with ESAF programmes. Two years ago the rainbow Government of which I was a member decided not to contribute to ESAF in response to widespread opposition throughout Ireland to such a contribution. The Debt and Development Coalition's opposition to ESAF was based on a number of factors including the negative social impact of ESAF because IMF aims to reduce deficits, not human misery or poverty in underdeveloped countries. There was also a feeling that ESAF strategies are imposed on democratic countries. They are designed by officials at IMF in Washington and frequently imposed on national states without due consultation with their elected leaders. The charge is made that they are anti-democratic. ESAF conditions are onerous and inappropriate and, according to the brief with which we have been supplied, about three quarters of ESAF programmes break down and do not reach fruition. ESAF was introduced as a response to the debt crisis but it has failed to tackle this problem. Having held out for a number of years against contributing to ESAF it is inappropriate to legislate to allow the Minister for Finance to contribute now, when ESAF programmes have demonstrably failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> The HIPC initiatives were heralded with a certain amount of optimism when they were introduced some years ago but their implementation is progressing very slowly. Only two countries, Bolivia and Uganda, have received debt relief and only three others, Guiana, Mozambique and Mali, are likely to benefit by the year 2000. Serious questions hang over the HIPC initiative now because eligibility for HIPC is linked to a six year track record on ESAF programmes. Given the high breakdown rate of ESAF programmes, the IMF is effectively preventing the application of the HIPC initiatives because, although they met with general approval, their implementation and application has been inhibited. Debt relief for Tanzania, one of Irish aid's longest standing partners, has been held up because of problems with ESAF. Relief for Nicaragua, one of the lowest income and heaviest indebted countries in the world, was held up because of problems with ESAF before Hurricane Mitch.</P>
    <P>I referred on Second and Committee Stages to the internal and external reviews of ESAF programmes. I have no information to suggest that since the reviews were carried out any real remedial action has been taken by the IMF in its application of ESAF programmes. The external review undertook case studies in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Bolivia, Vietnam and Bangladesh. The review criticises the IMF for failing to take the social impact of these programmes into account when designing them. It also criticises the IMF for mistakes in the design of these programmes.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on Committee Stage, in Malawi, huge price rises resulted in the halving of the real wages of agricultural workers, the most impoverished group in that country. In Côte d'Ivoire, urban informal sector workers faced huge losses as devaluation squeezed consumers' incomes. In Zambia, the wrong sequencing of reform led to a credit crunch in the private sector and delayed emergence of rural food markets when maize marketing was privatised. This destroyed the livelihood of maize producers in remote areas. In Zimbabwe, mistakes in the order in which policies were introduced led to reductions in <i>per capita</i> expenditure on health and education. Uganda is put forward by the IMF as the success story. Growth was restored and the economy stabilised, but the benefits of growth were found mainly in the urban areas, which contain only 10 per cent of the population. The lot of 90 per cent of the population, who live in rural areas, was not improved by the application of ESAF programmes.</P>
    <P>To borrow a phrase from the Minister, I am not a fundamentalist on these issues. A strong case has been made against ESAF. The Minister will lose the moral authority we have enjoyed as a nation because of our tradition and record on overseas aid if he agrees to contribute to the IMF without the necessary reform taking place.</P>
    <P>My fundamental objection to the ESAF programmes is that their application is removed and <Col N="902" /> they tend to apply macro-economic prescriptions to economies without regard to the basic services which should be enjoyed by a population in any humane society. Where macro-policies and proposals on fiscal rectitude are so intense that they risk increases in infant mortality, the closure of schools which provide basic education facilities to young children, reduce the life expectancy of the elderly and leave no resources available for public health programmes, such as immunisation programmes which could do wonders for increasing life expectancy in those countries, ESAF programmes are being applied too severely and too rigidly.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, we all appreciate that balance must be restored to economies that have gone out of kilter, but balance cannot be restored if there is a total disregard for the well-being of the indigenous population. An economy is not inanimate. Any nation is only the sum of its people. If the medicine is so severe that it kills the patient, then the programmes are not working. That is the fundamental problem with ESAF. When the Minister asked if there was a <i>via media</i>, I referred him to work that had been done which proposes that before ESAF applies its battery of economic and fiscal prescriptions, which consist of policies to deregulate, privatise, liberalise and retrench, that a certain amount of the national budget should be set aside for basic health and education schemes.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing that debt in a league table of countries should be cancelled, but when the World Bank and the IMF intervene to improve the basic economic structure of countries and the World Bank, in particular, applies development funds to a country, the basic human needs of the population should be taken into account in the first instance. If the wherewithal cannot be found to service outstanding debt after domestic resources are applied to basic health and education services, then there is no money to service the debt and at that point it should be waived. That is the <i>via media </i>which the Minister has been looking for. This is not an original proposal. I can refer the Minister to the documentation setting out how this has been carefully worked out.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows my party's position on this legislation, but because of the importance we attach to it and the strength of our opposition to ESAF programmes, I am tabling the amendments on this Stage that I tabled on Committee Stage. Amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, in the names of Deputy McDowell and myself, provide for the deletion of any reference to ESAF from the Bill. This will allow the Bill to go through without our contribution to the IMF going towards funding ESAF programmes contained in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan pointed out, the effect of amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, is to delete reference to ESAF. We have ranged over the debate at some length on Second and Committee Stages. The Minister's response requires reflection and demands comment from us. It seems his response does not stand up. The <Col N="903" /> Minister, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, published a lengthy and worthy statement last September highlighting principles which would guide our foreign policy on the debt initiative. They highlighted many of the deficiencies of ESAF programmes, which Deputy Noonan mentioned and which we dealt with earlier.</P>
      <P>They talked about difficulties of transparency, accountability and the effect of the programmes on the countries they were intended to assist. They also mentioned that these programmes are imposed on those countries which have no sense of ownership of the programmes they are obliged to implement. They stated that they often have a detrimental effect on civil society. They also stated that they took little or no account of the social effects of the economic criteria and measures which were being imposed on those countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, have accepted this and the Minister accepted this in the statement he published last September at the time of his annual visit to the IMF in Washington. The logic of this is that at the very least we should wait to see if there is progress in dealing with those principles the Minister set out last September. We are not unique in this.</P>
      <P>The IMF identified and accepted there are problems with ESAF programmes. They have not worked and most countries on whom they have been imposed &ndash; that is the right language to use &ndash; have been unable or unwilling to complete compliance with the programmes.</P>
      <P>The IMF undertook an external review on the manner in which the programmes are implemented and we dealt with this on Second Stage. The external review was damning in the prescription and recommendations it made. Following it, the staff of the IMF, who operate the programmes, carried out an internal audit on the recommendations and published a commentary on it, some of which they accepted and some of which they did not.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is simple, as of today very little progress has been made in implementing the recommendations of the external review and in giving real meaning to the principles set out by the Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs last September. As the Minister knows, in 1994 the previous Government decided it would not subscribe to ESAF programmes until such time as we were in a position to show progress. The Minister's own party, Fianna Fáil, prior to the last general election specifically undertook in its manifesto not to make any contribution to the ESAF programmes until there was reform.</P>

    <P>Reform has been promised and is there on paper but, as of now, it has not happened in any substantive way. Therefore, there is no argument <Col N="904" /> for a contribution to ESAF programmes at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fond of telling us to stop preaching and that we must get in there and argue our case. That suggests there is no alternative, but of course there is. We do not even have to look for a <i>via media</i>&ndash; we need to look at the actions of the Government itself.</P>
    <P>The Government has, quite properly, engaged in a direct bilateral initiative to assist the Government of Mozambique to cancel £7 million of debt, which is clearly the way to go. Why engage in funding an international institution that is deploying strategies of which we do not approve to do something when we can do it in a very direct bilateral way? We have a well established bilateral aid programme and we have established good relations with six or eight countries, including Tanzania and Mozambique, which have huge debt problems. There is nothing to prevent Ireland making what little contribution we choose to make on a direct bilateral basis rather than through the IMF.</P>
    <P>We also debated the case of Brazil. The Minister has very kindly circulated a note today on Brazil. The note is very comprehensive but it is faulty on one important point in regard to what the IMF fund for Brazil is intended for. It is intended to prevent the collapse of the international financial firmament, in which we all have an interest. </P>
    <P>How is this money actually to be used? It will be used to impose quite considerable public expenditure cuts in services in Brazil and to sustain the value of a currency which everyone accepted was overvalued. This is a classic IMF template. Without claiming any particular expertise on Brazil, I am deeply sceptical about this. We are all entitled to say, because it is glaringly obvious, that the international community can find billions of pounds for the eighth or ninth biggest economy in the world but we find it very difficult to persuade the international community to contribute a fraction of that &ndash; millions of pounds &ndash; to the cancellation of Third World debt.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister's mind is made up on this. I did not find his argumentation on Committee Stage persuasive. I would be surprised if he were prepared to consider it further now. This is not a good day's work. There are many better ways in which we could have contributed towards the cancellation of Third World debt.</P>

      <P>I contributed to this debate on Second Stage. I thought that, arising from that debate, the Minister might have had second thoughts on proceeding with the section of the Bill relating to ESAF. I thought that the backbenchers from his own party who spoke so passionately against this Bill could have persuaded him that this was the wrong policy to pursue. I thought that the aid organisations, which are very active in Ireland and in developing countries, which know the situation on the ground and have been campaigning vigorously against this <Col N="905" /> proposal to contribute to ESAF and to participate with the IMF in relation to it, might have persuaded the Minister to drop it.</P>
      <P>It appears all these pleas have fallen on deaf ears. The Minister will not listen to the cogent arguments about the damage the IMF has done through this programme to countries which Ireland has traditionally sought to assist. He will not listen to the case that the direct aid which Ireland has been giving to these countries is far more effective in alleviating poverty than the ESAF programme, which has made the problem of poverty in many countries even deeper than before it was applied.</P>
      <P>Why is that the case? There is no demand among the Irish public or his own backbenchers for this legislation. Why is the Minister pursuing it so vigorously and ignoring all the advice and pleadings he is hearing from all the Opposition parties in the House, some of his own backbenchers and the aid organisations, which do us so proud in developing countries?</P>
      <P>The only conclusion I can come to is that the Minister has a blind ideological commitment to the type of policy the IMF pursues. That seems to be the only credible answer.</P>
      <P>The IMF has not, despite the external review and the internal audit, committed itself to shifting dramatically its policy in relation to these countries. The IMF traditionally takes into account a country's debt, but it also takes into account its balance of payments and the degree to which it is fitting into the IMF view of how an economy ought to operate, which is based entirely on a view of how a developed country ought to operate. It does not take into account the degree of illiteracy, the degree of unemployment, the absence of clean and healthy water or the absence of a health service in a country, issues which have a bearing on the quality of life of the ordinary individual. The direct aid which we have traditionally given does so.</P>
      <P>It would have been far better had the Government not taken money from the direct aid budget and slotted it into this ESAF proposal. The net effect of what the Minister is proposing is not just the provision of this money to ESAF in order to participate in this scheme &ndash; he has actually robbed Peter to pay Paul. In doing so he is undermining the work of aid organisations which are delivering aid directly to people on the ground, in order to put it into a scheme which has been shown by an external examination and an internal audit to be counterproductive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us something other than that we should not preach. I look somewhat askew at that, bearing in mind the statement issued on 16 September 1998 on the Government's debt relief package, including Irish contributions to joint IMF/World Bank debt initiatives and ESAF, in which the Minister preached about the principles on which he feels the IMF and ESAF ought to be based. However, there is no evidence that the IMF is responding seriously to our appeals &ndash; I am not talking here <Col N="906" /> about a nice report and a nice proposal that it will do X or Y. We have not yet seen any desire on its part to implement any reforms in this scheme.</P>
    <P>I have referred previously to a RTE programme on Mozambique, in which an IMF spokesperson was asked directly why debt could not be written off in the developing countries. He replied that that would be a very nice idea and said he would talk to his bank manager about the possibility of writing off his mortgage. Two things arise out of that response. One is the total lack of understanding it displayed of the difference between the man's mortgage and capacity to pay it from his very large salary and the economic capacity of the ordinary people of Mozambique. Those people do not even have clean water to drink and 57 children under five years of age die every minute. For the man to have compared their situation with his ability to pay his mortgage was insulting to the people of the developing world. It is the kind of attitude which permeates the IMF and its approach to developing countries.</P>
    <P>The response also highlights the underlying ideology which drives the IMF, namely that if one takes out a loan to buy a car or a house or to build a bridge or a road, one is obliged to repay it. That may be acceptable in a democratic country in which there are fully developed resources, infrastructure and taxation systems but to seek to apply that ideology to debt in developing countries is to condemn the poor and newborn babies to death.</P>
    <P>Since this debate commenced at 6.15 p.m., something in the region of 4,000 children have died in the Third World. In the light of the above statistic, it is cruel and inhuman for the IMF to apply its criteria and not allow people to escape from the debt of their country. It is not a good thing for Ireland to align itself with that kind of approach to the developing world. I appeal to the Minister to accept the arguments which have been made by his own backbenchers, by all of the Opposition parties and by all of the aid organisations and to accept their appeal to drop this proposal to give money to the IMF which will have the effect of deepening the poverty of people in the Third World. Those people did not, in the first instance, have a say in how that money would be spent. In many cases, the money was not used for the purpose for which it was borrowed but went into private accounts in Switzerland. Yet, we are going to participate within the IMF in penalising the men, women and children of the developing world for some reason which the Minister has not yet explained, other than to say that we must stop preaching, get in and make our case. We can make our case through the European Union, at the United Nations or anywhere we choose but it is not necessary for us to provide money to the IMF which will only add to the misery of people in the developing world.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> It is shameful that the Minister and Government are persisting with <Col N="907" /> the provisions of the Bretton Woods Bill, 1998 in view of the debate which took place in this House and the compelling evidence placed before them by Members of the Dáil and through the many well researched submissions they received in recent weeks. It is shameful that the Minister will sit unmoved by the type of evidence which has been outlined in regard to the role of the IMF and the enhanced structural adjustment facility.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the IMF's role in poor countries is not as their champion or saviour but as a huge contributor to their oppression and suffering. The manner of its intervention reveals that the IMF represents, first and foremost, the interests of the western banks and industrial concerns. It exacts from the poor a huge price for any loans it provides. The IMF is insisting on the most savage cuts in public expenditure, namely in social, health and education spending, in a range of African countries. How can the Minister justify his continued approach to tie this State in with that heartless agency, therefore becoming part of the machinery of oppression of this part of the world?</P>
      <P>The Minister may be aware that the external debt of sub-Saharan Africa stands at approximately US $235 billion. More money is going out of Africa through debt servicing than is available to meet the basic needs of health, education, food, water, sanitation and so on. In the case of Zambia, the 1998 budget allocated more money to servicing the immense debt of US $7.1 billion than to all education and health programmes combined. The World Bank &ndash; the IMF's twin in regard to keeping the poor of the Third World in financial chains &ndash; published a report in 1996 which showed that debt service payments as a ratio of GDP stood at approximately 5 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. Against that, spending on health and education totalled only 2.5 per cent of GDP. The evidence is absolutely crushing.</P>
      <P>Loans were provided quite recklessly and immorally to dictatorships which mishandled them; they were not, by and large, given to democratic regimes or to organisations working towards the betterment of the poor. It is the poor who carry the burden of repayments and anyone in Ireland who wishes to take a stand against what is, at this stage, outright robbery of the poor of the Third World for the purposes of fattening the profits of banks in the western world through the agency of the IMF, must resist becoming part of the IMF and the ESAF. I join with the other Deputies in calling on the Minister to provide a rational explanation of his position, rather than one or two glib put-downs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The net effect of amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 would be the acceptance that the wrong institution is being assisted on the basis of the wrong analysis by the wrong method. That is the best way of summarising why using ESAF is wrong. There is a conflict between the IMF and other institutions involved in development. In the context of taking the north and south as broad thrusters of economy the IMF admitted, in publication No. 72 of 1997, that &ldquo;on average there has been no convergence of <i>per capita</i> income levels between the two groups of countries. In fact the number of low income countries and the lowest quintile in terms of global income distribution has actually risen from 52 in 1965 to 102 in 1995&rdquo;. The IMF publication describes these results as &ldquo;surprising&rdquo;. On the other hand the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in its second publication of 1997 stated: &ldquo;Capital has gained in comparison with labour and profit shares have risen everywhere&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister used the word &ldquo;preaching&rdquo; in a previous stage of the debate. I have been in many of the countries that must take decisions about adjusting their economies and I can tell the Minister that I heard much preaching, for example, in the case of Chile. The recipe was delivered to the Chilean economy by the Chicago School of Economics, locally called &ldquo;los mochachos Chicago&rdquo;. The Chicago School of Economics arrived and imposed on the Chilean economy a prescription with immense social consequences for the Chilean people. It concentrated on increasing a form of export earnings on a narrow range of products at the cost of huge reductions in the Chilean public services, including health care and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other countries when I visited were at a crisis in relation to the international institutions. For example, Peru bravely and briefly sought to put an upper limit on the proportion of gross domestic product that could be and should be morally paid by any country out of a year's earnings. Peru was not successful in this and, following a change of Government, was, as the institutions would put it, brought to heel. This tells us the recipe being advanced through ESAF is born out of an analysis which comes from a very narrow neo-liberal strain of economics which has a very different set of results in different parts of the world, whether one is looking at the recent crises in what were previously regarded as the tiger economies of south east Asia or economies with long histories of economic growth, such as Singapore. However one looks at it one can see cracks appearing in the analysis. Why has the Minister taken this instrument, which is acknowledged as flawed by its own analysis in its own institution, and why has he chosen this institution which is already in crisis in terms of its prescriptions for different economies? There are other institutions with which we may not agree but which exist. I mentioned the trade <Col N="909" /> organisation which is reaching conclusions regarding what happens when there are adjustments which are not tested in terms of their social impact. For example, is it right to have an instrument from this very dubious base applied without considering the consequences for health care, education and sustainable development?</P>
    <P>People say the ESAF instrument was not acceptable before an internal analysis took place, but that the internal analysis has now taken place. This is like saying we have opened the windows but have not made any change. Where are the changes to which the Minister can point? Where are the points of correspondence between the critique of this instrument, conducted within the IMF, and the critiques conducted by the other international agencies? When we look at our relationship with development through our bilateral programme, emergency disaster relief, overseas development aid and payment to institutions, we must ask the Minister by what reasoning he arrived at a conclusion that things have changed so much in the past two years that he can recommend to the Houses of the Oireachtas that we change policy and agree to make a contribution towards ESAF? The Minister owes us an explanation.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat cynical, as from the mid 1970s to the 1990s the terms of trade of the least developed countries who would use the facility fell by just over 50 per cent. Is there no obligation to take account of factors such as this? Deputy De Rossa also mentioned that the social context is being ignored by ESAF as a blunt instrument. There are 15 million children working in bondage in India alone. There is police and prison violence in Brazil and Venezuela. If the Minister tells us that addressing issues such as this is preaching, I would prefer him to openly say that things like degrading conditions of employment, child slavery and bondage and the export of huge amounts of GDP when there are great needs in countries has nothing to do with economics. I suspect this mindset, namely, that real economics is about the neo-liberal agenda and the kind of Chicago recipe which has driven the IMF, is brought to bare in relation to this matter. Saying so may be compared to a tiny elite of yobos going to a football match and defining the game.</P>
    <P>Far from preaching, those of us who have been to the countries where the work of Irish agencies is being carried out are giving witness to the consequences of IMF policies. We are simply saying we are unimpressed by the window dressing of the internal review and are absolutely unimpressed by the logic which is driving this revision in policy which is in favour of making a contribution to ESAF. There is nothing wrong with our analysis as we are linking an economic prescription to social policy. What kind of impoverished intellectual thinking suggests that financial measures, including relieving bank debt, can be taken out of an economic or social context?</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Minister to say there is need for a greater development debate, for a <Col N="910" /> review, through a debate, of our relationship to the different international institutions and our obligations and that he will examine ESAF in this context. Nothing will be lost by doing this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment Deputies Naughten and Shatter for bringing forward this legislation. It is worthy legislation which addresses an issue of great concern to the public. I also take this opportunity to give my full support to the Minister's decision to accept this Bill in principle. This is a constructive approach and one which is welcomed by all Members in this House.</P>
      <P>Ticket touts are a regular feature at matches and concerts. They exploit fans and concert goers in a selfish attempt to line their own pockets. Touts who operate outside sports grounds and concert venues seem to do so with immunity. The introduction of anti-touting legislation will provide an opportunity to clamp down on this activity. At this stage in the debate, however, it is important to realise that clamping down on ticket sellers outside venues is only part of the solution to prevent touting.</P>
      <P>While legislation enabling the gardaí to arrest and confiscate ticket touts is necessary, we should realise that the ticket touting network goes beyond the point of sale, and efforts must be made to cut down on the number of tickets available on the black market. The prime responsibility in this area lies with major sporting organisations and other legitimate ticket sellers. Greater efforts must be made to implement tracking systems for tickets so the relevant authorities can find out exactly how tickets are getting into the hands of touts on the black market.</P>
      <P>One of the main deficiencies with this Bill is that it seems to place on the gardaí all responsibility for dealing with ticket touts. This emphasis is wrong. The ticket dispensing organisations also have key role in this process and must be required to play an active part in limiting the number of tickets available on the free market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the section which makes it an offence to publish advertisements for the sale of tickets in excess of their face value. This has become a regular occurrence and a casual perusal <Col N="911" /> of small advertisement columns in the newspapers in the run up to any major sporting event or music concert will demonstrate that this is a vehicle often used by ticket touts to sell their wares. What is also evident from such advertisements is that a minority of ordinary punters who may have spare tickets to an event are not slow to avail of this avenue to make a quick buck. It is important this is stamped out because it lends to the legitimacy of ticket touting if ordinary punters begin to dabble in this trade in an attempt to line their own pockets. When this Bill reaches Committee Stage it will be important that we manage to strike the right balance between cracking down on the illegal sale of tickets above face value and the normal barter and exchange which happens between fans around large sporting events.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of seeing the Kildare football team make it to the All-Ireland final this year and am only too aware of the ticket frenzy which takes hold when tickets are in short supply and demand is high. Often a genuine fan may have spare tickets on the day of a match, and although I cannot speak as an expert on the music industry, I am sure the same applies to pop concerts. It is important that we do not criminalise the legitimate exchange of tickets between fans and supporters. In any ticket touting legislation, we must be clear who the real targets of the law should be and establish safeguards to protect legitimate punters who engage in the usual barter and exchange of tickets in the run up to large sporting events. I support the legislation and hope to speak on it further at the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for sharing his time, especially given the year that was in it when Kildare got to the All-Ireland final. I support and congratulate Deputy Naughten on bringing in this Bill and on his success in persuading the Government to accept it. On 13 November 1990 I published the Sale of Tickets Bill. I would certainly not accuse Deputy Naughten of industrial or legislative espionage but it was very similar. What is different is that the Minister on this occasion is permitting the advance of this legislation to Committee Stage, which is a welcome change. I just read the coverage of the Bill I introduced on 13 November 1990 when the then Minister with responsibility for sport, Deputy Fahey &ndash; some people are extremely fortunate in the duration of time for which they are Ministers as Deputy Fahey is still happily with us &ndash; said such a measure would be unworkable and impossible to enforce and voted it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an unimportant measure. The victims of ticket touts are usually the genuine sports fans who come from constituencies like my own and who do not have the type of money ticket touts demand on the day, whether for an All-Ireland final, a soccer international, a Triple Crown game or, indeed, a concert. The ticket touts know there is a market and a certain type of punter who will be there on the day to pay whatever the price &ndash;<Col N="912" /> the sale price multiplied by whatever factor. It disadvantages the ordinary sporting fan who has followed his or her team around for years.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Wall in that it is not only a question of responsibility being put on the Garda, and I look forward to Committee Stage when I will have the opportunity to contribute. The dispensing authorities have a responsibility, and we have seen that in a fairly spectacular way in recent times when they have not lived up to their responsibility. I congratulate Deputy Naughten and the Minister for agreeing to allow the legislation to advance to the next Stage. Ticket touting is an important reforming measure which other countries have introduced. Ticket touting is an anti-social activity and people are profiteering from the goodwill of genuine sports and concert fans and it is time we dealt with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of Deputy Naughten and other Deputies about the activities of ticket touts and commend the Deputy on bringing this Bill forward. Ticket touting is a very unattractive feature of our society and, as Deputies and the Minister said, is carried on openly on our streets prior to major sporting and cultural events. Paying the type of prices for a match ticket which Deputy Naughten quoted last night is very foolish and those who support ticket touts by paying such inflated prices must play their part in bringing this unsavoury practice to an end.</P>
      <P>The demand for tickets for certain events will always exceed supply. There is simply no way around this where, for example, major sporting events are concerned. The example of the Ireland-England rugby match at the weekend is a good one. I agree with Deputy Naughten who said that every year thousands of sports and music fans are disappointed when they are unable to obtain tickets for such events. What can we do where demand greatly exceeds supply? What can be attempted, and what this Bill seeks to do, is to put arrangements in place to ensure that the available tickets go to genuine fans who must not be denied access to major events because of the operation of ticket touts. This is a noble aspiration and I commend Deputy Naughten for it. It remains to be seen whether it will be possible to devise feasible measures to achieve this objective because, as my colleague, the Minister, said last night, the Bill, as drafted, poses many practical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I, like my colleague, the Minister, come into this House in a positive frame of mind. I listened carefully to what the Minister said last <Col N="913" /> night about there being times when, as politicians, we must say we will try to deal with the issue but it would be remiss of me if I did not refer to the possible difficulties. I also listened carefully to what Deputy Rabbitte said about a similar Bill he proposed. There is no doubt that legal and official advice will say we cannot do many things but it is important to deal with it as best we can.</P>
    <P>Foremost among those difficulties is the question of enforcement. I am sure Deputy Naughten and Deputy Shatter would agree that it would be pointless to enact legislation which was unenforceable and clearly known to be so. It would bring the law and the Oireachtas into disrepute if ticket touting was seen to continue in defiance of the expressed will of the Oireachtas. There is a danger that the Bill drafted by the Deputy could, albeit unintentionally, have that effect. One can imagine the difficulties facing the gardaí trying to monitor the myriad number of deals being conducted in dozens of pubs before, for example, an All-Ireland final to say nothing of the wheeling and dealing by telephone, fax and, no doubt, e-mail which goes on in the frantic weeks before a big game.</P>
    <P>I understand why the enforcement provisions were adapted as they were. Full Garda powers, including powers of arrest, would be required if there were to be any prospect of effective enforcement. The danger is that the use of such powers may be regarded as over kill by the public. Careful consideration will have to be given to the enforcement issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In discussing this Bill we should not give the impression that legislation is the only answer to this problem and the Deputy is not suggesting that. I agree with Deputies who referred to the responsibilities of organisers and promoters of major events, such as football matches and concerts, to regulate ticket sales. This is one area which needs to be tackled. Deputy Naughten has pointed out that many sporting organisations support this Bill and while that support is welcome, these organisations might look at their distribution arrangements rather than relying on this House to resolve a difficulty to which their actions may be contributing.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs my interest is in ensuring that legislation protects the consumer in his or her dealings with traders and professionals. Much of this legislation is designed to allow the consumer to make an informed choice about a product or service. False or misleading advertising, labelling or price indication is prohibited by the Consumer Information Act, 1978, supplemented by the European Communities (Misleading Advertising) Regulations, 1988. The legislation ensures that the consumer is armed with sufficient information about a product or service, including the price.</P>
    <P>It is normally considered a matter for each consumer to decide whether he is prepared to pay over the odds for a product or service. Prices are most effectively restrained by competition, so much so that price control was effectively aban<Col N="914" /> doned ten years ago. It could be argued that this Bill would reintroduce a form of price control. However, I accept that this situation is unusual in that competition cannot effectively operate where there is such an imbalance between supply and demand.</P>
    <P>I applaud the objective of the Bill but the means of achieving that objective will be our primary focus on Committee Stage. This will not be a simple task but that does not mean we should not try to deal with the matter. In the meantime, event organisers must play their part in ensuring that their distribution arrangements are such that genuine fans have access to tickets to our major sporting, cultural and entertainment events at a reasonable price and that ticket touts are removed from the distribution chain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputies Shatter and Naughten on this legislation and commend the Minister for agreeing with its general tenor. I cannot recall getting a ticket to a match by any means other than a most circuitous route, whether by haggling in the Royal Dublin Hotel, talking to friends or bartering a ticket for a Manchester United match for a ticket to the Wales-Ireland game. However, this is a serious matter and the measures proposed are important.</P>
      <P>Four advertisements appear in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, three of which appear correct but one reads: &ldquo;Wanted Rugby, Ireland Vs England, Seats or Standing, Discretion assured-Ireland Pickup&rdquo;. This is the kind of ticket touting which is reprehensible as these people are obviously charging over the odds.</P>
      <P>On 3 February <i>The Irish Times</i> noted that tickets for Saturday's rugby match were selling for as much as £600. What will prices be by this weekend? This issue needs to be dealt with. I agree with the letter in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which challenges the paper and suggests &ldquo;perhaps your advertising people make a distinction between the sheepskin coat brigade and the humble spiv?&rdquo;  There is a clear distinction between people who sell flowers or sweets outside Croke Park and who have a few tickets to spare, no matter how they get them, and those who trade in this area.</P>
      <P>In recent years I have been waging war against credit card companies and booking agents who have the abominable practice of charging a credit card fee and a transaction fee. When presenting &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, Marian Finucane did a great deal of good work in countering this practice and consumer affairs officials have curbed it to some extent. However, there is an advertisement in one of today's newspapers run by a chain of cinemas and there is a 60p credit card charge. Many theatres also adopt this practice which is not in the spirit of good consumer legislation. I can see why a transaction fee is charged but I do not understand why a ticket fee is attached to such transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A booking agency showed me how complicated this procedure was. It produced boxes of counter<Col N="915" /> foils from all over the country and claimed that this was a labour intensive process. However, surely these people are not trying to cod us all into thinking that this is credible. Whatever amendments are being considered by the Minister, he should look at ways of curbing the attachment of fees to credit card bookings and ticket prices for theatres.</P>
    <P>There are issues to be addressed. Sporting organisations need to examine the risk posed to the public by allowing tickets to be issued indiscriminately whereby people can obtain tickets for hostile parts of a football ground. This poses a public order threat. Unfortunately, we had instances of this in Dublin and it has happened regularly abroad. This is good legislation and we have to try to ensure that the consumer and the bona fide sports follower can access tickets without having to go through a convoluted, underground distribution system. I commend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill. I compliment Deputy Naughten on its introduction and the Minister for accepting the main thrust of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte must have been supporting Cork in 1990 when he introduced his Bill on 13 November 1990 after the famous Cork double in hurling and football. It was almost impossible to get tickets for those games, particularly the football final, and some people paid £500 or £600 for a pair of tickets.</P>
      <P>There is a long way to go on Committee Stage. However, we must examine where those who stand on street corners or who place advertisements in the newspapers get their tickets. I am familiar with the GAA and all of these tickets are distributed through its organisation. Sporting organisations have a great deal to answer for. It cannot be that difficult to implement a checking system whereby if someone pays over the odds for a ticket he can go back to the organisation and have the situation checked. There is a need for greater scrutiny. The difficulty in enforcing the Bill is that the Garda, apart from policing traffic and crowds at big sporting occasions, would have to check out what is happening in pubs. However, if people could get their hands on all-Ireland tickets ten years ago, one can be sure they will get them for the 1999 all-Ireland football and hurling finals in which undoubtedly Cork will participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most speakers mentioned sporting occasions but tickets for cultural and musical events can also be scarce. People telephone friends, relations and anybody they think might have tickets. It has been said that a seat in the Seanad could be assured of if one had regular access to tickets. The Bill can be amended and implemented, but sporting organisations and promoters who distribute tickets must be made more accountable. A system must be introduced where if a person distributes five tickets for a sporting organisation and it can be shown they were not sold at face <Col N="916" /> value, he or she can be held accountable. If a person cannot offer a logical explanation, he or she must answer for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is timely. It provides an opportunity to discuss the issue of ticket touting. When one comes from Cork, supporting one's hurling and football teams is an expensive business. Up to recently, we had to travel to Croke Park on many occasions to support the players. It is disappointing to get off the train in Dublin and see touts openly selling tickets for all-Ireland matches under the shadow of Croke Park. This is very upsetting for genuine fans at home who spend weeks following the teams and watching league matches in the dark winter months and who cannot get tickets for the glorious occasions. There are technical difficulties with the Bill but the Minister must take on board its spirit and thrust. He should introduce whatever amendments are necessary to ensure the Bill is effective.</P>
      <P>The problem of ticket touting at sporting and cultural events is huge. It has been known for tickets for the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis to be put on the black market and to make substantial sums. The problem does not only affect sporting events but also cultural events. The Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis could be described as a sporting, cultural and political event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of security must be addressed, particularly with regard to certain sports. There is a move towards pay for viewing and genuine fans will be unable to watch games for free. People who are loyal to clubs and watch games on television because they cannot travel to matches will be forced into the black market. The area of segregation and security must be considered. Unfortunately, there were ugly scenes at a stadium in Ireland in the past. Unless there is a clamp down on ticket touting, there will be serious security problems in the future.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to take on board the thrust of the Bill and to consider where it can be amended to ensure it is technically correct and can be enforced. The House has passed legislation in the past which was difficult to enforce. Organisations have a moral duty to ensure that tickets distributed from their headquarters reach genuine fans. Touts must be getting tickets from organisations initially and the bodies have a duty to address this problem. The Bill should include a provision which would discourage organisations from allowing tickets to get into the hands of touts. I am sure the Minister will consider the Bill favourably and adjust it to make it more efficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill and I acknowledge Deputy Naughten's initiative in bringing it before the House. I compliment the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, <Col N="917" /> Deputy McDaid, on his reaction to it. He welcomed the thrust of the Bill. It is also important to note that the Bill is accepted on all sides. This rarely happens and it shows that issues can be resolved sensibly and quickly when politicians are prepared to work together.</P>
      <P>At last people have become used to free time which they use to enjoy themselves. The country's economic prosperity has ensured that young and old people are able to share in the delight of sporting and musical events. It is important that regular sports enthusiasts have a fair chance of getting tickets for events. It is also important that they can share in the delight of matches safely and comfortably.</P>
      <P>Too often we have seen the distress caused by the difficulty in securing tickets for the all-Ireland final. Usually this distress is suffered by long standing fans who have huge difficulty securing tickets for all-Ireland finals. The continued success of sporting events depends on the availability of tickets for regular, long standing fans. Ticket touts deprive people of enjoyment of their favourite sport.</P>
      <P>The Bill is timely. It appears touting has been around forever, but it has taken on a life of its own in the past ten to 15 years. Organisations and promoters must move to ensure that tickets are distributed fairly. Systems must be improved to prevent touts getting what they claim is their market share. While it will be impossible to totally eliminate touts, all initiatives to curtail their activities should be supported.</P>
      <P>Section 3 proposes that powers should be given to the Garda to arrest a person where the member of the force has reasonable cause to believe the person is committing or has committed an offence. I accept that everything possible should be done to eradicate touting. However, I have reservations about expecting the Garda to deal with the problem. If the Garda are involved, it might reduce the responsibility of the organisers of events. Organisers and promoters profit from events and they must invest in ensuring that touts are eliminated.</P>
      <P>I am from a public house background and it has taken years to eliminate the involvement of the Garda in visiting local licensed premises. Publicans will agree that if they have to depend on the Garda to control and patrol their premises, it creates the impression that he or she is unfit to run the premises. When an application for a new licence is made, it is noted if the Garda have made regular calls to the premises. If the Garda is given powers in this area, a similar difficulty could occur in the future. I fully support the Bill. Touting is greed at its worst. The unscrupulous activities of touts have serious implications <i>vis-à-vis</i> security the segregation of fans and so on. This is a measure we all welcome. I compliment Deputy Naughten on introducing it and the Minister for accepting it.</P>

      <P>I have privately congratulated Deputy Naughten. I am happy to publicly con<Col N="918" /> gratulate him heartily on his success in having the Private Members' Prohibition of Ticket Touts Bill, 1998 brought before us tonight. I also acknowledge the spirit in which the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, agreed to accept the Bill.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Minister's contribution last night that while some aspects of the Bill before us are inadequate, these can be satisfactorily resolved on Committee Stage. This is an issue I have constantly raised over the years. Even though ticket touting is carried out openly in our streets prior to all major public events, when I began to raise the issue in this House by way of parliamentary question, I was sent from one Department to another. Eventually I forced the issue on a parliamentary question in March 1998. My question related to what procedures, if any, were in place to prevent the sale of tickets for concerts, football matches and so on, at a cost above their face value and the reply was that there was no basis in consumer law for prohibiting the sale of tickets above their face value and accordingly no procedures existed for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Pat Rabbitte's contribution when he attempted to address the issue in 1990. I gather from what he said that he was advised that regulation or legislation would be unworkable. We all agree in principle that something has to be done but that it will be difficult to come up with the right mechanism to address what we all want addressed.</P>
      <P>Genuine young, innocent fans are victims of abusing touts who publicly use very opportunity to squeeze the last penny out of them, even in relation to charity events to support the most worthy causes. I issued a press release in February 1998 expressing my shock and horror at the abuse by ticket touts with regard to a forthcoming Spice Girls concert in support of Childline. If ever there was an abuse of people wishing to see their favourite group and support the very worthy cause of Childline it was the abuse that occurred on that occasion. That is what prompted me to issue the press release in which I stated that whether with regard to rock concerts, festivals or sporting events, these greedy touts must be stopped and that the exploitation of our young people by these heartless touts was unforgivable. I went on to say that the sale of tickets at more than face value is wrong, that it not only puts increased pressure on parents but, in the case of the Childline benefit concert at the Point Theatre, these touts pocketed money that should have gone to children in need. I urged the promoters who stage events to cater for the huge public demand by scheduling extra dates for fans who would otherwise be disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to see there is unanimity in this House to try to address the problem. We will probably run into some difficulties on Committee Stage that will require a reasonable and pragmatic approach. Given the commitment that was evident last night and is evident again tonight, I <Col N="919" /> ask that we go forward in that spirit to adequately deal with the matter in whatever way is required.</P>
    <P>One other issue that needs to be looked at on Committee Stage is the booking fee of £2.50 charged by stores and sales offices and the credit card fee issue. I do not mind somebody charging a nominal fee for taking a large, possibly awkward, booking, but it is a bit rich that concert ticket issuers should charge an additional £2.50 simply to book a concert ticket. It may appear relatively insignificant compared to the price of a ticket, but if somebody is booking five or six tickets that additional cost amounts to quite a good deal. My fear is that the touts or sales offices will try to get around whatever we put in place. I ask that we look at this as best we can.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Government accepts this Bill. I compliment Deputy Naughten for bringing it before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>A tout is somebody who gets tickets and makes money from them. How do these touts get the tickets in the first place? One cannot get a ticket for an all-Ireland match but outside Croke Park, or Lansdowne Road there are people selling tickets. Somebody within the sporting organisations is handing out tickets. I cannot understand why the rugby and soccer associations and the GAA did not do what the Football Association in England did. If 100,000 people attend a match at Wembley Stadium the Football Association can identify all the tickets. If a ticket tout sells a ticket at £100 over the odds, that ticket can be traced back to the person who got it from the association. Why can we not do that here? It is because nobody has the courage to do it. There is a fear in many of the organisations that the people handing out the tickets will be found out. Those people are bigger touts than the touts on Lansdowne Road or Jones's Road selling hundreds of tickets on match days while the genuine supporter cannot get a ticket.</P>
      <P>Another problem is that one can go to the Connacht finals or the Leinster finals and get into the games, but when it comes to an all-Ireland final the corporate people, the people with the money, the people with the boxes are more important than the poor devil on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad this Bill has come before the Dáil. It should have been introduced 20 years ago. Ticket touts should not be allowed to sell a ticket above face value. The GAA, the soccer and rugby associations should be able to account for any tickets they issue, and if tickets get into the hands of a tout, the people responsible should be dealt with. For too long genuine supporters have had to pay above the odds to these people. What is to be done about the people who hand these tickets out to the touts? The sporting organisations and <Col N="920" /> concert organisers will have to take some responsibility. This Bill is a move in the right direction. I am delighted the Government is accepting it. I hope that when the legislation comes before the Dáil we can deal with both problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Naughten on bringing this Bill before the House and thank the Government for accepting it in principle. It is good that we all agree on something. It is probably the first time since I became a Member of the House that everybody has been in agreement.</P>
      <P>Ticket touts must be controlled. When this Bill is passed it will be a criminal offence to advertise or sell tickets for musical, sporting or theatrical events for more than the face value of that ticket. Currently, there are a number of unacceptable touting practices. Touts sell tickets for big events on the streets and the price is determined by supply and demand. If the event happens to be one which many people want to attend, the price rockets. People who can afford it often pay huge sums for tickets. Last week people paid £600 for tickets to attend this weekend's rugby international. I am frightened to think about the prices being paid this week.</P>
      <P>The ordinary man on the street cannot afford to buy these tickets and in many cases he is a more genuine fan. People should not be able to obtain tickets just because they can afford to pay huge sums for them. It is up to us to legislate to ensure that genuine fans have access to tickets. However, touting is not confined to the sale of tickets on the streets. Sports clubs sell their tickets allocation for big matches and they should be held accountable. Tickets for rugby and soccer internationals and all-Ireland finals should not used by sports clubs to raise funds. It may be unpopular but if we are serious about ensuring that all tickets are sold at face value to genuine fans, we must clamp down on all forms of touting.</P>
      <P>An Irish rugby club sold its entire allocation of tickets for next Saturday's rugby international to an English company. It is bad enough to sell tickets for profit but selling them to the opposition is even worse. These tickets should have been allocated to genuine Irish fans but, instead, they have been sold to an English company which has paid over the odds and that is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The IRFU, the FAI and the GAA have attempted to stamp out blatant ticket touting using various means to trace ticket numbers and punishing those who sell their tickets by cutting future allocations. However, it has not worked. If, as legislators, we decide that ticket touting is an unacceptable practice we must legislate to ensure that it is stopped. It has been done in other countries. For example, during the recent World Cup the French Government made the sale of tickets above face value a criminal offence and visitors caught touting were deported and refused entry into the country until the tournament was over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> If we are serious, touts must be taken on but we cannot hand over total responsibility to the Garda. Selling tickets above face value must be made illegal. The only exception should apply to charities or community organisations which have been given tickets to sell to raise funds. This is provided for in the Bill. Under it a ticket tout is liable to a prison term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding £1000. A garda can arrest a suspect if he has reasonable cause to believe the individual has touted tickets and he can confiscate tickets in the individual's possession. On Committee Stage, we must decide how this can be policed properly and organisations such as the FAI, IRFU and the GAA need to work in tandem with the Garda to stamp out ticket touting because it is not possible for the Garda to police the entire country with regard to ticket touting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Bill has been accepted. The Government previously accepted a Bill initiated by Deputy Shatter but it is a unique achievement for Deputy Naughten, who is the youngest Member of the House, to have this honour bestowed on him. I compliment the Minister on his maturity in accepting the Bill and if it needs to be refined on Committee Stage, so be it. If good ideas are promoted by the Opposition, the Government should have the maturity on occasion to accept them.</P>
      <P>This issue never manifests itself more forcefully to an individual than when his team is in the all-Ireland final. We, in Limerick, have had the unfortunate experience of losing two finals in recent years. I was in Dublin during the weekend of both finals and I witnessed the sheer frustration of young supporters and club activists who could not get tickets. As a public representative, I was inevitably approached and asked for spare tickets but I did not have extra tickets. Many of those people watched the match on television in Dublin but as I approached Croke Park ticket touts openly displayed tickets for sale above face value. One wonders how they obtained them. There are obviously channels open to them and those who pass tickets to touts make a profit; hence, the inflated prices.</P>
      <P>However, I have attended matches at Anfield, the home of Liverpool Football Club, in England, and ticket touts are not to be seen. There are rigid controls on ticket touting at football matches. We should introduce legislation to counteract the abuses to which big sporting and entertainment events lend themselves. Young people pay inflated prices to attend concerts. The Bill is timely and the debate has focused on the success of the Irish international rugby team. However, the respectable face of ticket touting was highlighted in last Sunday's newspapers. Agencies had bought tickets for this weekend's international rugby match and sold them at excessive prices to corporate clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will be a success, if implemented. It is right that we root out this problem that has existed for years and has almost become an <Col N="922" /> acceptable feature of big occasions. I congratulate both Deputies on introducing the Bill and I hope its improvement will continue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of my colleagues hail from counties where people do not have as much difficulty obtaining tickets for sporting events as Cork people. When Deputy Naughten has difficulty getting tickets to see Roscommon playing in an all-Ireland football final, then we will know that times have changed. I congratulate Deputies Naughten and Shatter for introducing this legislation and compliment the Minister for accepting it in principle. I am sure there will be a lengthy, but productive, debate on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is ambitious legislation because, until such time as Croke Park can hold 150,000 people or Landsdowne Road can hold 100,000, ticket touting will be a difficulty given that demand will always exceed supply. People are willing to purchase tickets regardless of the price. It has been a problem in Ireland for years. My first experience of it came at the centenary all-Ireland hurling final in 1984 between Cork and Offaly in Thurles. The word was out that tickets were not available, but, as it transpired, the ticket touts suffered a disastrous financial loss because tickets were sold for less than face value. Generally the touts have won but, I hope, as a result of this legislation the position will be reversed and order will be brought to bear on this chaos.</P>
      <P>The legislation must be workable and the Garda will have a big role to play in that. I look forward to the Minister's observations on Garda intervention and deployment. Traceability of tickets is absolutely crucial and there has been greater success in Great Britain on that issue. A number of well known sporting figures were highly embarrassed there when it was brought to public attention that they had sold tickets which ended up in the black market. That situation has never happened here. Surely it must be possible in this era of computerisation for sporting organisations, especially the GAA, FAI and the IRFU, to account for the whereabouts of tickets. It would be much more difficult for touts to operate if full traceability were in place. Such an obligation must be placed on the major sporting organisations and concert promoters. Were that to happen, the legislation introduced by Deputy Naughten could work. We are all aware of people paying over the odds to attend a sporting occasion or concert of their choice. Supply and demand can never be ignored but it is improper and, to a certain degree, immoral that people should pay £500 to £600 for tickets with a face value of £20 or £30. I hope the legislation will lead to the problem being dealt with successfully.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputies Naughten and Shatter on introducing the Bill. I thank the Minister for accepting it and hope there will be a mature debate on Committee Stage leading to a regularising of the situation.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputies Naughten and Shatter on the introduction of the Bill, which was published some months ago. It has received support not just in the House but also from major sporting organisations. There have been few examples in the Dáil of legislation or a resolution receiving such huge support from the organisational base.</P>
      <P>It is poignant and right that the youngest Member, Deputy Naughten, has managed to successfully steer the legislation through Second Stage. An issue which repeatedly comes to our attention as public representatives is people under 25 being hassled, if I may use that unparliamentary word, by the inflation of ticket prices for concerts by promoters and the difficulties they encounter in obtaining concert tickets. In that context, it is right that Deputy Naughten should introduce the legislation and successfully steer it through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and the Minister of State should be congratulated. For once the Government has not listened to the expert constitutional advice of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. On every occasion legislation comes before the Dáil in Private Members' time, the Department marches in with expert advice, which means the legislation does not progress beyond Second Stage. I am delighted the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, contrary to the expert advice I am sure was given by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have in this case stood up for the interests of people who want to attend sporting and cultural events. It is an excellent use of Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>The work of Young Fine Gael, the youth wing of our organisation, was central in the legislation in terms of petitions and support it received for it. It pinpoints the initiation of legislation which can occur when those in politics put their mind to it.</P>
      <P>Seán Kilfeather said in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 June on this issue:</P>
      <P>If members of the Dáil and Seanad . . . are serious about representing the people who elect them . . . the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill should go through &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When the legislation was first mooted by my colleagues, Deputies Shatter and Naughten, there was support from those interested in sport for it to progress to Committee Stage and be enacted. The Government has done the right thing to support the legislation. We should aim to have the Bill enacted by the time the rugby World Cup returns to these shores in autumn. In that way, the legislation will be an international flagship of reform of the law to eliminate touts. That should happen by autumn at the latest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent report by the ESRI pointed out the importance of sport and cultural life to Ireland. Those who emigrated ten to 15 years ago want to return, not just because of employment oppor<Col N="924" /> tunities but also because Ireland, Dublin in particular, has so much to offer. The quality of life in our capital city has been enhanced considerably as a result of major productions coming to Dublin and major sporting events being held here. That quality of life can be further enhanced if the city is marketed internationally to attract large-scale international musical productions and sporting events on a frequent basis. It is essential in that context that the standards in force for the sale of tickets for all major events are rigorously imposed. The Bill will make a difference to people who want to purchase tickets at reasonable prices for these events.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion last night about the Bill having to be substantially amended on Committee Stage. I do not believe it will, on the basis that, once touting is made a criminal offence and those engaged in it are liable to the prosecutions referred to in the Bill, although there is a possibility it will be driven underground, the on-site touting of tickets which is a feature of major international events, as will be seen this Saturday at the Ireland-England rugby game, will be eradicated overnight. By making touting a criminal offence, the sanctions proposed in the Bill will pose a huge disincentive to those engaged in the practice and will greatly assist in rooting out touting at sporting and other events.</P>
    <P>One of the issues which has been brought to my attention in my constituency is the discrimination between those who have credit cards and those who do not. If one has a credit card, one can book a ticket for a major musical, theatrical or sporting event without difficulty, whereas without it, one must queue up at a location where a certain proportion of tickets is being sold. That is sharp practice and should be investigated by the Director of Consumer Affairs. People who do not have credit cards are discriminated against and must queue on the streets for a small number of tickets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. It is good law and I congratulate Deputies Naughten and Shatter on initiating it.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputies Naughten and Shatter on the excellent work they have put into the Bill. It will not only offer the hope of a better way for those who attend major musical, sporting or theatrical events, but will also be of great joy to the hard pressed parents of teenagers. The unacceptable practice of touting is mean, exploitative, cheating and abusive. The cost of attendance at major events is expensive enough, and the Bill proposes to put an end to unnecessary extra expense. The idea of people buying great numbers of tickets to artificially inflate prices is nothing more than exploitation of the innocent. It is an abuse of those with limited access to tickets because of lack of funds and an inability to be first in the queue. This ripping off is not confined to the young, it extends to those on modest means, be they in golden years, strugg<Col N="925" /> ling to make ends meet or rearing a family on funds that will not stretch.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to accept the Bill. It is accepted that touts must be removed from the turnstile. We can now secure the ethos of a fair ticket for those who are fed up and disenchanted by the effects of the touting practise which is nothing more than highway robbery. The level of profit achieved by touts on a short-term investment is outrageous and would make even the chairman of the AIB or Bank of Ireland blush. This racketeering must stop. The ordinary match, theatre, concert or event goer must be protected from those who are nothing more than pimps living off the exploitation of others.</P>
      <P>Every parent of a teenager is well aware of the demands placed on them by their children. They can see only the ESB, gas, rent or mortgage bill. Where there are a number of teenagers making demands on modest means it can be a source of friction, irritation and anger when parents have to tell them they do not have the money to buy tickets on the first day of sale. When their resolve is broken and they scrape together the not inconsiderable price of a ticket or tickets, they are informed they have been sold out but that they can obtain them on the black market for a little more than face value.</P>
      <P>The House should put a stop to this exploitation and allow decent people to attend concerts, matches, music gigs and so on at the cover price set by the promoter to recover their costs and make a fair profit. These events should be given back to the people at a price they can afford. A stop should be put to this cheating and robbery by touts.</P>

      <P>The allocation of tickets for sports events and concerts has never been considered in detail. While blame can be apportioned to various organisations such as the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, members of the public often discard tickets, perhaps because of lack of interest, which unwittingly fall into the hands of the touts. It is, therefore, incumbent on the organisations concerned, given the level of profiteering, to closely monitor the sale of tickets through their outlets.</P>
      <P>Who are the touts and from where do they come? It is easy to say they are out to make a quick killing &ndash; this is not to legitimise their activities &ndash; but they do so out of need and necessity. In applying the law the many social ills in society must be eradicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem arises only when there is a major concert or international &ndash; next Saturday Ireland play England in Lansdowne Road &ndash; or at all-Ireland finals. People returning from abroad such <Col N="926" /> as the United States or Britain are willing to pay the exorbitant sums demanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Naughten and Shatter for providing the House with an opportunity to discuss this issue in detail. I commend the Deputies who contributed in such an informative way to the debate on an issue which preoccupies the minds of many and is of great concern and intense annoyance to them. The debate is timely as we approach the rugby international between Ireland and England at the weekend.</P>
      <P>The problems created by the touts are obvious, clear and straightforward. The solution, however, is much less simple, less straightforward and more complex when one comes to devising and implementing responses and systems to deal with the problem effectively.</P>
      <P>The Government supports the spirit and broad thrust of the Bill's objectives and agrees that it should proceed to Committee Stage when Deputies will be afforded an opportunity to consider its provisions in much greater detail and address areas of difficulty and concern. The Minister outlined a number of aspects which require careful and detailed consideration. There are a number of others.</P>
      <P>Section 2(1) would create an offence of extraordinary reach, applying as it would to every person, not just professional ticket touts, and to every place, not just public places. It would criminalise a young person who in his or her own home offers a ticket to a family member or friend for a price even fractionally over the face value. We can all think of examples where that transaction could occur for any number of reasons. To apply criminal law to such harmless bartering appears excessive.</P>
      <P>Section 2(2) would make it an offence for an unauthorised person to advertise for sale a ticket for a specified event at a price in excess of that officially designated on the ticket by the organiser or organisers of the event. This would apply to any person who publishes such an advertisement. It would apply to a newspaper or magazine which publishes an advertisement even where there is no reason to suspect the seller is unauthorised or the asking price is in excess of the designated price. In other words, it would be an offence of strict liability. I am not sure if that is what is intended, but the subsection would benefit from further consideration on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 3 would give the Garda Síochána disproportionate powers. If a person is seen passing tickets to friends and money exchanges hands, a garda would have reasonable cause for believing that person is committing an offence. He or she could follow the suspect home, force entry into the house, search the premises and arrest the person without a warrant. This cannot be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth mentioning that the general law on Garda powers of entry to effect an arrest, set out as recently as 1997 in the Criminal Law Act, con<Col N="927" /> tain strict limitations on entry to private dwellings.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the criminal law and the Garda Síochána in what is described by the explanatory memorandum as &ldquo;a new form of consumer protection&rdquo; is questionable and opens up a wide range of issues which need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that a Garda may arrest without warrant a person who is committing or has committed an offence under section 2(1), that is the offence of selling or offering or exposing for sale in any place a ticket for a specified event for a price in excess of the price officially designated on the ticket by the organiser or organisers of the event. It goes on to provide that a Garda may, for the purposes of making such an arrest, enter, if need be by force, and search any place where the Garda suspects the person to be.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this is an exceptionally severe power to apply, for example, to a youngster who had agreed to sell a ticket for a football match or a rock concert to, for example, a brother, sister or friend for even a pound over the face value of the ticket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>He might argue that he had some acquisition costs like travel, etc., to acquire the ticket in the first place and, indeed, might have had to spend 24 hours queuing outside the premises where the ticket was sold in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>No. As I indicated, I am just pointing out these matters to be helpful because all of these matters can be thrashed out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>During last night's debate on the Bill Deputy Broughan mentioned my Department's new Sports Capital Programme and his opinion that £50 million would be needed to meet demand. The Government has committed more than £50 million to the new programme over the next three years to help in the provision of high quality facilities for clubs and organisations throughout the country. This compares with £17 million spent over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Broughan's concern for disadvantaged communities. My constituency has many needs and concerns in this regard. Priority will be given in the allocation of funding under the new Sports Capital Programme to meeting the needs of disadvantaged areas. This is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to addressing the needs of these areas. The Deputy will be aware that a sum of £30 million has also been provided by the Government to the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund. This fund has been established for the purpose of <Col N="928" /> developing youth facilities, including sports facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas to involve young people at risk in positive, healthy and productive activities.</P>
    <P>The question of the sale of tickets by touts has raised many concerns among many ordinary decent people who simply want to attend a concert or sporting activity. It is time this House, through the auspices of the Bill, tackled the issue once and for all.</P>
    <P>There are examples in other countries, to which Members referred, where there has been a clampdown on the sale of tickets by touts. Consequently, we are making sure the exorbitant prices charged by touts become a thing of the past. The onus will be placed on organisers of events, whether sporting or leisure and recreational, to develop a system which will allow them to trace tickets which have become the subject of tout sales. Organisations involved in sporting and leisure activities must put in place structures to trace tickets which become the subject of sale by touts. We will send the clear message, through not only this legislation but by the manner in which organisations deal with the sale of tickets, that we, as a society, will no longer accept the position whereby tickets are sold at exorbitant prices to people who simply want to support a sporting, leisure or recreational facility.</P>
    <P>I commend those who brought forward the legislation. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and I look forward to dealing with this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Shatter.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Naughten and Deputy Shatter on bringing the Bill before the House. It is a positive initiative on their part. I know how difficult it is in Opposition to bring forward legislation. There are difficulties with research and with producing Bills. There should be a service available to all Members of the House who do not have the back-up of a Department to research and draw up Bills. This approach would enhance the democratic process.</P>
      <P>The current situation with regard to ticket touts, where they have a free reign, is totally unacceptable. Many of our European partners have recognised this and introduced controlling mechanisms to eliminate the practice. It is not fair that these people can get their hands on tickets for musical, sporting or theatrical events and line their pockets having ripped off the genuine fans who must pay well in excess of the face value of the ticket.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the initiative by Deputy Naughten, it is a disgrace that this issue has not been addressed heretofore. Sporting organisations have tried in vain to control the situation but have been singularly unsuccessful in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt this excellent legislation is necessary to control what is happening to ensure that tickets are available to genuine fans, those who do not have the wherewithal to pay the inflated prices, <Col N="929" /> such as the unemployed, others living on social welfare or senior citizens who survive on their pensions. It is important and fair that tickets are sold at face value and are available to the less well off. They should not be available for purchase by touts who exploit events and line their pockets.</P>
    <P>However, I question the deterrent and the figure of the fine. Today I listened to &ldquo;Lifeline&rdquo; on RTE and anybody who heard it will be aware that people were discussing tickets for the last rugby international and next Saturday's one which were £400, £600 and £800 a pair. There was one report of £1,200 for a pair of tickets. With that level of turnover, one would not be long making up the fine proposed in the Bill, but I know the reasons for the limitations constraining the Deputies in that regard.</P>
    <P>That the Garda will have the power of arrest, if there is reasonable cause for believing a person is committing an offence under the proposed legislation, will be a deterrent. I hope the threat of arrest and confiscation of tickets will be a real deterrent in preventing this unseemly activity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which allows registered charities and voluntary community organisations to sell tickets donated or purchased by them for more than their face value when they have been authorised to do so by the organisers of the event. However, there is too much pressure on many organisations to obtain finance in this way. The national lottery was meant to be more active in this area and I know the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation supports my belief that inadequate funds are made available to him to fulfil his responsibility in the area. It was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government but the work was done by a former coalition Government. The then Minister for Sport, Deputy Donal Creed, made an enormous contribution to the area of sport and recreation.</P>
    <P>This area should be examined to see if it is playing an effective role. If the Minister has any proposals in this regard I will be the first to support him. I congratulate the Deputies on bringing forward the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank all of those who spoke on the Bill which was tabled by myself and Deputy Naughten. I want to thank in particular the Minister, Deputy McDaid. We had a very constructive debate on the Bill and I welcome the approach taken by the Minister last night and that taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far too frequently, Private Members' time becomes a knock-about session at the end of which nothing of constructive value in a legislative context is produced. Opposition parties are not solely at fault for that. In the context of some Departments &ndash; Minister McDaid's Department <Col N="930" /> is an exception as was Minister Cowen's Department in terms of a Private Members' Bill I brought before the House last year &ndash; if an Opposition party produces a Bill, the Minister tends to see it as a challenge to his ministerial responsibilities. His or her civil servants, who jealously guard their bailiwick, regard it as their duty not to encourage a Minister to support in principle a Private Members' Bill but to pick as many holes in it as possible so that the Minister has many reasons to vote against it. We need more debates of this nature in Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>A good job of work was done in the House last night and this evening in tackling the scourge of ticket touts. The Bill, when it comes into force, will make ticket touts sporting outlaws and pop concert outcasts. For too long they have unscrupulously exploited the allegiances of real fans wishing to attend major musical and sporting events. When the Bill comes into force it will bring a halt to their activities.</P>
    <P>Last evening, in expressing welcome support for the measure, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation expressed doubt about conferring on the gardaí the powers to arrest ticket touts without a warrant. This evening the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, raised issue with the criminal provisions in the Bill. The criminal provisions are a vitally important part of this measure as they will enable the gardaí to arrest ticket touts outside the grounds of major sporting events, such as Lansdowne Road and Croke Park, prevent them selling tickets at exorbitant prices and facilitate them in confiscating those tickets. These measures will have the same effect in facilitating gardaí dealing with ticket touts at major pop concerts or other musical events. It is a central objective of the Bill that the presence of ticket touts at events of this nature be ended.</P>
    <P>As is the case with every Private Members' Bill I have tabled over the years, I accept that the phraseology contained in the Bill is not written on tablets of stone. I have no doubt that further work can be done on the Bill on Committee Stage to address any difficulties or concerns it is felt exist which will take away from its effectiveness. It is essential that gardaí are given specific powers under this measure to remove ticket touts from outside major sporting events, to confiscate tickets they have obtained and to prevent them selling tickets at exorbitant prices to real fans who do not have the same access to obtaining them as the touts.</P>
    <P>In so far as Minister McDaid and Minister Flood, or indeed my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, whose support for the Bill I also welcome, have reservations in this area, police forces in England and in France have similar powers. If they did not, the laws in force in those countries would not work. They have been used in England not just to get rid of ticket touts but to prevent fans of different teams mixing in the one area in grounds and causing the sorts of difficulties that occur from time to time among spectators at sporting events. <Col N="931" /> These types of powers are not seen in France or England as draconian but necessary to ensure that the genuine fan can gain access to tickets and enjoy the events they are attending without being subjected to difficulty in that context.</P>
    <P>There is a belief in some quarters that some of those &ndash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;some&rdquo;&ndash; engaged in ticket touting are organised by criminal gangs based either in this State or in England. There is a real ground for suspicion about the way some very shady characters manage to be present outside major sporting events on a regular basis, readily identifiable, and who the suppliers of the tickets are.</P>
    <P>Questions need to be asked also in regard to the advertisers for tickets in our newspapers. I call on the newspaper editors to apply the spirit of this legislation before we enact it and refuse to allow their columns to be used by people whose intent is to exploit young people and obtain large profits from them simply to gain access to sporting events to which the public should have easier access than is currently the case. Sadly, many of the advertisements carried by major newspaper groups in the context of sporting events add to the touting problem. That is the reason the Bill contains the important provision which outlaws such advertising. When the Bill becomes law it will strike a blow at those criminal gangs. This is an area the gardaí need to investigate.</P>
    <P>I am pleased we are referring the Bill to Committee Stage. With the Government's co-operation I believe we can complete Committee Stage soon after the Easter break and that there is a possibility of enacting the Bill into law before the summer vacation period. It should be our objective to ensure the Bill is operative before the All-Ireland finals take place this year and before we enter the pop concert season this summer.</P>

      <P>I want to add my voice to the debate on this important Bill, which is long overdue. I congratulate Deputies Shatter and Naughten on their foresight in bringing forward such worthwhile legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the experience on several occasions of writing to the GAA seeking to buy tickets for an All-Ireland final or semi-final and receiving a polite reply to the effect that because my team was not playing in the competition, tickets were not available, yet one can buy tickets from ticket touts at exorbitant prices on the day of these matches. If this practice is not stamped out genuine supporters of the various teams will become fed up with this problem. Only a certain number of tickets are allocated to each county, yet these ticket touts can obtain hundreds if not thousands of tickets to sell outside the grounds of Croke Park and Lansdowne Road. I congratulate the Minister on accepting this worthy legislation and on playing his role in doing away with the system of touting which has operated for many years and is becoming more prevalent by the day. The time has come to call a halt. I am delighted <Col N="932" /> the Minister has the courage an foresight to tackle this problem with the two Fine Gael spokespeople who presented this worthwhile legislation to the House.</P>

      <P>Yesterday it was announced that 120 jobs would be lost at Bourns Electronics Ireland in Mahon, Cork. The company employs more than 450 people. To the majority of us the announcement came out of the blue and it has created great worry and uncertainty for the remaining workers in Bourns and for those employed in the manufacturing of electronics in the greater Cork area. This announcement follows the loss of 450 jobs in Apple. The 120 people who are to lose their jobs in Mahon are not mere statistics. They are real people who depend on Bourns for their livelihoods and to meet their financial commitments. The jobs are being lost to Cork because the products can be produced more cheaply elsewhere. This follows the pattern of other job losses in the Cork region and it is a source of great worry and concern.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not here to address this issue. When 450 jobs were lost in Apple there seemed to be no recognition of the scale of the problem by the Tánaiste. She merely said she regretted the job losses. Her regrets are of little use to those who have lost their jobs.</P>
      <P>A third blow fell on Cork today when Liebert announced the loss of 150 jobs at its plant in Bishopstown. The Minister must tell us what is to be done about this. Will these people be retrained? What does the Tánaiste propose to do in consultation with the IDA to address this problem in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last six weeks Cork has suffered a huge number of job losses. Yesterday redundancies were announced in Bourns Electronics and today we hear that Cork has lost another 150 jobs at the American owned Liebert International plant based in Bishopstown. Cork is already reeling from the loss of 450 jobs at <Col N="933" /> Apple's Holyhill plant and 65 jobs at Universal Foods in Midleton. This week, 120 job losses were announced in Mahon and 150 in Bishopstown. Cork is not a big enough city to absorb these losses by providing alternative jobs quickly.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Clune, I too am disappointed at the Tánaiste's absence this evening. Did she have forewarning of the redundancies at Bourns and the closure of the Liebert plant and, if so, did she take action to prevent or reduce the number of job losses? More importantly, now that the jobs seem to have gone, will she ensure the 300 remaining jobs at Bourns are secure? Is she willing to prioritise Cork and the surrounding area for job creation over the next six to 12 months to make up for the 750 job losses suffered in the last six weeks? </P>
      <P>The majority of job losses were in the manufacture of low value-added products and production has moved to areas with cheaper sources of labour. In the case of Bourns Electronics, for example, the surface mount multifuse product has moved to Asia.</P>
      <P>We must continue to introduce the production of high value-added products to Ireland, and to Cork in particular. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment. Like the Tánaiste, I share their disappointment that Bourns Electronics plans to let go 120 workers at its plant in Mahon, Cork.</P>
      <P>Bourns Electronics has been located in Mahon, County Cork since 1980. The company currently employs more than 430 people in the manufacture of passive electronic components which are mainly used in computer and telecommunications products. Its parent company is Bourns Incorporated which is headquartered in Riverside, California in the USA. Bourns Incorporated has been in operation since 1947 and is recognised worldwide as a leader in the design, development and manufacture of electronic components with applications in automotive, telecommunications, computers and peripherals, aerospace and a variety of industrial and consumer products. Bourns Incorporated employs more than 3,500 people worldwide and operates manufacturing facilities in six different countries with sales and distribution support throughout North and South America, the Asia-Pacific and Europe. </P>
      <P>Bourns has been operating in Ireland for almost 20 years and the Irish plant is making major contributions to the Bourns global strategy. The company has made significant investments in Cork, primarily in manufacturing, but also including a consolidated European warehouse, a European financial centre, a technical support centre for Europe, new product development and a customer service centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Bourns Corporation has indicated that it can no longer sustain the manufacture of low margin, cost sensitive products in <Col N="934" /> Cork and that these products will now be manufactured at its plants in Costa Rica and China. This transfer of production will mean a reduction in employment at the Cork plant of 120 people through voluntary redundancies. Cork, nevertheless, will continue as a key manufacturing site for Bourns Incorporated based on high volume, highly automated products. In addition, it will provide medium volume, highly automated products that require significant process controls.</P>
    <P>While the Bourns announcement is clearly a major blow to the workforce affected, employment prospects generally are positive in Cork at present. Over the past two years 28 IDA backed projects involving more than £600 million worth of investment have been announced and are under way in Cork. These projects have the potential to create nearly 7,000 new jobs and more than 1,000 of these jobs are to be filled this year. In addition, the IDA will significantly upgrade its Kilbarry business park to improve and enhance its appearance and prospects of attracting new investments. The construction of a high quality 25,000 square feet advance factory is also due to commence there shortly. Last month two significant projects were announced for Cork. A £10 million IDA supported expansion plan for the healthcare company, Nycomed Ireland in Carrigtohil, County Cork was announced which will create an additional 150 jobs. In addition, Siemens, one of the world's largest electrical and electronics companies is to establish a customer call centre which will support the European market for the company's communications devices and e-commerce initiatives. This project will create 150 new jobs over four years and recruitment has already commenced.</P>
    <P>I assure the House, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Tánaiste who cannot be here because she is chairing an industrial development meeting, that the IDA will continue actively to promote Cork for overseas mobile investment and that every assistance will be given to employees at Bourns to find new employment. Members can be assured that the IDA, which looks after international mobile investment here, and Enterprise Ireland, which looks after the indigenous sector, and the Cork county and city enterprise boards and other State agencies, including FÁS, will do their utmost to redress this situation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to this Adjournment matter. I call on the Government urgently to address the escalating problem of homelessness in Dublin. At a time of such great economic prosperity, it is unacceptable that the number of homeless people in Dublin and throughout the country has grown so dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though our prosperity is increasing at such an excellent rate, it is an embarrassment to the Government that we have not demonstrated <Col N="935" /> an ability to accommodate those less fortunate. A survey carried out by the Simon Community in June 1998 showed a 37 per cent increase in the number of homeless people in Dublin compared to its last survey taken the previous December which showed there were 208 people sleeping rough in Dublin. That is a gross underestimation of the number who are homeless now.</P>
    <P>There are additional pressures on accommodation. A large number of asylum seekers are seeking accommodation, which puts pressure on the emergency supply of accommodation and on private rented accommodation. Many people in Dublin are facing rent increases of up to 25 per cent and 30 per cent. Every week tenants are being evicted or being handed notices of eviction from private landlords. There is also a shortage of emergency bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin are concerned about this problem. Through letters, telephone calls and conversations, they constantly ask why we are not helping these people. Is it not fundamentally right for people to be allowed shelter, one of the basic human needs? Does it not state in our Constitution that it is the State's duty to accommodate the weaker sections of the community? </P>
    <P>We need to invest further resources to combat this problem. I accept that extra resources have been invested, but they are not sufficient. We need to intervene more dramatically to avoid the problems of homelessness that exist in other capital cities. We can avoid the worst excesses of this problem if we do the right thing at this stage. If this problem is left unchecked, as the economy grows a separation will occur. Those who are successful will continue to be successful and those who are homeless will remain so. This will create a class of neglected and marginalised people who will be unable to contribute to our society.</P>
    <P>There are not enough hostels, beds or even room on the floor. The lucky ones who get a bed will have to wait months before moving out because there are not enough affordable flats. Couples who are homeless face a major problem. They have a choice of staying with their loved ones on the streets or being split up and sent to hostels.</P>
    <P>It has been well proven that homelessness works in a cycle and homeless children, especially, who go unassisted quickly become caught up in an ongoing cycle of homelessness, which persists throughout their lives. This problem is escalating out of control. The Simon Community said that by the time they start their soup run at 9 p.m. all accommodation is full and those they serve must sleep rough.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied we have accurate information about the numbers involved and a coherent plan to tackle the problem? What additional resources will be allocated to tackle the problem of homelessness? Is he satisfied that he has put in place the necessary resources to ensure that an assessment of homelessness will be carried out shortly? Are there any measures in <Col N="936" /> place to help homeless people improve their lives? This involves access to education, opportunities and training once shelter has been provided. One of the key factors related to the problem of homeless is the escalating drug problem. There are particular problems in relation to those who are homeless and drug abusers.</P>
    <P>I compliment the great work being done by groups such as the Merchant's Quay Project, the Simon Community, the Salvation Army and many others. I also draw the attention of the Minister of State to the issues related to the problem of homeless children, although this does not come directly under his brief. I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have wide powers to provide an effective response to homelessness in addition to the traditional response of local authority housing. The local authority housing programme continues to be an important element in meeting the accommodation needs of homeless people. The programme has been maintained at a high level in recent years and the 1999 provision is for 4,500 house starts, up from 3,900 in 1998, with capital funding of £230 million, an increase of £36 million on the 1998 provision.</P>
      <P>Homeless people get a considerable number of the tenancies allocated in local authority houses in the Dublin area. In 1997 Dublin Corporation and the three Dublin county councils allocated a total of 626 tenancies in their houses to homeless people.</P>
      <P>The social housing schemes, particularly the voluntary capital housing assistance scheme, are widely used to fund the provision of accommodation for homeless people by voluntary bodies. The funding limits for the capital assistance scheme were increased twice in the past 15 months, most recently in November 1998, to make the scheme attractive to voluntary bodies. The 1999 capital funding provision for the scheme is £16.5 million.</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget increased the funding for the provision by local authorities of hostel accommodation for homeless people from £2 million to £4 million in 1999. This funding is for the provision of suitable short-term and transitional accommodation for homeless people.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation provides funding to voluntary bodies towards the running costs of providing hostel and other accommodation for homeless people. The corporation has increased its contribution, with effect from October 1998, to £2,400 per bed unit per year from £1,200 previously. The Department of the Environment and Local Government recoups 90 per cent of this expenditure to the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Homeless Initiative was set up some years ago to improve and co-ordinate service provision for homeless people in the Eastern Health Board region. Funding is provided through the initiative and Dublin Corporation to <Col N="937" /> voluntary bodies towards the cost of resettlement services provided by them to assist homeless people to move out of the cycle of homelessness into independent living.</P>
    <P>The initiative is considering a report it commissioned on resettlement services with a view to making a policy submission to the statutory agencies. Resettlement services are increasingly seen as essential in responding to the needs of homeless people and reducing the pressure on emergency accommodation.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be carrying out the 1999 assessment of homelessness at the end of this month. A number of changes have been made, in consultation with the corporation and the Dublin Homeless Initiative, in the manner of carrying out this assessment to ensure it will be as comprehensive and accurate as possible and give a true picture of the extent of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Homelessness is a complex social problem. In some cases it is due to factors such as family breakdown, alcohol or drug misuse, etc., and needs a co-ordinated response. To this end, the Government has established a cross-Department team, chaired and serviced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, to develop an integrated response to homelessness covering such issues as emergency, transitional and long-term responses and issues affecting homeless people such as health, education and employment. A cross-section of statutory agencies and voluntary agencies operating in the area of homelessness have recently been invited to make submissions on how they see a more integrated response being developed.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the radio interview given yesterday morning by a person in the York Street Hostel operated by the Salvation Army. It was indicated that they had no blankets to give to homeless people calling to the hostel. I asked my Department to inquire into this and it has emerged that the person interviewed did not know that blankets are available from Dublin Corporation, which make blankets available to voluntary bodies. The Salvation Army indicated to officials in my Department that the views expressed were those of the individual interviewed and do not represent the views of the Salvation Army. The interview has caused it some embarrassment. To suggest that its hostel could be filled two or three times over if it had the capacity is ill-informed on the extent of the availability of hostel accommodation for homeless people. The Salvation Army enjoys a good working relationship with Dublin Corporation and it is anxious to maintain that relationship as well as maintaining a good relationship with my Department. I am happy to acknowledge this as the work done by the Salvation Army for the homeless is much valued by me and my Department. I treat this with the highest priority in terms of my responsibility for housing in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this motion because I was deeply concerned about a matter raised by one of my constituents. This constituent, having reached the age of 66, is entitled to a free television licence but cannot avail of it until the next renewal date of the licence, which is six months' hence.</P>
      <P>There is an anomaly, where pensioners become entitled to a free television licence from their 66th birthday but do not benefit from the scheme until the next renewal date of the licence. Some pensioners are being considerably disadvantaged, especially if their 66th birthday is six to nine months before the licence is due for renewal.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme is to save our senior citizens the cost of a television licence from their 66th birthday onwards. We should not be penny pinching or miserly in our approach. All senior citizens should have the full benefit of the scheme. I suggest that the scheme either be amended to allow pensioners claim from the date of their 66th birthday and that they be refunded the difference if their licence has time to run to renewal, or that the licence they receive at the renewal date after their 65th birthday be only for the period up to their 66th birthday.</P>
      <P>In these days of computers and information technology, it should not be beyond the ability of the Department to make such arrangements. The Department has already indicated in a reply to a letter which I wrote on behalf of this gentleman that this would be too difficult to administer. However, there is no reason, with the proper computers, they could not allow a person to purchase a licence for six months, for example, which would take him up to his 66th birthday.</P>
      <P>It is not much but it is important to the people who feel they have paid for an extra six months. Many of the terrific changes we have brought into our welfare legislation over the years have not been very costly but they have meant a great deal to the elderly recipients. Our country is marked out by the way we look after elderly people, the sick and the young. We cannot do too much for our elderly people. Fianna Fáil has a wonderful record of looking after the elderly, better than any other party in this State. I congratulate the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on the recent increases introduced in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I thank Deputy Briscoe for raising this matter. The Minister has asked me to extend his deepest apologies to Deputy Briscoe and the House for his inability to be present.</P>
      <P>The majority of the schemes operated by the Department have as their objective the direct income support of clients through cash payments. There are some schemes, however, where the benefit is delivered in kind rather than in cash payment. A number of these schemes, collectively referred to as the free schemes are free travel, free electricity and gas allowance, free television licence and free telephone rental allowance.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in Ireland aged 66 years or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. From April 1999, the scheme will be available to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance.</P>
      <P>The other free schemes, such as free electricity allowance, free television licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. From August 1999, the free telephone rental allowance will be available to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement. This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes are also available to low income pensioners who are not in receipt of a social welfare type pension and who satisfy a means test. The weekly means income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of the old age contributory pension, which is currently £83 for a recipient aged 66 to 79 years, and £88 for a recipient aged 80 years or over; plus £30; <Col N="940" /> plus any increases for dependants or for living alone.</P>
    <P>To qualify for the free schemes, the person must be living alone or only with certain excepted people who satisfy this condition. This condition is not applied in the case of persons aged over 75 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.</P>
    <P>The free television licence scheme was introduced in 1968 to enhance the quality of life of social welfare recipients and to assist those who might experience difficulty in meeting the one-off annual cost, currently £70, of their television licence. At the end of 1998 more than 218,000 people qualified for this scheme, at an annual cost of more than £15.3 million.</P>
    <P>A person who is awarded a free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance or free bottled gas refill allowance is entitled to a free television licence from the next due renewal date of his current television licence. To avail of the free licence, the applicant brings the letter of approval of one of the above allowances and the television licence renewal notice to his local post office which then issues the licence. Each subsequent free licence is then issued automatically by An Post.</P>
    <P>As individual applicants would have a different length of time left on their current licence when they apply for a free television licence, there would be substantial administrative difficulties, both for the Department and An Post, in awarding a free television licence from the date the application was received in the Department. This problem only arises with a customer's first free television licence. Subsequent licences are automatically issued by An Post for a 12 month period.</P>
    <P>Each case would have to be verified with An Post and either a refund, for the time remaining on the applicant's current licence, would have to be issued by the Department to the applicant or a partial free licence would have to be issued by An Post, the cost of which would ultimately be reclaimed from the Department.</P>
    <P>Changes in the current arrangements are not envisaged at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of important national significance and I need clarification from the Government of its collective intention on this matter.</P>
      <P>On 9 January 1999 the Government announced that the Cabinet had given approval to the Tánaiste to bring forward proposals for legislation to give work permits to asylum seekers. Work permits for non-EU nationals currently operate on an administrative basis under the Aliens Act. I understood the new proposal was to put the work permit system on a statutory basis for the first time and to allow asylum seekers who had been in the State for six months the right to work, pending the determination of their application to stay in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> The benefits of the scheme were outlined at the time by the Tánaiste and by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. They identified the skills shortages in our economy, the potential to augment the skills base of the country and the social benefits that would accrue. However, rejecting that call on the same day, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was quoted in <i>The Irish Times </i>of the 9 January as stating that the State already attracted a disproportionate number of asylum seekers because of what he called the generous regime applied to them. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was further quoted on the same day as saying that giving a right to work would simply create another pull factor, which would put further pressure on the asylum processing system and continue to delay recognition for genuine refugees in need of protection.</P>
    <P>From the outset, there was clearly a very strong difference of view between the Tánaiste, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It appears the strong divergence of opinion continued from January until last Monday's Cabinet meeting.</P>
    <P>We understand from replies given by the Tánaiste on the Order of Business today that she brought draft heads of a Bill to Government during the day long meeting last Monday and that the Government was divided on the matter. According to Deputy O'Donnell, the division was not along party lines and a number of Fianna Fáil Ministers supported her and the Tánaiste in the provision of this important right.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there is a skills base available among talented people who have a right to apply for asylum. I believed there was a consensus in the House that they should be given the right to work. In my home town of Wexford, there is quite a number of asylum seekers because of the town's proximity to the port of Rosslare. When I last checked the figures on 12 February, some 83 non-nationals were living in the town. The biggest single group are Romanians, of whom there are 37, but there are also Kosovans, Lebanese, Bulgarians, Africans, Poles and Yemenese. All of these people have talents to offer and there are employers in Wexford, as there are throughout the country, who are anxious to employ them. Meanwhile, the asylum seekers are condemned to poverty and to being dependent on the State. The false impression that they are spongers who are ripping off the system is feeding racism. Many of us in this House have received correspondence of a racist nature.</P>
    <P>It is important that we set matters right. In the first instance, it is important that the Government, which is clearly at sixes and sevens on this issue, states its policy clearly. The legislation is only at draft heads stage at the moment. According to the Tánaiste, it will be some weeks before they are approved so an optimistic view would be that the legislation <Col N="942" /> would be passed before the end of the year. I hope the legislation will be passed quickly and that the Minister will support it. In the interim, I would like to see the current administrative arrangements being utilised to allow these good people to work, pending the determination of their asylum applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin for raising this matter and providing me with an opportunity to clarify the position on it. It is a matter of public knowledge that the question of whether asylum seekers should be granted permission to work is currently being considered by the Government. We are considering all of the factors which need to be taken into account in assessing whether the existing position, which is that asylum seekers are not allowed to work, should be changed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin having been a Member of the previous Government will recall, even if he finds it somewhat inconvenient to do so, that the Refugee Act, 1996, which was promoted by the Administration of which he was a Member specifies at section 9(4)(b) that an asylum applicant shall not seek or enter employment or carry on any business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of his or her application. I remind Deputy Howlin that this is the legislation which I am continuously being asked to implement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I readily understand the Deputy's request for clarification given the confusing reports which have appeared in some newspapers. I would instance a report on the front page of yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>which commences by stating that the Government has failed to agree proposals to allow work permits for asylum seekers while, later in the same article, we are informed that the Government agreed in principle last year that such permits should be issued. These two statements which appeared in the same article cannot both be correct. The report that the Government agreed in principle to issue work permits to asylum seekers is totally false. If it were true, the matter would obviously not still be under consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin was a Member of a number of coalition Governments. He will be aware that a spectrum of views exist in any Government on issues of this nature. At the end of the day, I assure him we will conclude our deliberations on this important policy issue and will observe collective Cabinet responsibility for the matter when it is decided upon.</P>

    <P>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey): The last full formal review of the fire service was undertaken in 1981 in conjunction with the preparation and enactment of the Fire Services Act, 1981. The position is subject to ongoing review, as evidenced by the many developments which have occurred in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The provision of fire cover is a statutory duty of the individual local fire authorities. In accordance with section 10 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, it is a matter for each fire authority, <i>inter alia</i>, to assess its fire fighting needs and to establish and maintain the type of staffing arrangement they consider necessary or desirable to exercise their statutory duty.</P>
    <P>Three fire authorities, Cork, Dublin and Limerick County Boroughs, operate full-time fire services in a total of 14 fire stations. In addition, Sligo and Galway County Councils, Waterford County Borough, Drogheda Borough Corporation and Dundalk Urban District Council have a combination of full-time and retained fire services personnel. The remaining fire authorities have retained fire services. The total number of full-time personnel employed by fire authorities is approximately 1,200 and the total number of retained personnel is approximately 2,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 129 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>At the end of January, I announced my Department's water and sewerage services investment programme for 1999, which contains a range of measures to expand water supply infrastructure to meet domestic and industrial demand, to improve treatment and to conserve water supplies. This year's provision of over £275 million for water and sewerage services represents a 50 per cent increase on expenditure on these services in 1998 and is more than double the provision for these services in 1996. Between 1994 and the end of 1999 over £960 million will have been spent on water and sewerage services which, even allowing for adjustments for inflation, is well in excess of the £605 million envisaged in the National Development Plan 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>This 1999 programme includes 18 major public water schemes to commence construction this year at a cost of £61 million, a further 16 to continue construction at a cost of £79 million and 27 schemes worth £152 million to be advanced through planning. This year's programme also includes 15 water conservation schemes with a total cost of just under £50 million &ndash; 13 of these are already under way and the remaining two will commence in the short-term.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded a series of studies, undertaken on behalf of local authorities, over the past few years to assess existing levels of service in water supplies and to estimate future demand, taking account of parameters such as population increases and projected industrial and commercial development, with a view to determining the extent of future development of the water supply systems. A major study was completed in 1996 on the water supplies in the greater Dublin region, including counties Kildare and Wicklow. Studies have also been carried out in other cities and several other major population centres. These studies form the basis for the water conservation programme being funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>I have also commissioned consultants to carry out a national water audit, entailing the collection and analysis of data for the medium to large public water supplies which have not yet been the subject of a study, to assess the adequacy of existing systems for each area served and to make recommendations as to the appropriate approach for improving inadequate supplies to cater for existing and future demand. The consultants are due to report by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist in the development of rural water supplies, my Department has asked county councils, in consultation with the voluntary group sector, to prepare strategic rural water plans which will map out the best approach to the provision of an adequate water supply to households served by private group or individual supplies. As part of <Col N="947" /> this process, an assessment will be made of existing levels of services, quality of sources and current and future demand.</P>
    <P>My Department invited all local authorities in October 1998 to prepare and submit an assessment of needs at county or regional level for water services capital works. The needs assessment has a medium-term horizon to the end of 2006 and a longer term horizon covering the 20 year period commencing in 1999. It will take account of information emerging from the national water audit and the strategic rural water plans and will have regard to the development plan for the area and any relevant strategic planning guidelines. The needs assessment, which is to be submitted to my Department before the end of June, will input into the preparation of the Department's future water and sewerage services investment programmes. My Department has put forward the case for including substantial additional investment in water supply to support economic and social development as a national investment priority in the next National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>The completion of major water schemes between 1989 and 1997 has provided an increase in water treatment capacity nationally of 62 million gallons of water per day or the equivalent of providing additional supply to over 1,100,00 persons. Storage capacity has increased by over 61 million gallons in the same period. Output figures for 1998 will be available later this year.</P>

      <P>The 1999 allocation to Comhar within my Department's Vote is £180,000. This does not include the costs of three staff from my Department who have been assigned to provide a secretariat for Comhar. Those costs will be met from my Department's administrative budget.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for Comhar to determine its own work programme, within its overall terms of reference, and it must inform Government, through me, of that programme of work within three months of its establishment.</P>
      <P>Comhar's overall terms of reference are to advance the national agenda for sustainable development, to evaluate progress in this regard, to assist in devising suitable mechanisms and advising on their implementation, and to contribute to the formation of a national consensus in these regards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> I would expect that Comhar will make a significant contribution towards the national pursuit of sustainable development, notably by introducing a new partnership into Irish society which increases the participation of a broad range of sectoral interests in the development of policy in this important area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill 1999 which was circulated last week makes provision for research into the feasibility of introducing electronic methods of recording and counting votes using counted ballot papers from the 1999 European Parliament and local elections. At present, counted ballot papers can only be inspected by obtaining a High Court order made when the court is hearing a petition questioning an election and in the normal course of events, counted papers are destroyed six months after the election. Section 24 of the Bill will not introduce electronic voting and counting at elections; separate legislation would be required to do this.</P>
      <P>There are no costs available at this early stage nor is it possible to indicate, in advance of the planned research being undertaken, when such a system could be introduced or what its likely impact would be. The rules for counting votes in a PR-STV electoral system are complex and software development is unlikely to be straightforward. Extensive testing of both the equipment and software will be necessary before a pilot project could be recommended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium specifically pledges a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups and also the improvement and extension of the social housing programmes generally. On foot of these pledges and in response to increasing needs, substantially increased resources are being provided for the full range of social housing programmes in 1999.</P>
      <P>Almost £230 million is available for the local authority housing programmes in 1999, an increase of £35 million on last year. This will meet expenditure commitments on the ongoing programme at end of 1998 as well as the &ldquo;starts&rdquo; authorised for 1999. The financial allocations for the ongoing programme, including new starts, will be notified shortly to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Nationally, the local authority housing construction programme allows 4,500 &ldquo;starts&rdquo; this year, the highest level since 1986. Dublin Corporation has been notified of a programme of 600 housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo; for 1999, an increase of 100 &ldquo;starts&rdquo; on 1998. In relation to houses which the corporation may purchase under their 1999 programme, I am aware that the price of such purchases has, in common with house prices generally, increased appreciably in recent years.</P>
      <P>The response of Dublin Corporation to housing needs is not confined solely to the 600 &ldquo;starts&rdquo; authorised for 1999. Last year, the corporation provided housing accommodation for 1,700 households from a combination of newly constructed houses, purchased houses, refurbishment of existing flats, casual vacancies and the complementary social housing measures. I understand that the anticipated number of households which will be housed this year is of the same order.</P>
      <P>In addition to their housing construction programme, significant resources are also being made available to Dublin Corporation for redevelopment and refurbishment of its existing housing stock. The corporation continues to obtain significant funds under the remedial works scheme &ndash; a total of £74 million since the inception of the scheme, including £8 million in 1998. I have also approved the corporation's proposals for the comprehensive redevelopment of nine run down flat complexes throughout the city for which a provision of £6.5 million has been made this year. The redevelopment proposals consist of a mix of some new buildings, refurbishment of some flats, where this is considered feasible, and the demolition of other flats and their replacement with low rise housing at a total cost of £87.8 million spread over a five year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the main construction programme and the major redevelopment of flat complexes, I have also provided £21 million this year for the commencement of construction of new houses in Ballymun as part of the regeneration of the entire <Col N="950" /> estate. As these houses are constructed tenants will transfer from the tower blocks which will then be demolished as they become empty.</P>
    <P>It is also open to the corporation to utilise, in addition to its own housing programme, the voluntary and social housing options to respond to housing needs in its area. The new affordable housing scheme I announced yesterday is a further option now available to the corporation. The voluntary and social housing schemes have an increasingly important role to play in meeting housing needs and improvements in the terms and conditions of the schemes were designed to enable local authorities to promote and secure the expanded use of the schemes, thus reducing the pressure on local authority housing. I have asked all local authorities, including Dublin Corporation, to consider how the use of the various schemes in their areas can be expanded as a flexible and cost effective complement to their local authority housing programmes. In common with other local authorities, Dublin Corporation will be carrying out the assessment of housing needs at the end of this month and a clearer picture of overall housing needs will then be available. I will be closely examining the assessment figures as they come to hand.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the greatly increased provision for the social housing programmes for 1999 will considerably enhance the capacity of local authorities to meet social housing needs and that the options and measures that exist, if used to their full potential, will enable Dublin Corporation to respond positively to housing requirements arising in their area.</P>

      <P>Information available to my Department suggests that CO2 emissions from liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, fuelled engines are only slightly lower than emissions from petrol engines and may be no lower than emissions from diesel engines. There are, however, considerably lower emissions of other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, NOx, and particulate matter, PM10 from LPG engines. I am satisfied that the reduction of these pollutants, rather than reduction of CO2 emissions, is the main benefit of fuel switching to LPG.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to promoting the use of environmentally cleaner fuels and my Department continues to liaise with the Departments of Finance and Public Enterprise to encourage this. In budget 1999, the Minister for Finance reduced the VAT inclusive excise duty on LPG by 1.8 p. <Col N="951" /> per litre, taking account of the environmental impact of a rapidly increasing vehicle fleet.</P>
    <P>My Department will also participate in a new interdepartmental working group on the introduction of LPG-fuelled buses into the Dublin Bus fleet and is supportive of initiatives by Dublin Corporation to encourage increased LPG usage in the Dublin taxi fleet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Appendix A of the Environmental Protection Agency's report on Urban Waste Water Discharges in Ireland for 1996 and 1997 sets out the present levels of treatment for the 238 urban areas serving populations of more than 1,000. A copy of the report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the local authorities, is engaged in a major programme of works aimed at upgrading and improving water and waste water services. Over the period of the current National Development Plan, 1994 to 1999, more than £960 million of State and EU capital funding will be invested in improving these services. A significant proportion of the overall investment is being made to upgrade and provide waste water treatment and collection systems in accordance with the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive.</P>
      <P>Secondary treatment of waste water represents a high level of treatment that satisfies all the environmental requirements in most cases. This is recognised in Article 4 of the urban waste water treatment directive which requires secondary treatment to be provided by 31 December 2000 for all discharges to freshwaters and estuaries from urban areas of more than 15,000 population equivalent and by 31 December 2005 from urban areas between 2,000 and 15,000 population equivalent. Work is under way on the major schemes required to meet the 2000 deadline, including the waste water schemes in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Dundalk, Drogheda, Wexford and Galway. Planning is being advanced on all the other schemes required. As well as the investment that has already been made, an estimated £750 million remains to be spent over the period of the next National Development Plan on urban waste water treatment and collection systems to meet the requirements of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in exceptional circumstances that anything more than secondary treatment of waste water is required. Article 5 of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive requires member states to identify sensitive areas according to specific criteria laid down in the directive itself <Col N="952" /> and to provide more stringent treatment for discharges from urban areas of more than 10,000 population equivalent into these sensitive areas before 31 December 1998. Six rivers and four lakes were designated by my Department in 1994 as sensitive areas on the basis of their eutrophic condition and particular attention has been focused on providing phosphorous reduction facilities as well as secondary treatment for these. Of the nine towns with a population equivalent of over 10,000 in the catchments of these sensitive areas, phosphorous reduction facilities were in place at end 1998 at all three major towns in the Derg catchment, namely, Athlone, Nenagh and Tullamore. Similar facilities were also in place at end 1998 at Killarney in the Lough Leane catchment and Castlebar on the Castlebar River and will very shortly be in place at Navan on the Boyne catchment, Longford on the Lough Ree catchment and Cavan on the Lough Oughter catchment.</P>
    <P>Going beyond the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive, phosphorous reduction facilities are also being provided at many towns throughout the country which are below the 10,000 population equivalent threshold but where eutrophication of the receiving waters is a problem. For example, in the Derg/Ree catchment, such facilities are either already in place or are planned for an additional ten towns.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 685 of 27 January 1999, I have taken a number of measures, which I believe will help to facilitate a high turnout at this year's local and European elections. With a view to maximising turnout I announced in 1998 that the local elections will be held in conjunction with the European elections on Friday, 11 June 1999. By giving advance notice of the polling day, greater awareness of the elections has been generated. In addition, a publicity campaign took place in November 1998 advising persons to check the draft 1999/2000 register of electors and highlighting the fact the register will be used for this year's elections. I also intend to publicise the facility of the supplement to the register of electors whereby people can make late applications up to mid-May 1999 to be registered to vote at the June 1999 elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, this year I attended a media seminar organised by the European Parliament Office in Dublin to publicise the European elections at which I stressed the critical role the television, <Col N="953" /> radio and print media will play over the coming months in informing the public. I am hopeful that a vigorous campaign by the political parties and the candidates together with a well informed media debate on the issues will go some way towards facilitating a good turnout in both elections.</P>

      <P>The steep increase in the number of appeals coming before An Bord Pleanála is continuing, reflecting the high growth rate in the national economy. The intake of cases in 1998 was 16 per cent up on 1997. It is projected that the total number of cases received in 1999 will reach 5,230, which would represent a doubling of the annual average intake in the ten year period to 1995. The average time taken to dispose of cases in 1998 was 18 weeks and compliance with the four month objective was 63 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approved all the requests for additional personnel and other resources made by the board in 1998. These included increasing the number of board members by 50 per cent, from six to nine, and approving an additional eight heads of staff. Approved staffing in the board has increased from 71 in mid-1997 to 93 at end-1998. The board is currently attempting to fill the outstanding vacancies but has been experiencing difficulty <Col N="954" /> in recruiting planners. Although it will be into this year before the board has the full benefit of the extra board members and additional staff approved, the increase in the average time and the decline in meeting the four month objective is a cause of concern to me, particularly in the context of the need to increase housing supply as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I am actively reviewing, in conjunction with the board, the situation to see what additional staffing and other measures need to be put in place to expedite the processing of appeals and clear off the backlog that has built up. I expect when current consultations with the Department of Finance are completed to announce a series of measures to deal further with the problem. The board is also reviewing its work practices to ensure that due priority is given to large scale housing schemes.</P>

      <P>The key to more affordable rents in the private rented sector is, in the final analysis, the same as that for stabilising the housing market as a whole &ndash; increased supply of housing. The measures introduced in the Government's Action on House Prices, have restored a better balance between supply and demand in the housing market.

      <P>The European Commission has addressed a query to the Irish Government following complaints to it about the possible impacts of drainage works associated with the by-pass on Pollardstown Fen. The relevant Irish authorities have commissioned further investigation of certain environmental issues involved and a comprehensive response will be sent to the Commission shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the early 1980s, my Department has taken the opportunity on a number of occasions, both through the issuing of advice and through legislative change, to strengthen the hands of local authorities in dealing with unfinished estates. These measures have contributed to the considerably improved situation that exists now. However, I am well aware that some problems persist and I am determined to take whatever <Col N="957" /> further action is necessary to help remedy these and prevent them in the future.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of planning control is a matter for planning authorities. Where a development has been carried out without planning permission, or where the development does not comply with planning conditions, it is a matter for the planning authority to take enforcement action. In addition, it is open to any person to seek a court order under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, as amended, requiring compliance with conditions laid down by the planning authority. The Planning Acts specifically allow for conditions about the giving of security, the phasing and completion of works and the occupation of structures. Effective use of such conditions by local authorities, and follow-up enforcement action, can do much to obviate the kind of problems that arise in unfinished estates.</P>
    <P>The report of the strategic review of the construction industry which was published in June 1997, recommended the introduction of a national physical development bond scheme to guarantee the proper finishing of developments. The preparation of a scheme by the Forum for the Construction Industry is at an advanced stage and I am hopeful that a fully agreed bonding scheme will be available by the end of the year. Enforcement of planning control, including the issue of unfinished housing estates, featured prominently in the consultation process under the review of the Planning Acts on which I have been engaged. My proposals to strengthen considerably the enforcement of planning control will be contained in the major Bill to reform and consolidate the Planning Acts which I hope to publish by mid-year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I received copies of the Irish Home Builders Association's voluntary code of practice on Monday 25 January 1999, the day it was launched. Although it is a voluntary code in the sense that the industry has developed the code itself, I understand that adherence to the code will be mandatory for all members of the association. The introduction by the industry of such a voluntary code of practice was, of course, one of the recommendations of the Bacon report. The report also recommended that if this approach does not work, widening of the statutory role of <Col N="958" /> the Director of Consumer Affairs in this area should be considered.</P>
      <P>The protection afforded to the new house purchaser by the prevention of an increase in price and prohibition on acceptance of any offer from any other party for a seven week period following payment of a booking deposit represents an improvement on the previous situation.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach in relation to elimination of gazumping is to pursue practical measures, through support for the introduction of a code of practice, which will help to improve the situation in the short-term, while also arranging to have the possibility of any appropriate legal response carefully and thoroughly examined. Following an approach by me in this regard, the Attorney General requested the Law Reform Commission to review the procedure of payment of booking deposits and the associated practice of gazumping and to submit to the Attorney General proposals for reform in respect of those matters, if any, that the commission considers appropriate. This review is under way.</P>
      <P>While the impact of the code of practice remains to be seen the possibility of a legislative approach to gazumping, if the voluntary approach does not work, should help to ensure maximum commitment by all concerned to ensuring the effectiveness of the code of practice.</P>
      <P>It should also be noted that the action taken by the Government to curb overheating in the housing market will help to remove the conditions in which practices such as gazumping can develop. House prices data which I intend to publish shortly suggest a moderation in the rate of house price increases in the latter part of 1998.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in the reply to Question No. 231 of 9 February 1999, I am aware of a recent newspaper report which refers to adverse comments contained in two European tourist guidebooks in relation to drinking water in Ireland. The reported comments regarding the quality of Irish drinking water are grossly inaccurate.</P>
      <P>The quality of drinking water in Ireland is comprehensively monitored by local authorities under the supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA publishes a detailed annual report of the monitoring results. The latest EPA report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, covering the year 1996, confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water. In relation to public supplies, it indicated that compliance levels in respect of strictly health related parameters were above 98.5 per cent in 1996, apart from coliforms. In the case of coliforms, the compliance levels were 92.4 per cent, representing a slight improvement on the 1995 position. The report acknowledges that there are quality problems in the private group supply sector which supplies drinking water to about 5 per cent of households in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The quality problems associated with the private group supply sector are being tackled in a comprehensive manner under the rural water programme. Thirty million pounds has been allocated to the programme in 1999, an increase of £7 million on 1998.</P>
      <P>A programme of substantial capital investment is being pursued for the purpose of providing and upgrading water supply schemes to cater for demands generally and ensure compliance with the quality standards of the drinking water directive. Expenditure on major water schemes since 1994 has totalled over £265 million. In 1999, £275 million is being provided under the water and sewerage services investment programme overall, representing an increase of 50 per cent on expenditure in 1998 and more than double the expenditure on these services in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> Clarification in relation to the quality of drinking water in Ireland is being taken up directly with the publishers of the guidebooks concerned.</P>

It is my understanding that housing authorities generally do not now provide bedsit type dwellings for senior citizens.</P>
      <P>Accommodation provided by housing authorities for elderly people may include, where appropriate, such facilities as alarm systems and warden accommodation, the capital cost of which can be met from the capital funding for the particular housing scheme. It is a matter for each housing authority to consider whether the provision of such facilities in an individual scheme is appropriate. The funding of any operational costs, including staffing of an alarm or warden system, would be a matter for the housing authority from their own revenue resources.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are increasingly operating on an area basis thus bringing service delivery closer to their local communities. This is a trend I have actively supported <Col N="964" /> and encouraged. The independent boundary committees I established to review local electoral areas had terms of reference which required a new focus on service delivery areas. Orders implementing the committees' reports have been made. In addition, I have provided funding to enable six one stop shop initiatives to proceed. Implementation of the recommendations of the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems will, <i>inter alia</i>, see local authorities playing a substantial role in the integration process and in ensuring that all public services operating locally will work to a common agenda. Integration was recommended by the devolution commission. Local authorities will lead the county/city development boards, to be established from 2000, which will be responsible for drawing up and implementing a strategy for economic, social and cultural development in each county and city. The success of the county/city development boards will be a major challenge and opportunity for all the local participants, including the local authorities. Implementation of the taskforce's recommendations will give local authorities a wider role and will provide the framework under which consideration can be given to an evolving role for local government with a wider range of functions.</P>

      <P>The Bank of Ireland have made proposals for a shared ownership scheme with the bank providing a 20 year fixed rate mortgage to cover 60 per cent of the purchase price of a house. Under the proposal, the State would fund 35 per cent and the prospective purchaser would fund the remaining 5 per cent of the cost. The equity held by the State would be remunerated by an annual rent and capital value escalation on purchase of the equity outstanding. This would require the purchaser to make a large payment in respect of the State held equity at the end of the loan period, or earlier purchase of the equity.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that this proposal does nothing to increase the supply of housing and by adding further to demand in the market would lead inevitably, in current market conditions, to price increases at the lower end of the market. I believe that the bank acknowledges that an increase in housing supply is a necessary prerequisite at this stage to a financial package such as this.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>Extensive statistics on the operation of the planning system are published annually by my Department and are available in the Oireachtas Library for the years up to 1997. Summary statistics are similarly published on a quarterly basis. The statistics are not compiled on a basis that allows identification of either applications for or grants of planning permission in respect of wind farms. However, in reviewing the scope and content of planning statistics now collected, my Department will consider seeking the type of statistics referred to in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that wind farm developments have attracted opposition. My Department published guidelines on wind farm development for the guidance of planning authorities, developers and the general public in September 1996. The guidelines identify relevant planning and land use issues which planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála should have regard to in considering an application for planning permission or an appeal for a wind farm. They also provide guidance on how wind energy should be dealt with in the preparation of development plans. The guidelines also highlight a number of important aspects to be borne in mind in processing development proposals, including pre-planning discussions, visual <Col N="966" /> impact, noise and the need to take into consideration the impact which a wind farm would have on the ecology, archaeology, geology and heritage of an area.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are also intended to facilitate implementation of Government policy in relation to the development of renewable sources of energy. This is of particular relevance in the context of climate change, where more use of alternative sources of energy can play a role in national and international efforts to tackle the problem of CO2 emissions, the dominant greenhouse gas implicated in climate change.</P>

In this context, a significant range of initiatives which both directly and indirectly enhance the role of the local elected members, have been progressed, including: Strategic Policy Committees, including representatives of local sectoral interests have been established in city and county councils to enhance the policy making role of councillors and to involve the local community more closely in the work of the authorities; implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Task Force on Integration of Local Government and Local Development Systems will see local government, State agencies operating locally, local development agencies, the social partners and the wider community working together on the basis of real partnership under the local <Col N="967" /> government umbrella on the proposed county/city development boards; the task force is overseeing implementation of the recommendations; the Local Government Fund provides a secure and buoyant funding source, with additional resources for local authorities; there will be a gratuity for eligible councillors retiring before the next local elections which will encourage participation by younger candidates and women candidates as well as giving recognition for service to the community; the boundaries of electoral areas for local elections were reviewed by independent boundary committees, with terms of reference requiring a new focus on service delivery areas, and orders implementing the committees' reports have been made and a modern legislative framework for local government is being drafted, which will strengthen and enhance the role of the elected member.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the company in question, which is involved in the collection of metal cans for subsequent export and reprocessing, is experiencing market difficulties arising from a significant downturn in world prices for metal recyclables.</P>
      <P>Most if not all waste cans which are collected for recovery in this country are exported to a single reprocessor in the UK. I understand that Repak Ltd., which was established by industry to promote and facilitate the recycling/recovery of packaging waste, is in discussion with this UK concern, with a view to securing arrangements which would benefit all Irish suppliers of this recyclable material.</P>
      <P>The National Waste Database, NWD, report published by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1996 indicates that in 1995 &ndash; 7.8 per cent of municipal waste was recycled; almost 22 per cent of packaging waste in the municipal and non-hazardous industrial waste streams was recycled; and 17.3 per cent of reported industrial waste arisings were recovered.</P>
      <P>The NWD is currently being updated in respect of 1998.</P>
      <P>The 1994 National Recycling Strategy Recycling for Ireland, set an overall target of diverting 20 per cent of household and commercial waste from landfill through recycling by 1999, and a target recycling rate of 30 per cent for packaging waste by 1999.</P>
      <P>EU Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste requires that Ireland attain the following targets: recovery of a minimum of 25 per cent by weight of packaging waste by 30 June, 2001; and recovery, before the end of 2005, of a minimum of 50 per cent and a maximum of 65 per cent by weight of packaging waste, to include an overall recycling target of 25 per cent, with a minimum recycling rate of 15 per cent for each individual packaging material.</P>
      <P>Repak Ltd. was granted approval for the purposes of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997 on the basis, <i>inter alia</i>, that it would achieve an overall target recycling rate of 27 per cent for packaging waste by 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The October 1998 policy statement on waste management, Changing our Ways, set the following recovery targets to be achieved over a 15 year timescale: a diversion of 50 per cent of overall household waste away from landfill, a minimum 65 per cent reduction in biodegradable wastes consigned to landfill, the development of biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum, recycling of 35 per cent of municipal <Col N="969" /> waste, and recycling at least 50 per cent of C&amp;D waste within a five year period, with a progressive increase to at least 85 per cent over 15 years.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to prepare a policy statement on recycling and waste recovery generally, for publication later this year. This policy document will address the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in this area, and outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in support of better recycling performance.</P>

The study will address all of the planning issues in relation to large scale retail developments, including the socio-economic aspects and, in particular, will identify the amount and location of existing large scale retail development and will estimate the amount, type and phasing of retail development needed in Ireland over the next ten years. The consultants are also to draw up draft planning guidelines appropriate to Irish circumstances.</P>
      <P>I expect to be able to publish draft planning guidelines together with the consultant's report by mid-April 1999. There will then be a public consultation period. All observations received in relation to the draft guidelines will be taken into consideration and I will issue a final version of the guidelines as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>House price increases over the last two years have created an affordability gap for many aspiring house purchasers. To assist in bridging this gap, I announced yesterday a new affordable housing scheme which will be available to those households who satisfy an income test &ndash; up to £20,000 in the case of a single-income household, or those who surrender their local authority or voluntary accommodation. New houses at cost price will be provided by local authorities on land available to them. Mortgage finance at 4 per cent variable or 4.4 per cent fixed will be made available to the purchasers of housing supplied under the scheme. A subsidy payment will assist with mortgage repayments of purchasers with household incomes of up to £16,000. In effect, the scheme will make house purchase affordable for households with incomes appreciably below £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> Crucial to consideration of any proposals to improve housing affordability is the need to avoid measures which would increase demand without a corresponding increase in housing supply as any such measures would only further fuel house price inflation. The affordable housing scheme which I launched yesterday fulfils this demand as it meets both sides of the demand/supply equation.</P>
    <P>In addition, as part of the package of measures in the Government's Action on House Prices, the income eligibility limits for the shared ownership scheme were increased last year from £15,000 to £20,000 for single-income households with a corresponding increase for two-income households. Over 800 households availed of the shared ownership scheme in 1998 and there are also indications that applications under the scheme, which had been declining prior to the increase in income limits, have picked up significantly. Shared ownership remains an option available to households with incomes of less than £20,000 who wish to purchase their own home.</P>
    <P>Data received by my Department from the lending agencies also indicates that a significant proportion of home purchasers in 1998 had incomes of less than £20,000.</P>

      <P>I have not sought or received a report from the Environmental Protection Agency regarding genetically modified organisms and the environment.</P>
      <P>The powers vested in the agency under the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations 1994 (S.I. No. 345 of 1994), <i>inter alia</i>, serve to transpose into national law the competent authority provisions of two EU Directives, Directives 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms, and 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms to the environment. I am satisfied that the agency has adequate powers under part III of the above-mentioned regulations to refuse consent to a field trial, arising from its consideration of any specific notification of intent given to it in this regard.</P>
      <P>Directive 90/219/EEC has been updated and strengthened by amending Directive 98/81/EC of 26 October 1998. I will be amending the 1994 regulations for the purpose of transposing the provisions of the amending directive into national law by June 2000. In addition, a proposal from the European Commission to update Directive 90/220/EEC is under consideration by the EU Council of Environment Ministers and is likely to give rise to a further updating of the 1994 regulations in due course.</P>

      <P>On foot of the strategy set out in the greater Dublin water strategic study a major investment programme has been put in place to ensure that the needs of the expanding Dublin area can be met. The programme consists of the expansion of the Leixlip water treatment works, a major water conservation programme and a number of other projects to upgrade and refurbish treatment works, reservoirs and the distribution system. The expansion of the Leixlip works will add significant extra capacity to Dublin's water supply from next June onwards but will result in supply disruptions in certain areas in the meantime as part of the process of bringing it on line. Consumers are being kept aware of the position through notices in the media.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to establish a new single water authority for the greater Dublin area. However, there is already in existence a water management team for the greater Dublin area which is chaired by Dublin Corporation and includes all the other Dublin authorities as well as Kildare and Wicklow County Councils. The management team meets on a monthly basis to co-ordinate planning and activities in relation to water supplies, but it has been meeting weekly since planning began for bringing into operation the current measures to expand the supply. Furthermore, the implementation of major projects, such as the current conservation project, is overseen by steering groups which include all the relevant local authorities and my Department.</P>

      <P>The Local Employment Service, Obair, operates and is managed nationally under the aegis of my Department. Its designated role is to provide a service for the long-term unemployed and socially excluded at greatest remove from the labour mar<Col N="975" /> ket. It is funded almost in its entirety by my Department although with a contribution from the relevant partnership in each case. Each LES has a local management committee which is normally drawn from the partnership in which it is based. The LES is operational in 18 areas, 16 partnerships and two non-partnerships, and is currently being extended to a further seven areas and there is a commitment in principle to extend it to all partnership areas.</P>
      <P>Each year there is a substantial investment in the employment services, both in the FÁS employment service and the LES, and I have been concerned for some time that the services operating as they do largely independent of each other, are not functioning optimally as a resource and support to the unemployed and other jobseekers. Therefore, I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly which provide for a closer alignment of the two services and will assign to an advisory board, representative of the FÁS board and the stakeholders in the LES, responsibility for development of the employment service in a coherent and integrated way which will allow both elements of the service to play to their strengths and provide for local input to both elements of the service.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the owners of Seale Clothing Ltd. informed Enterprise Ireland of their intention to sell the company as a going concern and that the agency has assisted them in their attempts to find a buyer by approaching several expanding companies on their behalf. However, as no buyer was forthcoming, the company has announced that it will cease trading on 22 April 1999.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, grant aid has been paid to Seale Clothing Ltd. on a number of occasions, comprising mainly of capital, research and development grants and feasibility study grants. In addition, FÁS has paid training grants to the company in the past two years. These grants, which were under the training support scheme, enabled the company to appoint a consultant to bring staff skills up to European standards to assist the company's export drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in recent times, the company has, like many others in the sector, operated in an <Col N="976" /> extremely volatile market and has been sensitive to low cost imports from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. Enterprise Ireland is working with these companies to try to minimise the impact of such pressures.</P>
    <P>I understand that a FÁS placement services officer has been in touch with Seale Clothing Ltd., and will visit the company on Thursday, 4 March 1999 to fully brief the staff on the range of FÁS services available to them. These services include job referrals/job placement opportunities from the current FÁS job vacancy list, advice regarding FÁS courses relevant to future job aspirations, one-to-one interviews with placement officers on career planning, CV preparation, personal development, etc. and ongoing FÁS support through the FÁS self service job vacancy system.</P>
    <P>The Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation, ICMF, has expressed optimism for the re-employment of Seale Clothing Ltd. workers, pointing out that there are currently a large number of vacancies in the clothing industry in Dublin. In fact, Enterprise Ireland has already indicated that up to 20 of the workers may be employed by another company in the area which is currently recruiting experienced machinists.</P>

      <P>I met the Deputy Foreign Minister of Cuba, Mr. Jorge Bolanos Suarez, on 21 September last during the UN General Assembly in New York. An earlier contact took place on 3 June 1998, when the Cuban Ambassador to Britain called on the <Col N="978" /> Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin. Most recently, officials from the Department met the Cuban Deputy Trade Minister, Mrs. Estrella Madrigal, in Dublin on 5 October.</P>
      <P>We have fully utilised all appropriate occasions to express our concern about human rights in Cuba. We have drawn attention to the EU's insistence that full membership of the EU-ACP Convention will depend on full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>It was under Ireland's Presidency in 1996 that the EU adopted its common position on Cuba. As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 23 February, the common position makes clear that wholehearted co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persistent absence of fundamental human and political rights. In its fourth evaluation of the common position, the General Affairs Council on 7 December last reiterated that our objective remains the encouragement of a peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living conditions of the Cuban people.</P>
      <P>On behalf of all member states, EU Heads of Mission resident in Cuba have made numerous representations to the authorities designed to secure greater observance of human rights, especially the release of political prisoners. Since the Pope's visit in January 1998, we have seen an improvement, in particular a reduction in the number of such detainees. However, there is still cause for concern with imprisonments for political offences continuing. I am concerned also that trials sometimes take place without the opportunity for adequate preparation of the defence. Furthermore, recently the climate has disimproved again with tighter surveillance of dissidents and the introduction last month of new and even harsher legislation aimed at curbing opposition.</P>
      <P>Ireland has supported a number of resolutions on human rights in Cuba at the UN Commission on Human Rights. At the forthcoming session of the commission, we will work with our partners on this issue, taking account of the recent negative developments, and we will once again call on Cuba to co-operate with all the human rights mechanisms of the UN.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The European Commission put forward a proposal in March 1998 for a Council regulation on the registration and operation within the Community of certain types of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes which have been modified and recertificated as meeting the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. The purpose of the proposed regulation is to prevent a further deterioration of the noise situation around EU airports. The Governments of a number of EU countries have been coming under increasing pressure to introduce unilateral noise abatement measures at the major hub airports.</P>
      <P>The Commission considers that the environmental performance of hushkitted and similarly modified aeroplanes, in terms of fuel burn and atmospheric pollution, is in general worse, and the noise level of these aircraft significantly worse, than for modern current production aircraft and that hushkitted and similarly modified aircraft make a disproportional contribution to the noise impact and degradation of the environment around airports.</P>
      <P>The EU Transport Council unanimously adopted a common position on the draft regulation in November 1998. The European Parliament approved the Council's common position on 10 February 1999. Ireland agreed to the proposed regulation after a process of consultation with airlines on the Irish register. Through laying down common EU-wide aircraft noise standards and avoiding proliferation of unilateral measures, the regulation will ensure certainty of access to airports in other EU countries for airlines on the Irish register, including night freight operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Government of the United States has concerns about the implications of the proposed measures for their air transport industry. I understand that the European Commission had intended to propose adoption of the proposed regulation at a very early date but that the Commission is now considering the question of deferring the adoption of the proposed regulation <Col N="980" /> to allow for further consultations with the US on the proposed measures.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the EU regulations if the stocking density of a holding is less than 1.4 Lus/hectare animals eligible for payment under the special beef premium and suckler cow premium schemes are entitled to extensification premium payment. In regard to the application referred to by the Deputy in the first question, the person named applied for 11 special beef premium animals under the 22 month special beef premium scheme on 14 January 1998. Of these, two animals were rejected. Therefore nine animals were eligible for special beef premium with a potential entitlement to nine extensification premiums if the stocking density is less than 1.4 Lus/ HA. As two animals were rejected on this claim a reduction penalty of 18.18 per cent will be applied to those nine eligible animals under any extensification premium payment in this case.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted further applications for five animals on 14 January 1998 and four animals on 18 March 1998 under the ten month special beef premium scheme and four animals on 18 March 1998 and two animals on 26 May 1998 under the 22 month special beef premium scheme. A total of 80 per cent advance payments of the special beef premium issued on 14 of those animals. Advance payment will issue on the remaining animal shortly.</P>
      <P>The 1998 extensification payments will commence in May/June. If the stocking density of the person named is under 1.4 Lus per hectare then appropriate payment will issue on all eligible animals paid under the special beef premium scheme.</P>

At a subsequent inspection carried out on 30 April 1998 ten in-calf heifers were presented. The inspecting officer was not satisfied that the animals were part of a herd intended for rearing calves for meat production resulting in the applicant being ineligible for the 1997 suckler cow premium. The applicant was notified of this decision by letter on 21 July 1998 and was advised that he could seek a review within 21 days. The case was reviewed when further documentation was submitted by the applicant.</P>
      <P>The review established that although the original ten cows on which the application was based were in the applicant's possession at the time of application, documentation on file shows that they never came into his ownership and were collected by the owner and returned to his premises on approximately 6 or 7 December 1997. In relation to the in-calf heifers presented for inspection on 30 April 1998, documentation on file indicates that these animals were procured from another herdowner on the understanding that they would be returned to the owner at the end of the retention period and before they had calved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the expert group on integrating the tax and social welfare systems, commonly referred to as the TWIG report, was published in 1996. The group's terms of reference covered policy on both taxation and social welfare. The recommendations relating to social welfare measures are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. The report contained three principal recommendations in relation to tax policy: (1) the gradual elimination of the general income tax exemption limits thereby eliminating marginal relief; (2) the gradual phasing out of the employment and training and health levies over time as resources permit, started by converting the threshold into an allowance; and (3) improved co-ordination of tax and social welfare reforms.</P>
      <P>The exemption limit and marginal relief system was identified by the group as a contributory factor in unemployment and poverty traps. Following the changes I announced in the budget of 1999, the first of these recommendations has been largely achieved. The basic personal allowances for the forthcoming tax year, of £4,200 for a single person and £8,400 for a married couple, exceed the general exemption limits of £4,100 for a single person and £8,200 for a married couple. The general exemption limits will now apply only to a small number of married couples on low incomes with three or more children. The numbers on marginal relief have fallen from over 16 per cent of the taxpaying population to just over 2 per cent arising from measures introduced in the last three budgets. Most of the remaining marginal relief cases represent taxpayers aged 65 and over who have a considerably higher exemption limit and where the considerations applied by the TWIG to the general exemption limits would have very limited relevance.</P>
      <P>The second recommendation, concerning the levies has been addressed by increasing the threshold for the payment of the levies. However, phasing out of the levies would be costly, and it would not benefit anyone with earnings below the threshold, currently £10,750 per year, though it would be of considerable benefit to those above this threshold. In the 1999 budget, I increased the threshold for payment of the levies to £11,250. I also restructured the levies by abolishing the employment and training levy of 1 per cent and increasing the health levy to 2 per cent, resulting in a reduction of 0.25 per cent in the combined levy charge. The recommendation concerning the levies will be borne in mind in the context of the preparation of future budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> On the third recommendation, the analysis undertaken by the expert group pointed to the benefits which could be obtained from a more co-ordinated approach to reforms of the tax and social welfare systems, and the need to study this interaction has been taken on board in the formulation of tax and social welfare packages in recent budgets.</P>
    <P>The contents of the TWIG report will continue to be taken into account in the formulation of proposals for further changes in the income tax system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the treatment of spouses, there is no inequality of treatment for spouses within the Irish income tax code. Married couples have the option of joint assessment, separate assessment or of being assessed as two single people. Under joint assessment, either spouse can be nominated as the assessable person. Where they avail of the option for assessment on their joint income, they are entitled to double the allowances, rate bands and so on available to a single person. The combined allowances are allocated between the spouses on the basis of their instructions to the tax office. In a case where only one of the spouses is in paid employment, this facility for joint assessment is of significant benefit as the couple can instruct the tax office to allocate the total tax allowances to the employed spouse.</P>
    <P>Where joint assessment applies, a married couple may opt for separate assessment under which the couple are taxed as if they were not married but the total allowances due to them as a married couple are divided between them. However, any unused portion of the bands or allowances which one partner has can be assigned to the other spouse, normally at the end of the tax year. The total combined tax paid under separate assessment for a married couple will be the same as that which would be paid by them under joint assessment. An election for separate assessment may be made by either spouse, that is, joint election is not required.</P>
    <P>Where a couple elect for single treatment each spouse is treated as a single person with no right of transfer of allowances or reliefs between them. This treatment can result in the couple paying more tax than they would under joint assessment or separate assessment. Again, either spouse may elect for single treatment.</P>
    <P>In some cases, married women who work are taxed at a high rate on low earnings. This is because, in these cases, most of the couple's income tax personal allowances are being used by their husbands. In this case, the wife avails of only the PAYE allowance, which was standard rated and increased to £1,000 in this year's budget, and the increase in the married allowances is allocated to her husband. However, it is open to the couples concerned to contact their tax inspectors to have a greater portion of their allowances allocated to the wife, thereby more evenly spreading the tax burden between the couple.</P>

    <P>I appreciate the situation of the family of the deceased but, as I have previously indicated in my reply to a similar question on Wednesday, 24 February, the provision of services in the histopathology department at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.

      <P>Our inhabited offshore islands lie within the areas of responsibility of three health boards and it is the statutory responsibility of these boards to provide health services to the population.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the North-Western Health Board that it has established a steering committee which is in discussion with island representatives to agree an action plan for service enhancements. Donegal County Council and other agencies also work with the board in this pursuit. Both Arranmore Island and Tory Island have permanent public health nursing services and there is also a permanent general practitioner service on Arranmore which is also provided with a weekly dental service, a monthly chiropody service, a twice monthly community welfare service and a social work service as required. There are plans to introduce an optician service. There is a social work service to Tory Island as required.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board has advised me there are seven inhabited islands in its region. There is a permanent public health nursing service on Cape Clear Island and on Bere Island. A general practitioner attends as required and in addition there are regular clinics on Cape Clear Island. School medical services are provided annually on Cape Clear, Sherkin and Bere Islands but the children of Whiddy Island attend school on the mainland. There are no children on Dursey, Hare or Long Islands.  The board has informed me that it would not be feasible to provide a dental service on the islands as the proper maintenance of equipment would be a particular difficulty because of infrequent use and the problems of corrosion from sea air. Similarly there are no arrangements for the provision of ophthalmic services on the islands, although neither service should require frequent visits to the mainland. Visits by social work staff and community welfare staff are arranged as required. Arrangements are being made for the provision of an island based chiropody service.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board has advised me that apart from the general practitioner resident on Inishmor a second GP has been engaged under a pilot scheme allowing for the provision of a full service to Inishmor and a weekly service to Inishmaan and to Inishere.  There is a weekly children's dental clinic held on Inishmor and annual school visits to the three Aran Islands. Residents of Inishboffin attend Clifden health centre for dental treatment. There is an annual visit by an ophthalmologist to the Aran Islands for both adults and children, residents of Inishboffin attend Clifden. A chiropodist visits Inishboffin twice a year but there is an arrangement that if treatment is required by in individual who is visiting Galway they will be facilitated. Assistance is provided to residents of Inishmaan and Inishere travelling to Inishmor for dental treatment.</P>

Under EU Directive 96/36/EC, member states will be allowed from 1 October 1999 to require that all seating positions in new passenger vehicles with seating for more than eight persons, excluding the driver, are fitted with seat belts: vehicles designed to accommodate standing passengers are excluded.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, urban renewal schemes are subject to the normal planning process, both in the context of preparation and adoption of development plans by planning authorities and, in the case of individual projects, the requirement to obtain planning approval.</P>
      <P>These schemes have been very successful in regenerating many run down areas in towns and cities around the country and have led to investment totalling £2.5 billion in the areas designated under the schemes. The schemes have also featured many outstanding examples of well planned and designed projects around the country. However, there has been a recognition that the standard of architectural and urban design has been of mixed quality; this was borne out in the findings of the KPMG study on the urban renewal schemes published in 1996.</P>
      <P>In 1996 my Department issued guidelines aimed at improving the standard and mix of apartments being provided in designated areas under the last urban renewal scheme. The guidelines covered site planning, communal facilities and amenities, internal design and layout, apartment size, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of recommendations made in the KPMG study, a new approach was adopted for <Col N="997" /> future schemes. This involved the preparation of integrated area plans prepared by local authorities with widespread public consultation and involvement. One of the main benefits of the IAP approach on which the new urban renewal scheme is based is that it provides an intermediate level of planning between the broad objectives of the development plan and the detail of development control. My Department prepared a set of detailed guidelines on IAPs which dealt with urban design, archaeology, conservation and other aspects of good planning and development.</P>
    <P>The IAP approach should make a significant improvement in the quality of planning under the new urban renewal scheme and my Department is currently developing detailed monitoring guidelines for local authorities aimed at ensuring that the integrated values underpinning the scheme are maintained in its implementation.</P>

They will include guidance on planning conditions which are imposed for the protection of the archaeological heritage, including when it is necessary and appropriate to impose conditions requiring the preservation of archaeological remains <i>in situ</i>, or, in the alternative, requiring archaeological monitoring or excavations. The guidelines will also assist developers to evaluate possible archaeological requirements when preparing development proposals.</P>

      <P>Strategic policy committees, SPCs, made up of elected members and external representatives, including community representatives, have now been established in each county and city local authority. The SPCs were established in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department. I am establishing a broadly representative working group to review the operation of these guidelines. This review will have regard to the process of establishment of the SPCs, including the involvement of external representatives.</P>
      <P>Many local authorities have area committees made up of elected members to deal with matters related to roads, physical planning and similar issues. These committees will continue as before. However, as part of the implementation of the report of the task force on the integration of local government and local development systems, the area committee membership will be expanded to include representatives of the community and voluntary sector when dealing with community development and for the purpose of the area's contribution to the proposed county-city strategy on economic, social and cultural development. It is envisaged that the area committees, as expanded, will come into operation following the local elections next June.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the Deputy is referring to people who, while resident in Ireland, are in receipt of social security pensions paid by institutions outside the State.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the living alone allowance of £6 per week is to recognise the extra cost of living alone.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the integration of the tax and social welfare systems was examined in detail by an expert working group which reported in 1996. The expert group's report set out comprehensively the poverty traps and work disincentives in the present tax and social welfare systems, reviewed a number of possible approaches to reform and set out priorities for future development of the system.</P>
      <P>Having examined options for total integration of the tax and social welfare systems, the group concluded that total integration of the two systems was not the most appropriate way forward, but that greater co-ordination between the two systems was needed. The two key priorities identified by the group were: reform of child income support and tax reform. Both of these issues are being actively tackled by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards reform of child income support, since coming into office I have given particular priority to the reform of family income sup<Col N="1005" /> plement. The 1998 budget provided for the reform of the scheme so that entitlement is now calculated on a net income basis rather than on gross income, as was previously the case. This measure was introduced with effect from 1 October 1998. In addition, the income thresholds were increased by £7 per week with effect from June 1998. The 1999 budget includes provision for a further increase in the income thresholds of £8 per week with effect from June 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have continued the policy of focusing on increasing child benefit as opposed to the child dependant allowances paid with social welfare payments. Since child benefit is paid to all families, regardless of income or employment status, it does not affect the incentive to work. The policy of increasing the role of child benefit, relative to child dependant allowances, has helped to improve incentives to work.</P>
    <P>The second priority identified by the group was the need to pay particular attention to the taxation of people on low incomes. This Government has already made considerable progress on reducing the tax burden. In particular I would remind the Deputy of the tax changes announced in the December budget by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The budget provided for a substantial increase in personal tax allowances of £1,050 for a single person and £2,100 for a married couple. Furthermore, the standard rating of personal and PAYE allowances means that the value of this increase, and indeed any future increases, will be concentrated on those in lower and middle income groups.   </P>
    <P>Dependent spouses are provided for in the social welfare system through the payment of qualified adult allowances where their spouses or partners are in receipt of a social welfare payment. Such allowances are payable under nearly all the schemes operated by my Department. The qualified adult allowance is paid at about 60 per cent of the full personal rate, which is in line with the 1986 recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, and is designed to reflect the fact that it is considered that there are economies of scale where two people are living together.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group, chaired by my Department, is currently examining the treatment of different types of households under both the social welfare and tax systems. The group is, among other things, charged with identifying and costing ways of ensuring consistent and equitable treatment of different types of households including married, co-habiting and one-parent households under both systems. The establishment of this group also marks the first stage in meeting the commitment in the national anti-poverty strategy to examine the individualisation of social welfare payments. The group will complete its work in the next few months and we must await the report to see what measures are proposed before deciding on further action.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of opportunities for dependent spouses the position is that in <Col N="1006" /> accordance with a commitment given in Partnership 2000 a working group has been established to review the question of access by women to labour market opportunities. This group is due to report later this year.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The SWA scheme provides basic weekly payments, rent, mortgage interest and other supplements and once off exceptional need payments, for example, for clothing and footwear. The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has no record of an application from the child's aunt seeking financial assistance. The health board has advised that the mother of the child concerned is in receipt of a qualified child allowance for the child on her widow's pension. She is also in receipt of child benefit.</P>
      <P>It is open to the child's aunt to contact the local community welfare officer to make an application for assistance under the SWA scheme by calling to the Gorey Health Centre any Tuesday between 10.30 a.m. and 12.00 p.m. or by telephoning (055) 21374. On receipt of the application, the CWO will then be in a position to make a decision on the matter and advise on any other options which may be available to the persons concerned.</P>

      <Quest>if butter vouchers will be issued to senior citizens in 1999; the reason the increase in the pension of a senior citizen will not be payable until June 1999; the plans, if any, he has to increase the fuel allowance for pensioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The butter voucher scheme is an EU scheme which my Department administers on behalf of the Department of Agriculture and Food. Its continued operation is subject to periodic review by the EU Council of Ministers which agreed, in December last, to its extension for another 12 months with a reduced budget. As a result vouchers, from January 1999, entitle the beneficiary to a reduction of 36p on the cost of one pound of Irish creamery butter each month. The butter vouchers for this purpose are being printed and issued and all eligible customers should receive their vouchers before the end of March 1999. The numbers who will benefit comprise some 527,000 social assistance beneficiaries, including senior citizens, and some 414,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme is intended to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health board payments who are unable to meet their own heating needs. Information from the fuel and light component of the consumer price index indicates that fuel prices have fallen slightly in the last two years. Any increase in the rate of fuel allowance payable would have significant cost implications and, in any event, improvements in the rate payable cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments ranging between <Col N="1008" /> £3 and £6 per week were announced in the recent budget. These increases, costing almost £206 million on a full year basis, will take effect from the beginning of June 1999 &ndash; the same week as last year. The cost of bringing forward the budget increases in weekly payment would amount to approximately £4 million per week.</P>
    <P>The question of future increases in the fuel allowance and in social welfare payments generally, together with the effective dates of those increases, are matters to be decided in a budgetary context having regard to the available resources and in the light of the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>The allocation provided to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to assist with the provision of marriage, child and bereavement counselling services is primarily intended to support voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling and child counselling services in relation to parental separation. This year the Government have provided £2.1 million for the scheme of grants. The scheme does not cover the provision of counselling to families of persons reported missing.</P>
      <P>Last year I secured sanction to extend the scheme to include the provision of marriage preparation courses and bereavement counselling and support services on the death of a family member. A total of £230,000 was made available in 1998 to organisations providing these services. Loved Ones of Sea Tragedies, which provides support to those who have lost a family member at sea, received £3,500 under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I will be formally launching the scheme of grants for this year on Monday next in Dublin Castle and the grants will be advertised in the national and provincial press tomorrow, 4 March 1999. Application forms and further information are available from the family affairs unit of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts; Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the delay in replying to the Deputy's representations in this case. The position is that my Department is primarily concerned with sites and monuments of the pre-1700 period, and the funding made available to me for any given year is primarily directed towards such properties in State care. With regard to the old school in question, it is a 19th century building which does not enjoy the protection of the National Monuments Acts and it would appear, therefore, that the best approach to securing its protection would be through the local authority. The Deputy will be aware that post-1700 properties may be listed for preservation under a county development plan, and the effect of such a measure would be that planning permission would have to be obtained from the local authority for any proposed building works &ndash; including demolition, changes of use, or alterations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced a package of measures for the protection of the architectural heritage in May 1998. Among these measures is the establishment of a new grant aid scheme for approved conservation works to listed buildings which will commence very soon. The new grants scheme will be administered by the local authorities. It will have funding of £4 million per annum and will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards drawn up by an advisory group made up of our two Departments and the Heritage Council.</P>
      <P>I should also inform the Deputy that another source of potential funding for private heritage projects is the Heritage Council, which is a statutory autonomous body established under the Heritage Act, 1995. Under this Act, the council has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the built heritage. In this regard, I would point out that, while I provide operational funding to the Heritage Council under my Department's Vote, I have no function in relation to the council's decisions on the disbursement of funds.</P>
      <P>In summary, while my Department would have no direct function in addressing the case of the old school in question, I would hope that the foregoing information will be of some assistance to the local community in their endeavours to retain and make use of the building. I would like to assure the Deputy, however, that Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, will be prepared, if requested, to provide technical advice regarding materials to be used, design layout, architectural history of the building etc. together with general architectural advice.</P>

The transfer is in accordance with the Govern<Col N="1012" /> ment decision of 26 July 1995, which accepted the recommendations submitted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in regard to the Dublin Transportation Initiative Plan for Dublin. This plan recommended, among other traffic management initiatives, the appointment of a director of traffic by Dublin Corporation to take over responsibility from the Garda Commissioner for the traffic services in the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
      <P>I should also explain that following prolonged and intensive negotiations under the PCW pay agreement, proposals were put to the unions representing the traffic wardens by both my Department and Dublin Corporation in December 1998. My Department's proposals included an offer of a pay increase while proposals by Dublin Corporation included enhanced pay and conditions on transfer to the corporation over and above what they enjoy at present. The traffic wardens, however, failed to ballot on these proposals, as they required clarification on the proposals put forward by the corporation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give the clarifications sought by the traffic wardens as these are matters solely for Dublin Corporation as their future employer.</P>

    <P>The issue of prison overtime is being addressed on a day to day management basis, and also through the implementation of productivity measures agreed with the Prison Officers' Association under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work  and through the work of a dedicated staffing review team. The aim is to reduce the overall level of overtime payments on the level of overtime earnings in individual cases as it has to be recognised that the present situation, as disclosed by the figures just quoted, is certainly unsatisfactory and has been unsatisfactory for many years.</P>

      <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that the Land Registry will do everything possible to expedite the resolution of this application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 153, 154 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board currently operates 30 full-time law centres around the country with seven in Dublin, two in Cork and one in each of the remaining counties apart from countries Carlow, Roscommon and Leitrim. The board also operates 14 part-time law centres, including part-time law centres located in Carlow town, Boyle, County Roscommon and Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim. New full-time law centres were last opened in January 1997 at Tullamore, County Offaly and Newbridge, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>When the Newbridge law centre opened it had a complement of one solicitor. In July 1998 I sanctioned a second permanent solicitor post. The board also informs me that as part of its ongoing review of law centres it proposes to appoint an additional temporary solicitor to Newbridge in the near future. This should have a positive impact on waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and when, for whatever reason, they become excessive, appropriate remedial action is taken where possible. The increase in waiting times at the board's law centres, including the law centre at Newbridge, is attributable to a significant degree to the continuing increase in the level of demand on the board's services arising from the introduction in recent years of additional family law legislation, including the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996. In the calendar year of 1997, the Legal Aid Board provided legal services to 13,805 people. In that year the number of legally aided cases, that is, cases requiring representation in court, increased from 4,460 to 6,021, an increase of 35 per cent over the previous year. This was <Col N="1015" /> the seventh successive year in which there was an increase in the level of service provided by the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>Since June 1997 I have sanctioned eight solicitor posts and 15 administrative posts for law centres. In consultation with the Legal Aid Board I also continually monitor the position with regard to waiting times at the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board. I am aware that waiting times in some law centres are continuing to increase notwithstanding the allocation of significant additional resources to the board. It is because of this that in December 1997 I sanctioned three solicitor and three clerical posts for the Legal Aid Board on a nine month contract basis. Subsequently in July 1998 I approved 25 additional posts for the Legal Aid Board. Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, are for law centres to help deal with the extended waiting lists at some of the law centres. I also made permanent six temporary posts, three relief solicitors and three clerical staff, and approved the engagement on a temporary basis of a librarian for head office.</P>
    <P>In addition, in order to assist to combat the increase in waiting times I made extra financial resources available to the Legal Aid Board in 1998 and again in 1999. I increased the grant-in-aid by 15 per cent in 1998 to £9.615 million and I am further increasing the allocation this year to £11.953 million, an increase of 25 per cent on 1998. A further allocation of £1 million is being allocated for legal services for asylum seekers bringing the total current allocation to £12.953 million, an increase of 34 per cent over last year.</P>
    <P>The board is independent in the exercise of its functions and, therefore, is responsible for determining policy in relation to processing of applications, waiting and consultation time. Nonetheless, at all times I have been determined to ensure that the Legal Aid Board has the capacity to respond quickly to meet particular needs. In this regard I am happy to say that the board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, child care and child abduction. A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the additional financial resources allocated to the board for 1999, together with the additional staff being recruited by the Legal Aid Board, will impact significantly on waiting times at the board's law centres. I will, however, continue to monitor the waiting times at the law centres and at all times provide assistance to the board in fulfilling its mandate subject to budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Legal Aid Board has operated a private practitioner scheme in Dublin on a pilot basis for the past number of years. The board informs me that it hopes to extend this scheme on a nationwide basis in the near future. The scheme should also assist in the reduction of waiting times at law centres.</P>

Unfortunately, despite intensive inquiries, the Garda has not obtained sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution being taken against any persons for these atrocities. The Garda file on the bombings remains open, and if any new lead should emerge which might bring the culprits to justice, it will be rigorously pursued.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arising from a recommendation in the first report of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, a national drug strategy team was set up, as a cross-departmental team of the type envisaged in the strategic management initiative, to co-ordinate a central response to the drug problem. The report recommended that the team should comprise personnel from relevant Departments and agencies, as well as members from voluntary and community sectors, with a background in dealing with the drug problem.</P>
      <P>On this basis, representatives from the following Departments/agencies were nominated to the team: Health: Taoiseach &ndash; responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy subsequently transferred to Tourism, Sport and Recreation; Justice; Education; Environment; Garda Síochána; Eastern Health Board; and FÁS.</P>
      <P>In addition, two persons, with extensive experience in voluntary-community work in the drugs area, were appointed to the team.</P>
      <P>The Cork drugs task force subsequently proposed to me that one of its members should be appointed to the national drugs strategy team to give a geographic balance to the team. However, as representation is based on a sectoral rather than geographic basis, in keeping with the recommendations of the ministerial task force, and as there were no current vacancies in respect of the above sectors, I informed the task force that I did not propose to appoint any further members to the team at that time.  </P>

      <P>The teacher-counsellor pilot project was established in 1995 in 31 schools in response to representations which were made by principal teachers regarding the education of a small number of pupils in their schools whose behaviour was disruptive and-or disturbed. Twenty seven teachers were deployed in schools in Tallaght/North Clondalkin and in the North Dublin inner city to support the particular pupils. The teachers' work was also intended to benefit the other pupils whose education was being interrupted and school atmosphere generally. This service was provided as an addition to the other school resources, including remedial teaching, to meet the needs of a small targeted cohort of pupils with a particular difficulty. The schools on their part were to develop policies and strategies for behavioural management.</P>
      <P>The project was evaluated in 1998 by members of the inspectorate in my Department. Some aspects of the reports recommendations are still under consideration in my Department and it is my intention that it will be made available to the project schools and other interested parties in the near future. The project was found to be meeting its main objectives though significant areas were identified as requiring further attention.</P>
      <P>As evidence of my support for the service being provided for the specific pupils and for the school generally through the project, I decided that the project should continue in the original schools in the current school year. I also decided to extend the project to ten additional schools from last September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project name was changed to the support teacher project because this title reflects more accurately the qualifications of the persons deployed on the project work and is more closely descriptive of the work that is now within their <Col N="1020" /> remit. The project workers are fully qualified primary teachers and their task is to support the holistic development of young people who are experiencing difficulties in their lives and in learning in school which are expressed in disruptive, disturbed and withdrawn behaviours. Those pupils who are in need of counselling services must be referred to appropriately qualified persons.</P>

However, I understand that the health service employers agency has established a number of expert groups to examine issues relating to the paramedic profession, which would include consideration of the adequacy of graduate output and training arrangements. These groups were established in 1997 and have not as yet reported.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>My priority at present is to ensure that the remedial teacher service is extended to all schools which are currently without a service. My Department is arranging this extension of service which will come into effect from September next.</P>
      <P>Of the schools mentioned by the Deputy, I understand that Tullow boys national school; Tullow girls national school; Conahy national school, Ballyragget boys national school; and Ballyragget girls national school, already have access to a remedial service. The needs of these schools will be considered in the event of additional resources becoming available to improve existing remedial services.</P>
      <P>The remaining schools mentioned by the Deputy will be included in the extension of the remedial service from September next.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give an up to date report on a person (details supplied) in Carlow who is still out of school due to the fact that no place can be found for him in local schools; and if his Department will insist on his old school taking him back if only on a trial period to prove himself.</Quest>

      <P>My Department's psychological service is actively involved in this case and every effort is being made to secure a suitable educational placement at the earliest possible date. However, my Department is not in a position to compel schools to accept individual pupils for enrolment.</P>
