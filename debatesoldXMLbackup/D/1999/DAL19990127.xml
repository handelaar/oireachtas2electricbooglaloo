    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 17 together.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my Dáil statement of 17 December, I travelled to Germany on 15 December to meet with the new German Chancellor, Mr. Gerhard Schröder. We discussed a wide range of issues during our meeting, including bilateral relations, the Northern Ireland peace process, the retention of duty free sales and issues to be addressed during Germany's Presidency of the European Union. The primary focus of our discussions, however, was how the key issues under Agenda 2000, as considered at the Vienna European Council on 11 and 12 December, might be progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my meeting with Chancellor Schröder, I wrote to him on 18 December about duty free sales. This letter sought to build on the progress made at the Vienna European Council which re-opened the possibility of an extension for duty free sales. I also wrote on similar terms to Prime Minister Blair, President Chirac, Prime <Col N="4" /> Minister Jospin and Prime Minister Aznar on this matter. In essence, these letters called for a common approach to the President of the European Commission seeking an extension of duty free sales beyond the end of June.</P>
    <P>My visit to the Middle East, from 17 to 21 January, had three main objectives: to strengthen our already strong bilateral relations with Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Authority; to add my voice to those who are supporting peace in the region; and to acknowledge the significant contribution that members of the Irish Defence Forces have made to peace in the area for more than 20 years. I believe the visit was highly successful in all respects.</P>
    <P>During the course of my visit, I met the Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr. Salim Al-Hoss, on Monday, 18 January, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the former Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Shimon Peres, on Tuesday, 19 January, the Israeli President, Mr. Ezer Weizman, on Wednesday, 20 January, the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Yasser Arafat, on Wednesday, 20 January and members of the Palestinian Legislative Council in Gaza on Thursday, 21 January.</P>
    <P>At my meeting with the Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr. Salim Al-Hoss, we discussed bilateral political and economic relations, Ireland's participation in UNIFIL since its inception in 1978, EU relations with Lebanon and the Middle East peace process.</P>
    <P>While in Lebanon, I also travelled to Qana to visit the memorial to the victims of Israeli shelling and visited the UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura before travelling to Tibnin and the Irish battalion headquarters, Camp Shamrock. I met many Irish Defence Forces personnel currently on duty in Lebanon and toured some of the UNIFIL outposts with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, where I experienced at first hand the day to day conditions and situations faced by our troops.</P>
    <P>My visit to Camp Shamrock afforded an ideal opportunity to see the difference the presence of our soldiers has made to the region and to the people who live there, both in their role as peacekeepers and their contribution to providing humanitarian aid. I was delighted to have the opportunity to visit Tibnin orphanage which cares for 70 children and is supported by the Irish battalion. I travelled to Israel on Tuesday, 19 January where I met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We discussed a number of issues during our lengthy meeting, including the Middle East peace process, bilateral relations, EU-Israel relations and the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    <P>I confirmed to the Prime Minister that we, in common with our EU partners and the Israeli and Palestinian people, would like to see a resumption of the implementation by all sides of the Wye River Agreement, without the introduction of new conditions. I reaffirmed the commitment of the Irish Government to support and encourage all those seeking peace. Although there are sig<Col N="5" /> nificant differences between the situation in the Middle East and that in Northern Ireland, I drew parallels with what had been achieved in the Northern Ireland peace process as a result of the willingness of all the participants to talk to, and negotiate with, the parties involved in the dispute.</P>
    <P>I also met with the EU Special Envoy Ambassador Moratinos during my visit to east Jerusalem. On Wednesday, 20 January I flew on the Government jet to Gaza for talks with the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Yasser Arafat. I am delighted to inform the House that I was the first EU leader to have the opportunity to fly from Israel directly into Gaza Airport.</P>
    <P>President Arafat and I had an excellent and in-depth discussion on the progress achieved with the Wye River Agreement and its importance in finding an acceptable and lasting solution to the situation in the Middle East. I congratulated President Arafat on the role he played in the negotiations and he briefed me on the current state of the peace process. I briefed President Arafat on my meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and again reaffirmed the support of the Irish Government to see that the momentum generated by the Wye River Agreement is not lost.</P>
    <P>During the course of my Middle East visit I raised our candidature for membership of the United Nations Security Council for the two year term 2001 to 2002 at my political level meetings and this was received positively by all sides.</P>
    <P>On Thursday, 22 January I met with United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan. We had a very useful discussion on a wide range of topics, including Ireland's contribution to the work of the UN, human rights issues, disarmament initiatives and UN reform. Foremost in our discussions was peacekeeping. Ireland now ranks seventh among UN nations as a contributor of personnel to UN peacekeeping operations. The Secretary General was very appreciative of our contribution and commented favourably on his visit to the UN training school in the Curragh. I acknowledged the serious financial difficulties which the UN is dealing with at present and I noted the improvement in relation to the question of arrears owed by the UN in respect of peacekeeping costs since the Secretary General took office.</P>
    <P>Ireland's voluntary contributions in support of UN development and relief activities have increased more than threefold in the past five years. I reiterated my commitment to continue to direct most of our voluntary contributions to the UN agency core programmes, in the knowledge that these funds are directed at the poorest and least developed countries.</P>
    <P>We also discussed human rights. Ireland is a member of the UN Commission on Human Rights and our objective is to maintain and, if possible, strengthen our contribution to international efforts to promote and protect human rights. We also discussed disarmament, an area in which Ireland's commitment is long-standing and <Col N="6" /> well known. We spoke about the New Agenda initiative on nuclear disarmament which Ireland, together with seven other nations, launched last June. We shared our views on progress towards the total banning of landmines and work in the EU to control small arms exports.</P>
    <P>I commended the Secretary General on his efforts in pursuit of UN reform and sought his views on what might be achieved over the next year. He expressed his appreciation for Ireland's contribution to the search for a consensus on contentious issues of reform of the UN and the Security Council.</P>
    <P>I briefed the Secretary General on my visit to the Middle East. I also raised our concerns about Kosovo, in particular about the massacre at Racak. In our discussion about Angola, I paid tribute to the work of the UN there and expressed my concern and regret that the two sides have reverted to civil war, with its unacceptable costs for the civilian population. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has pursued our concerns about Kosovo with EU partners over recent weeks and did so again at last Monday's meeting of the General Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>In relation to my diary commitments, I met the Maltese Prime Minister, Dr. Edward Fenech Adami, and Foreign Minister de Marco earlier today. I expect to attend four EU Heads of Government meetings during the German Presidency of the European Union: the informal European Council, devoted primarily to Agenda 2000, provisionally scheduled for 26 February; the special European Council meeting on Agenda 2000 in Berlin on 24 and 25 March; the European Council meeting on the German Presidency on 3 and 4 June in Cologne; and the EU-Latin American Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 28 and 29 June.</P>
    <P>In advance of the proposed informal Council meeting on 26 February there are scheduled meetings with Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark on 4 February; President Chirac and Prime Minister Jospin in Paris on 15 February; and the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Wim Kok, in the Hague on 17 February. I will travel to America on 11 March for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations. On 15 April I will travel to London for an address to the University of North London.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not help noticing the extent of the Taoiseach's schedule. Even his colleague beside him was exhausted by the sound of all he is doing. I hope the Taoiseach is taking his vitamin tablets if he wants to fulfil all that he has outlined.</P>
      <P>Because 17 questions are being taken I hope we will be allowed an opportunity to come back to questions. It will be impossible to ask supplementary questions on everything in one go. Has the Taoiseach had replies to the letters he sent to the people he listed with regard to duty free? The letters were sent over a month ago. If he has not had replies, does he intend to follow up the matter in view of the fact that June 1999 is the deadline for the ending of duty free?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" /> On his meeting with Chancellor Schröder, will the Taoiseach agree that the information that Germany was to withdraw its nuclear waste contract with Sellafield would have been very helpful to Ireland? It now appears that contract will be left in place. It would surely shorten the life of Sellafield if Germany withdrew such a large contract. Did the Taoiseach raise this matter and does he intend to raise it again with Mr. Schröder?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for her concern. I did not raise the issue with Chancellor Schröder at the last meeting. Withdrawal of the contract would be helpful to Ireland and would be a devastating blow to Sellafield. I will raise that matter in the future. I do not know the position of the Chancellor or his Administration on this matter other than what has been said publicly.</P>
      <P>The matter of duty free is being followed up directly. The Minister for Public Enterprise will have a round table meeting in France tomorrow with the French at which the common approach to what we are endeavouring to do will be further pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Apropos the Taoiseach's timetable, which is exhaustive, I hope he gets the opportunity to fulfil it and that events do not intervene between now and the end of June.</P>
      <P>With regard to the duty free issue, have the Commission and the ECOFIN Council completed their study of the impact which the abolition of duty free next June would have on employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, that will not be completed until the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that, until such work is completed, there will be no estimate as to whether the phasing out or postponement of the termination will take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume no final decision will be made, but discussions are ongoing within the Commission. I do not know what the outcome of those discussions is likely to be. From speaking to President Santer prior to Christmas, I know that his officials are following through on what happened at the meeting on 11 December. Although the Commission will probably follow its more conservative line rather than that urged by certain countries in December, the matter is not over yet. There is growing pressure on the Commission to do something in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the relevance of the meeting in France about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to abide by the ruling. I would like to have asked a follow up question.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not changed the subject of his question and I will let him follow up on it briefly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief. What is the relevance of the meeting in France?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a round table meeting which the French Prime Minister and the Transport Minister will attend. Efforts are being made by the Prime Ministers mentioned to reach a common position on what we want the Commission to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not help the Minister for Public Enterprise if she knew the replies to the five or six letters sent on 18 December to the Prime Ministers? That is crucial information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The letters urged that we work together and everyone has agreed to co-operate. Tomorrow's meeting is part of the process. The Germans have been active in the matter. It is a question of reaching a common position to secure the agreement of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that he did not raise the matter of the German decision on nuclear waste with Chancellor Schröder. Will he raise it, now that the Germans have rowed back from it? In his meeting with Kofi Annan at which he reaffirmed Ireland's commitment to the United Nations, did the Taoiseach raise the matter of the United States' debt to the United Nations which is having a crippling effect on its peacekeeping activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed the matter of finances with Kofi Annan and the outstanding debts of the United Nations to this country. The Secretary General outlined what he is seeking to do in this area and the contributions he is seeking to secure from the richer countries. He is well aware of the difficulties being created. It is a question of resources. He has made considerable progress since his appointment two years ago. It is a matter of regret to him that some of the wealthier nations are not contributing to the extent they should. I did not raise the matter of Sellafield with Chancellor Schröder whom I am not due to meet for some time. The relevant Minister and Minister of State will follow up the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach have an exchange of views with the German Chancellor on the question of corporation tax harmonisation? What steps are being taken by European Heads of Government to prepare for the possibility of further genocide in Kosovo? Has consideration been given to a role for Partnership for Peace in the region? On the weekend the Taoiseach visited the Lebanon the United Nations convention on the protection of UN personnel serving abroad became part of international law when New Zealand became the 22nd country to sign it. Does the Taoiseach agree that it is outrageous that attacks on UNIFIL which he visited can be pursued under international law in 22 states but not in Ireland? What explanation can <Col N="9" /> he offer for the failure to ratify the convention, a matter I have raised week in, week out since the Government took office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Kosovo was discussed by the General Affairs Council, and there are questions on that matter tabled to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He outlined our position at some length, describing our determination to assist with progress on this matter at EU level. Deputy Mitchell will be aware that this situation is still very grave, and I am not aware of the outcome of Monday's meeting. For the last number of weeks the Minister for Foreign Affairs has kept a close eye on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have already answered the Deputy on the ratification of the UNIFIL decision; we intend to ratify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I again raised our view of the Commissioner's efforts to harmonise taxes. I put it in the context that we agreed with the examination of what is going on as we work towards a transparent tax system. The idea of integrating towards a single rate is something we oppose, and it was decided to move rapidly away from that following the last European Council meeting. Now, under Commissioner Monti, an examination of different corporate tax regimes in all member states is taking place. The transparency of those systems is also being examined, as different methods are used in different countries for agreements with companies. That matter has been raised by many member states. Ours is a straight line transparent system and we have defended it in all respects. I defended it at my meeting with the Chancellor, Mr. Schröder.</P>

      <P>During the Taoiseach's visit to the Middle East did he raise the issue of the demolition by the Israeli authorities of Palestinian homes, which is going on to this day? Did he raise with the Israeli authorities the issue of a safe route between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip? That was guaranteed under the peace agreement.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa. I raised the issue of the homes during a long discussion with the Minister for Defence. The discussion was heated as the Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, first declined to accept that it was an <Col N="10" /> issue at all. He finally stated that it covered perhaps 1.5 per cent of the territory. We disputed that. It may be 1.5 per cent of the total territory, but it is a very high percentage of the territory involved. We argued the logic of the situation at that and other meetings, and we got clear explanations of the situation. I feel this is a numbers game in the region regarding who is on what register. Mr. Netanyahu claims he is within his rights, while the Palestinian leader, Mr. Arafat, and other Palestinian leaders I met in east Jerusalem would hotly dispute that. It goes to the centre of the issue and is a matter of huge conflict and enormous disruption. It is everybody's view regarding the West Bank and Gaza Strip region that if the Wye River Agreement is to work, those will be the most contentious areas for discussion. I made this view clear to Mr. Netanyahu. However, it is unlikely this matter will progress much this side of their election on 17 May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions, one of which relates to what he has said. Will he confirm if discussion took place about the oppressive Israeli action at the borders when citizens of Gaza have to cross into Israel daily in the morning and return in the evening? They have to go through an oppressive regime of checking and sometimes are left waiting for hours on end. That does not affect only citizens of Gaza but development aid workers who work in Gaza. Did that issue come up? As a sign of bona fide intent, did the Israeli Government give an assurance that some of that oppressiveness would be lifted from the border posts?</P>
      <P>At the meetings the Taoiseach had with EU Heads of State, did he raise the problem that has arisen for Ireland with regard to tax designation for the International Financial Services Centre at the Custom House Docks? When he was Minister for Finance it appeared the EU did not approve of such a designation. Did he raise that question during his discussions with other Prime Ministers in order to gain support for such approval at EU level? If not, does he intend to raise it at future meetings with his counterparts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to tax matters, they are all being pursued under various categories by the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance and this has been ongoing for the past 12 months. There has been progress in some areas, but there are ongoing investigations and action has been taken by the Commission in other areas. It will be some months before they are all resolved. Some matters have been resolved and others will be resolved fairly quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen is correct in stating there are major difficulties in relation to border stops between Gaza and Israel. There has been no resolution of this issue. Gaza residents crossing the border to go to work are delayed for hours every day. Sometimes they get through without difficulty, but other times they do not. I called to the offices of the UN staff where I met development <Col N="11" /> aid workers. The position has improved for them, but they feel rather guilty about that. They are segregated from the other citizens and let through fairly quickly. This position is not satisfactory because they are living and working with those citizens and such segregation is occurring every day. We raised this issue. I hope all these matters will be part of an overall settlement. There was no indication that anything other than a hard line will be taken in the short term to deal with these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions on EU matters arising from his replies. Did the German Chancellor, Mr. Schröder, raise with him the question of German unhappiness about the scale of their contribution to the EU budget? If so, what response, if any, did he give? </P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The German contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The Taoiseach indicated in his reply he will attend four EU Heads of Government meetings, the first of which will take place on 26 February and which could be correctly described as a dress rehearsal for the March meeting on Agenda 2000. Will the Taoiseach indicate what preparations have been made by the Government for that meeting and whether it is intended to submit to Brussels prior to 26 February a position on what the Government is seeking? Will the House have an opportunity to debate or have sight of the Government's position prior to 26 February?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat my question. This is part of the problem that arises from taking 17 diverse questions together. On EU matters, during his meeting with the German Chancellor, did the German Chancellor raise with the Taoiseach German concerns about the scale of their contribution towards the European Union budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. He made it very clear, as he has in all interviews, that there must be a change in the contribution mechanism because Germany will not continue to pay the scale of contribution it has paid in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is adamant that the 1.27 per cent of GNP rate of contribution is adequate for enlargement &ndash; the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo; and the &ldquo;ins&rdquo;&ndash; over the next couple of years. He also believes the present rate of take-up of the contribution, which is approximately 1.01 per cent of GNP, is adequate. I do not think there is a possibility of the Chancellor changing his view that there will be a reduction in the over<Col N="12" /> all German contribution. There are two reasons for that &ndash; first, it is his domestic agenda, as he made clear in his election campaign and since and, second, like Ireland, he is in favour of enlargement and wants to ensure that as new member states go through the accession process there will be adequate resources for them. He will not change from that position and we will have to negotiate around that.</P>
    <P>That leads to the second question. In the last number of weeks we have been actively involved, both in the Government and in the Ministers and Secretaries group, in preparing for the first meeting at the end of February. We also have a Cabinet subcommittee working with technical people from key Departments &ndash; one person from each Department &ndash; to ensure we put our case together. I do not see this House debating the first round of submissions because at that stage everyone will be sounding out positions to determine the parameters. I do not think people will show their hands at the February meeting, the idea will be to get an indication of the negotiating strategy. Everyone is being asked by the Germans not to continue asking for everything they want, but to prioritise and we will have to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true, as I heard the Taoiseach say, that he is keen the Germans understand Ireland's position on nuclear storage at Sellafield? Given his good working relationship with Herr Schröder will he, as leader of our Government, make clear to the German Government our position and our wish that it follows through on its policy commitment on storage of nuclear waste, rather than send it to Sellafield?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Ministers are doing their jobs but I ask him to take that step also.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach acknowledges that Mr. Kofi Annan has done a lot of work to resolve the UN's funding problems. Has he established the deadlines by which Ireland will be repaid money owing for peacekeeping or is there joint action, which he or others have suggested to the Secretary-General, by which the United States can begin to repay, even on a phased basis? When might that be done so that UN peacekeeping work can proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, I will do that but it will be some time before I am likely to have an opportunity because the February meeting is about only Agenda 2000. However, if I do get the opportunity I will take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some £7.2 million is owed to Ireland in respect of peacekeeping costs, but under the reign of the current Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, the position has improved dramatically &ndash; more than £5 million in arrears has been paid over the last 18 months. As I said earlier, the Secretary-General assured me he is endeavouring to reach a res<Col N="13" /> olution with those countries which are not making significant payments. He is acutely conscious that the problem lies there and he is making his best efforts to tackle it. The difficulty for him is that what people say and do are often different.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> On the Taoiseach's meeting with Herr Gerhard Schröder and his future meetings with the EU leaders, has he discussed with them, or is it on the agenda for discussion, the prospects for the European economy in 1999 against widespread forecasts of a recession developing in the EU? Growth in Germany is projected at 1.4 per cent and a miserable 1.25 per cent in the euro zone as a whole. That brings the danger of more unemployment and pressure to cut public spending. Is there concern among EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, about where this would lead the whole EU project, which was about employment and economic stability?</P>
      <P>With the prospect of a developing recession, when both political and economic conditions will begin to diverge very markedly within the EU, do the Taoiseach and the EU leaders with whom he has been discussing this see a real problem with a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; monetary policy? There is a question mark over changing to a one currency economy within the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions of that nature are fundamental to the meetings of the European Council, at which economic growth and employment performance is always discussed. Everything that has happened on the employment pact has been relatively positive. It is not always as good in all European countries as it has been in this country in recent years, but the work of member states is always directed at trying to remove the barriers, obstacles and impediments and to allow economic growth to increase, particularly employment growth. Ten years ago not as much direct action was taken at European Council meetings as is taken now in trying to generate employment policies to ensure the citizens of the Community are facilitated and their situations improved.</P>
      <P>In terms of our contribution, our employment policy and input were well received in other countries. Many of the mechanisms we have tried have gained support and interest in other countries. I continue, wherever I can, to put forward our policies to the other EU leaders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I return to the meeting on Agenda 2000 on 26 February. Is the Government's approach to that initial meeting, prior to the proposed definitive meeting in March based on the regionalisation structure that it proposed to EUROSTAT? When will EUROSTAT indicate whether that regionalisation structure is acceptable? Can the Taoiseach indicate if, after 26 February, the indications from all the member states with regard to Agenda 2000 will become avail<Col N="14" /> able, or will it still be a question of shadow boxing right up to March?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think countries will be asked to produce their bottom lines at that meeting and not to continue to raise an enormous number of issues. I hope there will be some understanding on CAP reform and that the issue of own resources will, at least, become a bit clearer than at present. That will not finalise the discussions but it will certainly help.</P>
      <P>There are other very important issues, such as those concerning Cohesion Fund countries. The Germans are still resisting any opportunity to agree to resources for Cohesion Funds for countries in the euro zone. That is a very important issue for us and there has been no movement on it. There is also the issue of the phase-in period for Structural Funds and the question of how long the transitional period will be and whether there will be a mid-term review. I hope those questions will be resolved, which would allow us to get into more substantive discussions.</P>
      <P>There are still very fundamental issues in the Agriculture Council which will affect us greatly, and also the Spanish and the French. The cofinancing of the Common Agriculture Policy is a major issue and it would be enormously costly if it were to be changed. There is some indication that countries are moving on that.</P>
      <P>Matters have been firming up since the beginning of the year. I would like to be able to tell Deputy Quinn that matters will be finalised in February to the extent that would allow orderly discussions to take place in March which would wrap it up. However&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Government's position is based on EUROSTAT approving regionalisation. Given that the Government is running to the wire on this issue, is there a contingency plan if it does not approve?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Given that a decision has not been made, we have costed the figures on the basis of both alternatives. Everybody else has done likewise to ensure that matters will be in order.</P>
      <P>With regard to what will happen at the meeting next March, Deputy Quinn is aware that I attended similar meetings on the last two occasions, in 1989 and 1993. Both meetings went to the wire. That will probably happen again.</P>

Did he also raise the issue of the continued bombing, which has now resulted in acknowledged civilian casualties? Will he express his serious concern to the UN, the US <Col N="15" /> and the UK about this continued aggression against Iraq? Given that we are presiding over what is essentially infanticide in Iraq, did the Taoiseach in his meeting with Mr. Annan raise the issue of how the UN sanctions are impacting on the civilian population, especially on the children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both those issues were discussed. Mr. Kofi Annan gave a detailed account of his assessment of the Iraqi situation, especially his concern about the issue of sanctions. The Deputy is aware that there has been considerable discussion on this at the UN. There has not been a resolution. The issue boils down to two groups, one which believes there should be no change and the other, which reflects the views of Deputy De Rossa and others, which believes that a more humanitarian way of addressing the issue should be developed. When I asked Mr. Annan about the success of an initiative in this regard he advised that he was endeavouring to move. However, despite the agreements he believed he had reached last year, where he thought he could move such issues forward, he has not had much success. He is still trying and is very conscious of the humanitarian aspects, especially with regard to health and the position of children.</P>

      <P>In his meeting with Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, did the Taoiseach discuss with him the fact that the United States owes IR£1 billion to that body? Did Mr. Kofi Annan ask him to use his good offices with the United States President and Congress &ndash; it is a problem for Congress rather than the President &ndash; to try to get some movement on that? Did he discuss with the Secretary General Ireland's attitude to the necessity for the reform of the Security Council of the United Nations which is dominated by the Anglo-American axis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Security Council, I have been briefed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had a long meeting with Mr. Kofi Annan the night before I met him. I reiterated the views of the Minister and the Department on this matter. There is considerable frustration within the UN because many people are making suggestions for useful reforms but are not living up to them. This is making it difficult for the Secretary General to push his reform package. This might not be true in respect of everybody, but Mr. Kofi Annan has completed his reform package, following an internal agenda. That has been a difficult process because he has faced huge financial reductions and many obstacles. On the other side, more powerful states have not moved an inch on issues for which they are responsible. That has made the situation very difficult for the Secretary General.</P>
      <P>In terms of resources, he did not ask us for help with Congress but every opportunity should be taken to raise the issue. Last week, with development aid workers, I saw the extraordinary plight of refugees in one of the camps in Gaza, and there are several camps there &ndash; refugees have been living in these camps since 1948. Because of lack of resources at the UN the health, education and aid budgets are all being drastically cut. Whatever arguments we have about development aid, it seems fair that a country like ours should do its utmost, as it has done over the years, to continue to increase aid. However, some very wealthy countries are not giving proportionately substantial resources. The money owed by the United States is also an issue, but the United States is not the only country creating problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict. All accident and emergency departments experience periods of exceptional demand which can result in delays for patients. However, it is important to note that appropriate medical treatment is provided at all times and that waiting periods are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
      <P>In 1998 I made an additional £2.3 million available for the development of accident and emergency services. This additional money was provided as follows: public education &ndash; a national publication campaign launched by the Eastern Health Board aimed at persuading people with minor ailments to attend their family doctor rather than a hospital accident and emergency department, at a cost of £100,000; initiatives in accident and emergency departments &ndash; the provision of additional senior house officers, registrars, night shift nurses and triage nurses at the Mater Hospital at a cost of £200,000; the provision of increased registrar cover and additional nursing staff at Beaumont Hospital costing £200,000; the introduction of general practitioners, nurse practitioners and registrar to the accident and emergency department at St. James's Hospital at a cost of £200,000; the provision of an emergency medical ward to alleviate pressures on acute beds at St. Vincent's Hospital at a cost of £200,000; the provision of £50,000 each to Galway University Hospital and Cork University Hospital; the provision of £300,000 for 20 additional beds for three months at James Connolly Memorial Hospital; long stay initiatives &ndash; the provision of 40 elderly places at St. Monica's Home at a cost of £600,000 and the provision of 20 day care/step-down places at Crinken Lane and Crooksling at a cost of £200,000; and community initiatives &ndash; the provision of additional community ward teams costing £200,000. The total cost of these measures is £2.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year I provided additional funding of £2 million to enable acute major hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing some of the difficulties being experienced in our accident and emergency departments, particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step-down facilities for patients who occupy beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and <Col N="18" /> improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion. Specifically, this funding of £2 million has been provided for a public education programme &ndash; the continuation by the Eastern Health Board of a public education campaign at a cost of £105,000; initiatives in the accident and emergency departments will include £100,000 for AMiNCH &ndash; Tallaght Hospital will provide for the introduction of measures aimed at reducing pressure from accident and emergency services on acute hospital beds; £200,000 for Beaumont, continuing the physical upgrade to the accident and emergency department and the provision of additional staff; £210,000 to the Mater Hospital towards the conversion of a day unit to provide conventional beds to be utilised to alleviate pressure on the accident and emergency department; £210,000 for St James's Hospital for continued development of rapid diagnostic systems for patients and the creation of a patient discharge waiting area-lounge for patients awaiting transport home, thereby releasing inpatient beds at the earliest opportunity; £210,000 for St Vincent's Hospital to provide for the recruitment of additional staff and the purchase of appropriate care facilities and step-down accommodation for patients who no longer require acute hospital services; £50,000 for the children's hospital, Temple Street, for the provision of additional staff; £50,000 for improved services in the accident and emergency department in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin; £75,000 for the provision of step down facilities at the Incorporated Orthopaedic Hospital, Clontarf; £350,000 for the Western Health Board to improve nursing and medical cover; and £440,000 for the provision of 20 additional acute hospital beds at James Connolly Memorial Hospital during the winter period aimed at reducing pressure from accident and emergency services on acute hospital beds. The total is £2 million.</P>
    <P>I have also published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and I am committed to ensuring its recommended approach is implemented. The report is one of a number of measures which I have taken to address the question of long waiting lists and waiting times. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999, which is a 66 per cent increase on the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997. The report recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of step-down or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care. Accordingly, I have provided extra funding of £9 million in 1999 for services for older people which will be an important factor in help<Col N="19" /> ing to free up acute hospital beds currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available.</P>
    <P>Among other things, the £9 million will be used to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards. There are also a number of chronic sick patients in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of identifying and securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I asked the Minister a question about the difficulties in accident and emergency departments in recent weeks. He apparently thinks it is appropriate to deliver a second stage speech on the running of the health service. Is this not Question Time, Sir, because the Minister has ranged far and wide across a broad range of issues?</P>

      <P>The Chair has no control over the length of the reply from a Minister. As the Deputy will be aware, the system under which the Minister had two minutes for his reply has lapsed and we have reverted back to the old system of dealing with Priority Questions. However, I ask Ministers and Members to be as brief as possible to ensure we get through as many questions as possible at Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this speech on the Estimates before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am giving such detail on this matter is that it has been suggested since the Parliament last met that there was no activity on dealing with the issues arising. I am using the opportunity of the first priority question to outline to the public the detailed work which is going on in all of our hospitals and the extra money which is being provided to deal with the problem. I have already outlined the detailed provision for accident and emergency services. It is clearly the case, and it has been my contention all along, that some of the problems in the accident and emergency services cannot be dealt with in the context of the acute hospital sector alone. Therefore, I am outlining to the Deputy &ndash; perhaps to his embarrassment in view of the greatly increased allocation compared with when he was in Government &ndash; the moneys which are being made available to services for the elderly which <Col N="20" /> will allow people to obtain other sub-acute care facilities in the system so that we can provide better care for people, some of whom had to deal with less than ideal situations in the accident and emergency services in recent weeks. Given that this is a priority question on a matter which has raised much public comment outside the House, it is appropriate for me to deal in detail with the issue in the House, the place to which I am accountable for my actions. I am sorry if the Deputy thought I had no response to give to the question; I have a very detailed response to give to it.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board, where the pressure on accident and emergency services has been greatest, £3.83 million of the additional allocation of £9 million is being allocated by way of £260,000 for home help pay, an extra £504,000 for home help development, an extra £1.25 million for new units, an extra £613,000 for contract beds, an extra £120,000 for voluntary groups, an extra £532,000 for nursing home subventions, an extra £150,000 for geriatricians, an extra £125,000 for carers support, £100,000 for community supports, and an extra £176,000 for other services.</P>
      <P>Exchequer capital spending for 1999 will be £155 million, and the corresponding allocations for next year and 2001 will be £165 million and £205 million, respectively. This three year total for the health capital programme of £525 million represents a significant increase of £216 million, or almost 70 per cent, on the sum of £309 million provided by the previous rainbow Government for the three year period 1995-97 and reflects the Government's recognition that the health capital programme has not been adequately resourced in the past. As a consequence of this increased investment, major capital projects are under way or planned for hospitals such as the Mater and Temple Street hospitals, St James's Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, Naas General Hospital, University College Hospital, Galway, Cork University Hospital, Castlebar General Hospital, Portlaoise General Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital, all of which include the provision of enhanced accident and emergency facilities and support services.</P>
      <P>The increase in demand which has been experienced in accident and emergency departments in recent weeks has resulted in a less than ideal situation for persons presenting for care and treatment. I regret any distress or inconvenience which this may have caused. I am confident, however, that the measures which I have outlined will contribute significantly to ensuring in future that waiting times are kept to an absolute minimum, having regard to the difficulty in predicting attendance patterns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any perception of the public outrage about the chaos which prevailed in accident and emergency departments in a variety of hospitals across the country? Does he acknowledge that during his tenure in office there has been a scandalous lack of long-term planning <Col N="21" /> to address the issue of peak demands on accident and emergency departments? This is the second winter during which the Minister has presided over health matters. Can he explain why he gave pledges in 1997 that difficulties experienced in accident and emergency departments in the winter months in 1997 would not recur in 1998 and why he failed to live up to those pledges?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the huge cutbacks in hospital beds during December in hospitals the length and breadth of this country contributed to the demand on accident and emergency departments in hospitals, placed the staff of those hospitals in an impossible position during December and January, more importantly, caused a great deal of pain, distress and worry to many people who had to attend at accident and emergency departments and placed lives at risk?</P>

      <P>As regards the perception of the problem, if Deputy Shatter and those like him were politically honest, it would be very easy to dispel the perception he has been promulgating for the past three weeks, that the whole system is in a state of crisis. That is a perception which the Deputy, for his own party political advantage, would seek to have people believe. I have the political honesty to come in here to outline the actual situation and say what this Government is doing about it. I am prepared, on the basis of objective facts, to compare the work we are doing to what the Deputy was prepared to do when he supported a Government in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Deputy Shatter's tactic to raise an emotional level of concern to obscure the objective assessment of what is being done, which I have outlined in detail in my reply, compared to what was done by a Government and Minister he supported. I am prepared to allow the people compare what pro-active steps are being taken under this Administration to those taken by his.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that I deal with perceptions. I have no intention of dealing with perceptions. I intend to deal with the realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The activity levels in all our hospitals since I entered office have increased. There is more surgery, more in-patient procedures, more day care procedures, more people being treated in our hospitals than in the history of the State and more resources are going towards ensuring these procedures continue. As regards the symptomatic problems in the accident and emergency services <Col N="22" /> to which the Deputy referred, I have outlined the detailed plan being implemented while the Deputy continues to contend at every opportunity when he sees a microphone, that the health system is in crisis.</P>
    <P>That does a great disservice, not to me as it is a typical and predictable political onslaught from an Opposition which has nothing else to say but to the professionalism and commitment of people in hospitals who are providing an adequate level of service, albeit in some instances in less than ideal circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting we have not experienced weeks of crisis in the health service? Does he regard it as acceptable that an 89 year old woman with pulmonary pneumonia should be on a hospital trolley in a major hospital for 32 hours before she can be provided with a hospital bed? Does he regard it as acceptable that an 11 month old baby with a leg broken in two places should wait in an accident and emergency department for two hours to see a junior doctor, with the parents then being told that no-one could let them know at what time the child might be x-rayed, as a result of which, the parents had to go to another hospital? Is the Minister seriously suggesting that when events of that nature take place in our hospitals, we have a temporary difficulty and that services are adequate? Will the Minister acknowledge the crisis which has been seen by the vast number of people who have attended our hospitals? It is not the fault of hospital staff but of the Minister and his Department for failing to plan for the winter months and for not providing in good time the resources these hospitals need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can list individual cases, of which there are many more than the two listed by him, where people have faced difficulties because of the surging demand on services in the past three weeks. That is not a novel phenomenon and is one which, unfortunately, is present in every advanced health care system which I know of in the western world. If Deputy Shatter says it is possible to devise a health system where that will not occur on any day of the week, at any time of the year, he is being politically dishonest and is saying to the people that he can deliver that level of service when he knows, in his heart and soul, he cannot. If the Deputy wishes to persist with that perception to make himself popular by riding on that kind of politics, I will not play that game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where was the Deputy when he supported a Government which gave less money, provided fewer resources and which did not provide any capital expenditure to improve facilities which he now says are inadequate? People can see the Deputy's motivation, which has nothing to do with improving services. The Deputy may give subjective cases and what he outlined is not ideal, but it happened this year, it unfortunately may happen in the future and it certainly happened in <Col N="23" /> the past. More resources are being provided by this Administration to ensure that fewer of the hard cases to which the Deputy referred occur. I can give no absolute guarantee, as the Deputy certainly cannot, that it might not happen again. The public should be credited with more intelligence than the Deputy is prepared to give it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the logic of what he is telling the House is that he does not regard it as his job to ensure the type of crisis experienced this winter does not recur? Is he aware that the public regard it as his job to ensure this crisis does not recur? Is he aware that when, in a recent broadcast, he spoke about his commitment to the taxpayer in the context of saving money, the majority of people listening were of the view that it is the Minister's job to protect the health of patients and to deliver the medical care which people require to lead a normal life? Will the Minister acknowledge that his fixation with taxation issues at a time when this country is overflowing with money does not do service to those on escalating waiting lists who look to him to do his duty?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not doing a service to the public by coming out with that nonsense. I presume he believes taxpayers are also patients &ndash; has he a problem with that? His argument is based on a totally nonsensical premise. If we are seriously honest with the people, this year we will pay back interest totalling more than £2.5 billion on our national debt. If we had less debt we would not pay as much interest. It would be great if we could contribute £700 million or £800 million pounds of that £2.5 billion to the health service every year&mdash;</P>

People are fed up with the vacuous arguments of people on the opposite side of the House who are not prepared to face up to the realities. The realities are that we have a greater demand on our health services, we need to invest in our facilities and we must be prepared to have a larger capital programme which we did not have under the Deputy's Administration. With the provision of the money referred to in my detailed reply, we have an opportunity to deal with the problems which occur perennially in our health services by putting in place an investment programme in our hospitals and health services generally to improve the situation. We have, in construction and in planning, a far greater number of projects in that respect than was within the capability of the Deputy's predecessor, however well meaning he might have been, who did not get the money from a Labour Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy is currently under investigation by a group of experts nominated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists at the request of the North Eastern Health Board. I understand the group's report is expected by the North Eastern Health Board in a few months. The consultant involved is on administrative leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has arranged for a small number of patients of the consultant in question to be contacted through their general practitioner. The board has also established a helpline to provide advice and assistance to patients and families who have concerns regarding the treatment received. Each call is followed up and appropriate advice, support and counselling is provided as necessary. There is access to a medical social work and to <Col N="25" /> a psychologist for those who wish to discuss any matters further.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that all cases involving individual consultants are a matter for the relevant employer &ndash; in this case a health board &ndash; and it would not be appropriate for me, as Minister, or for my Department to become involved in an ongoing investigation of this nature. However, the North Eastern Health Board has been keeping my Department fully informed of developments.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of clinical audit raised by the Deputy, I fully support its development across all levels of the health service. Under their contractual commitments in public hospitals, consultants are required to participate in a process of clinical audit. My Department is currently engaged with health agencies in putting the structures in place to allow for the implementation of these contractual undertakings. I recently approved the development of an accreditation system for the acute hospital sector, on a pilot basis. I am confident that this system, which would allow hospitals to assess their overall performance against an objectively agreed set of standards, will greatly assist in the development of individual quality improvement measures such as clinical audit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that his rather leisurely approach to this issue is unacceptable when one considers that it is profoundly alarming to women patients who may have undergone procedures by this consultant or who may do so in the future under some other consultant? Will he not agree that an investigation of this type should take a shorter period than the rather open-ended timeframe of a number of months? I remind the Minister we were promised a Green Paper on another issue which we were told would take a couple of months, yet over a year later we have not seen it. Will the Minister accept that he should be in a position at this stage to state clearly when this investigation will be concluded? Will he indicate the status of this investigation? What is the procedure in regard to the outcome of this investigation and what is his role and that of the Department in dealing with what is a profoundly serious life-altering experience for certain female patients? </P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a small number of operations. The number of operations carried out was not small. What does the Minister mean by a small number and why were all the patients not called in for investigation? Were all patients contacted personally and asked if they needed counselling? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give us a serious answer in relation to clinical audit policy. He cannot refer to the previous Government on this issue; the Minister seems to be obsessed with looking at the past. When will clinical audit policy be established in all our hospitals? Does the Minister agree this should be a matter of course to which all consultants should be subject to ensure best <Col N="26" /> practice and to reassure patients that when they finally get through the system they will be treated to the best possible standard in all cases?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Deputy on her promotion. This matter was raised by the Deputy's predecessor &ndash; I commiserate with her on her demotion &ndash; on 15 December last when the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, answered a question on the Adjournment outlining this issue. As has been stated in my reply, it is not a question of being leisurely but of due process taking its course.</P>
      <P>The question relates to a consultant obstetrician. On 22 October last, the employees of a hospital alleged to the legal adviser of the health board concerned that there was an abnormally high caesarean hysterectomy rate. This procedure is only carried out in urgent medical circumstances and is avoided as much as possible since it precludes any further pregnancies. On being informed of the complaint, the health board concerned immediately set about dealing with it. It carried out a preliminary assessment over the weekend of 23-26 October. It met with the consultant on 27 October. He consented at that meeting to submit his practice to peer review conducted by personnel from outside of the board's area. It was subsequently claimed that the complaints against him were groundless. The chief executive officer was presented with reports from three obstetricians acting on behalf of the consultant concerned indicating that his management of a number of cases selected by that consultant were without fault and acceptable. The board referred the cases to a UK consultant obstetrician gynaecologist contacted via a reputable health care risk agency. There was a failure by the consultant to agree initially to the board's proposed approach to reviewing his case by an expert group nominated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists but he subsequently agreed to the terms of reference of this group through his legal advisers on 23 November last. The board received a report from the UK consultant obstetrician gynaecologist on 8 December and, based on that report and a separate complaint received from a patient on the same date, the chief executive officer invoked Appendix 4 of the consultant's contract and instructed the consultant to take immediate administrative leave from 11 December.</P>
      <P>As has been said, the board set up a helpline on 16 December to provide advice and assistance to patients and families with any concerns regarding the treatment received. The helpline has been manned by a medical social worker, an assistant director of nursing and a complaints officer. It received a total of 173 calls between 16 December and 21 January. Each call was followed up with advice, support and necessary counselling. The board has a psychologist available in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of clinical audit, while it is not directly connected to this case the use of clinical audit would clearly help to identify <Col N="27" /> quickly apparently abnormal practice patterns. I agree with the Deputy that it should form part of our system and that is the reason we are introducing it. In recent weeks further complaints have been received from patients and copies of those complaints have been forwarded to the group nominated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The due process is taking its course and I assure the Deputy this matter is being dealt with in a serious way. Far from a leisurely approach being adopted, the facts confirm that upon immediate notification prudent steps were taken by the board to ensure the matter was dealt with appropriately and in a way that will not be open to legal challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state publicly that there is now no problem in relation to any question of liability with regard to the investigating doctors? This issue has been raised on a number of occasions. Will the Minister clarify the situation? What will be the status of this investigation in terms of its outcome and the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children?</P>

      <P>Whatever decisions will be necessary will depend on the outcome of the investigation and the board will consider that as soon as the investigation is complete. The employer relationship is with the board, not the Department.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, there were claims in a medical journal that the inquiry by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists might not proceed because of medical indemnity problems for the three members of the group. However, this was refuted by the health board on 26 January and the review is to proceed as planned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to simply focus on the number of beds available at any given time. This reflects major changes that have been taking place in medical practice, resulting in reduced <Col N="28" /> average in-patient lengths of stay, a continuing shift in the delivery of care from an in-patient to day case basis and the increasing provision of treatment at out-patient level.</P>
      <P> In developing and delivering service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day case and out-patient care is a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity. As part of this process, activity in the acute hospital sector is planned over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures would form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local management as part of their efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave, refurbishment works and the scaling down of elective activity at times of low demand, such as the high summer period and at Christmas. I am confident, however, that, given the level of increased funds I have made available to the acute hospital sector this year over last year, the level of temporary bed closures will be kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>The total number of discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to October 1998 was 676,635 which was an increase of over 3 per cent over the same period in 1997. In other words, irrespective of any temporary bed closures that occurred during that time, over 3 per cent more patients received treatment in our acute hospitals. It is in this context that the performance of acute hospitals in 1998 should be judged. In agreeing service plans for 1999 with agencies in the acute hospital sector, my fundamental concern is to ensure that they will again deliver a level of service to patients commensurate with the funding being provided to them.</P>
      <P>The ability of the acute hospital system to provide treatment to an increased number of patients in 1998 bears out my view that the system is continuing to perform productively. This is also evidenced in a recent OECD comparative study on health expenditure which found that hospital productivity here has increased significantly over the past 15 years. The report found that, over that period, the average in-patient length of stay had reduced by 29 per cent, better management of resources had allowed the average bed occupancy rate to rise to 85 per cent and the level of day care treatment had almost quadrupled since 1986.</P>
      <P>As a result of a combination of these factors, the total number of cases being treated in acute hospitals in Ireland has been rising by 3 per cent each year since 1987, against a background of a reduction of in-patient bed numbers in the late 1980s. This again emphasises the inappropriateness of available bed numbers as an accurate measure of what is happening in the acute hospital sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> While the OECD report makes it clear that the acute hospital system is being managed well, my policy is to ensure that the productivity of the system continues to be optimised to the benefit of patients everywhere. That means ensuring that the system is appropriately resourced to provide high quality services that respond efficiently, effectively and equitably to the needs of the population.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I have provided additional funding of almost £71 million in 1999 to meet the cost of specific acute hospital service developments in areas such as accident and emergency services, cancer services and cardiovascular services, to commission new units completed under the capital programme under which investment is now at a historically high level, to meet costs associated with rising birth rates, to replace medical equipment and to seriously address the problem of unacceptably lengthy waiting times for particular procedures as part of my strategy of implementing the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative. The strategy in the waiting list review group report is a comprehensive one aimed at addressing the problem of hospital waiting lists in a broad based approach which also encompasses the primary health and continuing care dimensions of the problem.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the conflict between available resources and the competing demands for ever increasing expenditure on health and social services. In recognising that, the scale of increase in overall resources devoted to the public health services in 1998 and 1999 reflects the strong commitment of this Government to addressing the genuine needs that exist. In 1999, non-capital expenditure on health will be £3.4 billion, an increase of approximately 10 per cent on the 1998 outturn level when hepatitis C compensation payments are excluded. This follows on a similar increase of 7 per cent in 1998 over 1997.</P>
    <P>When considered in the context of overall Government spending policy, these significant increases represent a major statement of priority on our part. In working with health boards and hospitals to maximise the impact of this investment on the health and social status of the population, it is my intention to continue to develop services and to seek improvements wherever possible in the delivery of care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that he is a member of a Government which undertook in its programme for Government to tackle the waiting lists? Given that commitment, he cannot stand over a situation where waiting lists are escalating while the forthcoming year will see the closure of beds purely for budgetary reasons. This is, essentially, what the Minister has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that, allowing for the fact that there will inevit<Col N="30" /> ably be bed closures for refurbishment and so forth, he is now saying that bed closures will be used as a financial mechanism to be turned on and off, particularly where budgets are already under what is required? Tallaght Hospital is one such example. Does he not accept that where the budget for this year is £4 million below what is required, there will be bed closures? The public simply cannot believe that a Government can stand over the loss of beds when people are sick and dying for want of an operation.</P>
      <P>The Minister's general attitude is unacceptable in terms of looking at previous Governments and what was done in the past. I wish to cite the example&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider an example, which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will appreciate in his professional capacity. At a time when beds were being closed, a patient with pancreatic cancer &ndash; one of three such patients &ndash; was obliged to wait three months for an operation. That would not have happened 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look again at his policy of refusing to provide beds at 100 per cent capacity when people need them, purely because of financial and accountancy problems which he does not appear to be able to solve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On her first day as her party's spokesperson on health the Deputy asks me not to compare the performance of this Government with that of previous Governments. While it might make the Opposition uncomfortable, I intend to continue to do so, simply to put the scale of the problem in context. It will also allow people to decide about who is making the resources available to deal with these problems. I will continue that practice regardless of how uncomfortable it makes people feel. I am sure we could have a good debate about it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the widescale closure of hospital beds. There is never a widespread hospital bed closure programme during the course of a year. The number of bed days lost is a small percentage, in management terms, of the overall capacity of our hospital system. It is 3 per cent or 4 per cent at the maximum over the course of a year from 1 January to 31 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked why there should be bed closures given the existence of waiting lists. The Deputy has the report on the waiting list initiative and knows when the under funding started. She will also be aware that the rate of increase is slowing down to the extent that we now have a strategy to deal with it, which did not exist previously. I will take my hat off in some respects to some Deputies opposite from smaller parties in Governments who could make their presence felt. It is amazing that the funding for the only public patient initiative was reduced when Democratic <Col N="31" /> Left and Labour were in Government. It is amazing that people in that Government who claim to have greater care for public patients over private patients would allow real cuts in the waiting list initiative allocation during the period 1995-7. That would jolt the ordinary man in the street and it may be one of the reasons that party is on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office we have provided a 50 per cent increase in the first year. I intend to spend £20 million on the waiting list initiative, specifically in relation to surgical procedures, apart from the extra £9 million for services for the elderly this year, as part of our comprehensive approach to dealing with the issue of getting more public patients dealt with. That is the reality. Some two and a half times more money will be spent under this Fianna Fáil led Government than was the case under the waiting list initiative in 1995-7 when Democratic Left and Labour were in Government. At that time a Labour Minister for Finance oversaw three budgets with a total public expenditure programme of £40 billion.</P>
    <P>I will continue to make those political points because they are valid and objective facts and allow the people to understand exactly who is putting in the commitment and who is matching resources with rhetoric. I will not be pigeon-holed or stereotyped by political opposition at any time. I will let the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>On the question raised by Deputy McManus, we still have a persistent, if understandable, suggestion from the Opposition, for rhetorical reasons or for political reasons, that there are cutbacks in the health service. It is becoming tiresome when members of the media are not prepared to ask them where is the cutback in the health system that is providing for a greater level of activity, as statistics show. The number of procedures carried out and the number of patients dealt with in our hospital system was greater in 1998 than at any period in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>A phenomenon every Minister for Health has to face in every democracy I am aware of where there is an advanced health care system is that the level of demand continues to increase. In the case of infinite expectation and finite resources which the Labour Party and Democratic Left found was as much a political reality in Government as in Opposition, there is only a certain amount of money to go around. That has been an increasing cake under this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government at the unprecedentedly high level of £3.4 million this year. An objective argument could be made at any time for increased resources for the health sector. This Government has provided a 10 per cent increase this year and a 7 per cent increase last year at a time when overall public expenditure policy is 4 per cent per annum. That shows that we are putting more money into the health services and that it is an absolute priority. That is not to say there are not problems or that there will not continue <Col N="32" /> to be problems. We are putting more money into the health services and we will continue to do so in both current and capital services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a 3 per cent increase in procedures on average in our acute hospitals does not reflect the need for the total number of increased procedures, in the context of the increase in the population and the longevity of the aged? Is he aware of a widespread and developing view that he is not competent to manage the health services? Is he not aware that the more he shouts and bulls in this House, the less convincing he becomes in persuading people he is on top of the job he has been appointed to undertake? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the sensitivities of the Deputy opposite are upset because I am prepared to state my case candidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Talk about people and patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent people the same as Deputy Shatter. The Deputy has lowered the level of his argument to the tone of my voice. I do not shout but I will make my point as persuasively as I can. I am not shouting, snarling or barking but speaking. I do not refer to any of his physical attributes in that respect. The Deputy may not like my accent but it is the one I inherited and I am proud of it.</P>
      <P>The number of day cases has quadrupled since 1996. There are 250,000 people undergoing a procedure. Formerly they would have had to stay in hospital overnight or for a number of days but they can now be treated on a day case basis. In 1990 there were 125,000 such people, there are now 250,000.</P>
      <P>The simple reply to the question put down by Deputy McManus is that the role of our acute hospital sector is changing. The type of service provided in 1998 is not the same as that provided in 1988 or previously. The reasons are the impact of technology, a greater number of procedures, a greater ability to recover because of the type of procedures being used and the level of care and professionalism provided in our health services. This is much to the credit of those who work in the health service.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is asking why X number of beds this year and X number of beds last year should mean different levels of activity or that we are not committed to the health service, she is not taking into account the changing nature and role of the acute hospital sector in the development of the health service generally. On the question of why public patients are on the waiting list, one of the reasons, as outlined by the people I asked to investigate the matter, is that there are inappropriate placements in the acute hospital sector, which constitute 4 per cent or 150,000 bed days per year and which, if available, would help get more procedures through the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> Despite what the Deputy has been trying to say to the public for the past two weeks, there is a strategy. I am making allocations, not on the basis of anecdotal evidence as was the case with my predecessor, but on the basis of a comprehensive overview, the first which took place in relation to that initiative since 1993. Increased resources are being provided.</P>
    <P>In 1999, some £25 million in additional money was provided for services for the elderly. In 1997, the rainbow coalition provided an extra £3 million for services for the elderly, none of which was for new developments but rather to cover the extra cost of existing developments. I will not take lectures from the Deputy about concern for the elderly, based on that response. I am prepared to defend my position and the position of this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask a question. There is increased productivity. Will the Minister tell the <Col N="34" /> House who is benefiting most, the public patient or the private patient? Is he aware that we are now in a totally new scenario in which public patients, for the first time in my recollection, are being prevented from putting their names down on a waiting list to see a consultant? That is no one's fault but the Minister's. He cannot blame the past. This has not happened before. Consultants are actually closing the books on public patients who want to see them and those patients do not know how long they will have to wait, whether it will be months or years. They are not even given the chance to know that much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the question. First, there is no evidence in the Department to support that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not know the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Second, the medical card holding population represents 32.5 per cent of the population and as a result of our improvements in the eligibility limits for those over 70 that will rise, again a welcome initiative by this Administration.</P>
      <P>Over 40 per cent of in-patient procedures, over 41 per cent of the total procedures, involve public patients. As a result of my negotiation of the consultant contracts, there are far more specific obligations on consultants to ensure that the 11 sessions for which they are contracted for public patients are abided by, and hospital management are to ensure that is done. The evidence suggests that there are many who exceed that base requirement. There are others of whom the same could not be said but I do not accept the point that in some way public patients will not get a better deal under this Administration.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the only public patient initiative which exists to ensure that public patients get more resources is the waiting list initiative, which we have increased by 250 per cent over that available under the previous Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that since he took up office, waiting lists have escalated with the announcement of every set of quarterly figures? Will he also acknowledge that waiting lists continued to spiral from September 1998 to 31 December 1998? Is the Minister in a position to tell the House the total number of people on the in-patient hospital waiting lists as of 31 December 1998? If the Minister does not have that information as we come to the end of January, why does he not have it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I do not have that information is that the agencies are given at least six weeks in which to bring forward that information and then it has to be compiled. The same <Col N="35" /> situation existed in my predecessor's time. If the Deputy reads the report on the waiting list initiative, he will know that the cause for the spiralling of waiting lists from 1995 to 1997 by 33.3 per cent was precisely that&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of <Col N="36" /> which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Owen &ndash; the failure to provide moneys to enterprise boards for the year 1999 due to a misinterpretation by the Department of section 10 of the Industrial Development Act, 1995, which has meant that the budget is fully spent; (2) Deputy Flanagan &ndash; the significant drop in the number of new jobs created by the Industrial Development Authority in the midlands in 1998; (3) Deputy Gerard Reynolds &ndash; the need to provide the necessary capital funding for the building of two extra classrooms at Ransboro national school, County Sligo; (4) Deputy Rabbitte &ndash; the circular issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to chief executives of county enterprise boards stating that no further payments would be made to boards until the enactment of the Finance Act, 1999, which is likely to be in April; if the circular has been withdrawn and if not the implications for the boards and the projects they are supporting of the freezing of such funding; (5) Deputy Farrelly &ndash; the need for the Minister for Education and Science to immediately appoint an ex-quota remedial teacher to St. Oliver's post-primary school, Oldcastle, County Meath, taking into consideration the details which he has received from the school over the past two years; (6) Deputy Gormley &ndash; the need for a remedial teacher at St. Brigid's school, Haddington Road, Dublin 4; (7) Deputy O'Sullivan &ndash; the urgent need to provide funding to ease the crisis in our criminal justice system as a result of the underfunding of State solicitors; (8) Deputy Shortall &ndash; the urgent need to grant generous tax designation to Ballymun in order to ensure its future economic viability; (9) Deputy Allen &ndash; the situation whereby gardaí have been ordered to stop vetting applicants for jobs in schools as well as youth and sporting organisations which removes one of the important safeguards that protects young people from potential abusers and which erodes dramatically the effectiveness of the codes of practice for young people in sport.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach allowing me to be the first to pay tribute to the memory of a former Fine Gael TD, Jim Hession, who died on 12 January.</P>
      <P>Jim Hession was a solicitor in practice for more than 63 years. He only retired from practice on 31 December, shortly before his death. He was widely regarded as one of the great characters of legal practice in the west. The late senior counsel, Pat Lindsey, who was a man of some talent, described Jim Hession as one of the most intelligent people he ever met. Jim Hession enjoyed a very high standing in his profession. He served in this House from 1951 until 1957.  He was effective in his capacity as a Dáil Deputy and was the last Member from Tuam, a matter of regret to the people of the town.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I extend sympathy to his two sons, Barry and Jonathan; his daughter, Carol Gardner; his grandchildren, James, Mandy, Caroline and Robert, and his secretary, Chrissie Costello, who looked after him in his declining years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader of the Opposition in extending sympathy on the death, during the Christmas recess, of James Hession, a former Member. I did not know him but I understand he had a distinguished career as a politician and academic. He was first elected in 1951 and retained his seat in Galway North in the following election. He served his constituents well. When he left the House he concentrated on his legal career and was famous for his wit and banter with his colleagues and presiding judges. He served a total of 63 years as a solicitor. Many of his clients benefited greatly from his advice and expertise. Tuam has lost a great servant. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I offer my deepest condolences to his daughter, Mrs. Carol Gardner, and his sons, Barry and Jonathan. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>I note that the heads of the vocational education (amendment) Bill are being prepared in the Department and its publication is not expected before late 1999.

Does the Taoiseach propose to bring forward that legislation?</P>
      <P>Eighteen months ago the housing Gaeltacht (amendment) Bill was described as a simple administrative measure, but I note it has receded to the position where the heads are being prepared in the Department and its publication is not expected before late 1999. Will the Taoiseach comment on the first Bill which will delay representation of parents and teachers on vocational education committees and on the extraordinary delay in introducing the second Bill, given that it was described as a simple administrative measure required to put decisions taken in the Department on a legal basis?</P>

      <P>The heads of the vocational education (amendment) Bill are being prepared <Col N="43" /> in the Department of Education and Science. The Minister intends to bring the heads of that Bill to Government within the next few weeks with a view to enacting the Bill before the end of this year. The Bill will not be lengthy, it will have probably 15 sections. It will provide a composition of committees having parents and teacher representatives, local authority and community membership. The Bill will not be enacted before the new committees are established following the local elections. Therefore, these committees will be continued under existing law. The second Bill will not be ready until late this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The way in which planning decisions are taken in a manner that may affect many people's lives is a matter of legitimate public concern. The people are entitled to the assurance that the public interest is paramount at all times and that such decisions are taken on legitimate grounds, having regard to employment, effects on the environment and other relevant considerations.</P>
      <P>The Flood tribunal was established by the Dáil at the initiative of the Government and with the co-operation of all parties to investigate persistent and disturbing allegations of corruption in the planning process. Such allegations, if not addressed, gradually undermine trust in the impartiality of public administration and have a corrupting effect on the business climate and the way in which people view how they are governed. Competitiveness studies show that public integrity and honest administration favours business development, while, conversely, corruption tends to discourage it, so we have every interest, both moral and material, in the integrity of our public institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that we in this House, whether in the pursuit of immediate political advantage or otherwise, do not undermine the integrity of the work of the tribunal, especially given the challenges and obstacles which it has already had to overcome to make progress on the task which we have assigned it. It <Col N="46" /> will have to go over, in a more systematic and balanced way, all that we are discussing today and much else besides, with all, not just a few of the relevant people.</P>
    <P>Government members from every party have always been willing to discuss projects that have significant job potential with their promoters. Ten years ago, when unemployment ran to 18 per cent or more of the population and stood between 250,000 and 300,000, employment creation was the top national priority. I, as Minister for Labour, was a member of an employment task force and our job was to find, bring forward and encourage projects that would create sustainable employment. I, like other Ministers of all parties, would have held many meetings to discuss such projects.</P>
    <P>While one always tries to be positive and encouraging, not all such projects on further examination prove to be viable. Some of them would not have been consistent with plans for the area or with public policy in relation, for example, to the size of shopping developments. In other cases, the conditions and incentives which developers might seek might not be feasible. In short, all construction projects have to satisfy certain planning and other criteria, if they are to get clearance to proceed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it seems it is as easy to develop conspiracy theories, usually ill-founded, about why some projects fail to get the go-ahead as it is about why in other cases they succeed. There should never be a basis for the belief that the outcome of a planning application for a project, large or small, depends in any way on the giving or, for that matter, the withholding of a financial contribution to an individual politician or a political party. The purpose of the tribunal is to establish whether there was ever any basis for such a belief and, if that should prove to be the case, to ensure it will never happen again in the future. Anyone in politics who demands or accepts bribes should not be in politics. The work of the tribunals will continue to have my full support and co-operation and that of the Government. I believe and act on the principle that any tribunal of inquiry should be entitled to have all relevant information, documentation and co-operation from me.</P>
    <P>The position is that while Mr. Gilmartin, a property developer originally from Ireland but based in Britain, has, I understand, made a submission to the tribunal, he has continued to make allegations outside of it, with some references to me. Mr. Gilmartin made no financial contributions to me and I had no reason to believe last year that I had any relevant information concerning a meeting with him that would be of significance to the Flood tribunal. However, when a matter like this is suddenly given added political significance and acquires an unexpected prominence, I have always been frank, forthright and co-operative about it.</P>
    <P>It is not always a simple task to check matters that may or may not have happened many years <Col N="47" /> ago. No one's memory is total or perfect, and it would be impossible without huge resources to keep records of every meeting or encounter in a busy political life. Nonetheless, even where there are gaps in memory, all of us will have a moral certainty about things that in particular situations we would or would not have done. I repeat that I am certain I did not ask Mr. Gilmartin in September 1989 or at any other time to make a financial contribution to Fianna Fáil or to me. It is not my way of doing business. I am not even clear from all the various statements attributed to him that that is what he is consistently alleging.</P>
    <P>When this matter first appeared in print, there was no reference to me, nor, to date, has any allegation from Mr. Gilmartin been referred to me for comment by the tribunal. The <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week contained two claims: first, that I raised the question of him making a financial contribution to Fianna Fáil; then, either along with that or perhaps alternatively &ndash; it is not clear &ndash; after difficulties arose and Mr. Gilmartin had rung me about them, a city councillor, who subsequently arrived to meet him at my request, is alleged to have asked him if he had made a contribution to Fianna Fáil. Former Councillor Joe Burke has confirmed to me that he did meet Mr. Gilmartin but is quite adamant that he did not ask him for or about a contribution to Fianna Fáil, at my behest or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, on lunchtime radio, Mr. Charlie Bird claimed, after talking to Mr. Gilmartin, that Mr. Gilmartin rang me in September 1989 because some difficulty had cropped up, and, to use his words, I had asked him about a contribution of £50,000. That could not have happened unless he had brought it up in the first place as I would have had no knowledge otherwise about such a sum being given. If he had mentioned giving money, even quite a large sum of money, during the general election to the then party treasurer, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, I would have had no reason to doubt Mr. Flynn.</P>
    <P>One thing I am adamant about is that I would not have asked Mr. Gilmartin for a contribution for Fianna Fáil, either directly or indirectly, as twice alleged in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. The veracity of his various accounts and the statements attributed to him can only be assessed by the tribunal and not by this House. Anyone he makes reference to is entitled to give their side of history and also to question his accuser rigorously. It is not good enough for Members of this House to make heavily loaded political charges that rely mainly on hearsay and unsubstantiated allegations in the media which may have no basis in established fact.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gilmartin will need to come and provide direct testimony to the tribunal, on which he can then be cross-examined by or on behalf of those he implicates. That is what he should do, in fairness to the tribunal and to those against whom he makes allegations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> While the media plays a key role in bringing to light matters of concern that would otherwise not come under proper public scrutiny, leaks to the media are not adequate as a vehicle to prove the veracity of statements and allegations. Mr. Gilmartin's assertions are a case in point. They have not been adequately challenged or tested for substance or motive, and the media have even, I understand, been forced to ignore some of his statements and explanations because outside of the legal protection offered by the tribunal they might constitute a libel, if published.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to some hostile political statements attributed to Mr. Gilmartin regarding the future of the Government and of individual members. On FM 104 yesterday at 4 p.m., Mr. Gilmartin was quoted as saying: &ldquo;Even if Bertie Ahern survives this week, he won't survive what I have coming down the line for him&rdquo;. I leave it for this House to decide whether this sort of threatening language against a democratically elected Taoiseach is something it would wish to condone or support. All Members of this House, any one of whom could be subject to unproven and damaging allegations made with a view to bringing about some ulterior political outcome, should be wary of coming to premature judgments on the credence or otherwise to be given them, in particular when an impartial tribunal has already been set up by the Oireachtas to establish the truth. This House today should not try to supplant the tribunal or try to pre-empt its hearings or its conclusions, however impatient Opposition parties may be to short-circuit the process. A rush to judgment outside the established framework of the tribunals would be wrong for many reasons.</P>
    <P>The first Tribunals of Inquiry Act, 1921, was enacted to provide a mechanism whereby investigations of a political nature could be carried out by an independent tribunal far removed from Parliament, where the atmosphere of political charge and counter charge makes it very difficult to properly investigate and clarify the truth or otherwise of allegations.</P>
    <P>The issues I am being asked to deal with today fall directly within the terms of reference of the planning tribunal. Without doubt, that is the appropriate forum to investigate all these matters, and I expect the tribunal is already investigating them. I understand, from public statements made by him, that Mr. Gilmartin has already made a statement to the planning tribunal. If the allegations so recently made by him regarding our contacts over ten years ago have been included in his statement, I repeat that I have not so far been contacted by the tribunal about them. I will, of course, be sending a copy of this statement and the transcript of other remarks I have made in the past few days to the tribunal. I believe it is quite wrong that, during the currency of a tribunal of inquiry, attacks of this nature are made against me and other <Col N="49" /> Members of this House. The proper conduct of public policy and a sense of fair play demand a calm and balanced treatment of all these issues, and that is best done in the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the question of my meetings with Mr. Gilmartin. When the story appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, I could only recollect one meeting with him, in my constituency office. My statement issued on Sunday afternoon, in response to media queries, was based quite explicitly on what I could remember. On Monday morning, I made it clear in an interview broadcast at lunch time &ndash; but recorded early in the morning &ndash; that I had initiated a search of departmental records to try to clarify the position with regard to the number of meetings. I consider that I acted speedily and conscientiously in this regard, and put all the facts that I had on the table as soon as I possibly could. I frankly regard it as ridiculous to claim that putting further information into the public arena reflects on my credibility. It is the action of any honest person to take the earliest opportunity to correct any mistakes or original impressions that prove to be incomplete. There was no calculation whatsoever, simply straightforward behaviour, in making available additional information that came to hand. If somebody brought to my attention today hard evidence of another meeting that took place, I would, without hesitation, put it before the House and not expect that to be made into some kind of hanging offence, particularly when the precise number of meetings may not be particularly relevant.</P>
    <P>I issued a statement yesterday, setting out the factual position. I will now put that statement on the record of the House:</P>
    <P>Having exhaustively checked my office diaries, as promised, with the help of the Office of the Minister for Labour Affairs, the Department of Finance and my own records, I have been able to establish that the meeting which I clearly recollected holding with Mr. Tom Gilmartin took place in my then constituency office over Fagan's pub on Monday, 10 October 1988. I was accompanied by a local person at that meeting. Arlington, which is the name of one of Mr. Gilmartin's companies, is the name recorded in the diary.</P>
    <P>I have also established with the help of my former staff in the Department of Labour that there is a record of another meeting in Mespil Road with Mr. Gilmartin at 10.45 a.m. on Thursday, 13 October 1988. According to the records, I also had a meeting a year later with him on Tuesday, 28 September 1989 at 3 p.m. I still have no specific memory of these meetings.</P>
    <P>During my time as Minister, I often had more than 20 meetings in a single day in the Department. I have been reminded by the Office of the Minister for Labour Affairs (formerly the Department of Labour) that at that time I was a member of the Ministerial Task Force on Employment, and therefore I held numerous meetings with groups and companies in an effort to encourage and stimulate employment creation. It is most likely that it <Col N="50" /> was in this context that I met with Mr. Gilmartin.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out before, I am quite certain that I would not have solicited a donation for Fianna Fáil from Mr. Gilmartin, and I have no recollection of any reference made by him to an alleged £50,000 given to the party treasurer, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, in June 1989.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, lunchtime, Mr. Charlie Bird reported a further meeting that is alleged to have taken place in Leinster House involving the then Taoiseach Mr. Haughey, the Minister for the Environment, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, myself and others on 10 March 1989. The then Taoiseach's diary contains no record of such a meeting, nor is it recalled by any official likely to have been in a position to know, nor has any record of it, if one existed, so far been found. This does not, of course, absolutely conclusively prove that no meeting took place, but we have no corroboration of it. I would also point out that, post 1987, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, would not have held meetings involving several people on official business in Leinster House. He would have held them in his own office in Government Buildings. It is highly improbable that the Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, would have been present at a meeting on 10 March 1989, as he then had responsibility for industry and commerce matters as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, and no responsibility for transport. He had a lot of other engagements in his diary that day and there is no mention of him attending any such meeting. Meetings involving several Ministers and a business delegation would have been extremely rare. I have no record in my diary of any meeting in 1987, which means it is unlikely I would have attended one if, in fact, it took place.</P>
    <P>The diary of the then Minister, Mr. Flynn, shows that he had a meeting with Mr. Gilmartin on 10 May 1989, which was two months later. On 27 July 1989 he wrote a letter to the then Minister of State, Deputy Seamus Brennan, stating his understanding that the bus depot element of the Arlington development at Bachelors Walk would not proceed, and that it would not be included in the national plan or transport operational programme, because the proposal was not sufficiently definite.</P>
    <P>Attached to the letter is a note by a civil servant, Mr. Farrelly, stating:</P>
    <P>Minister showed me confidential papers had from M/T &amp; T [the Minister for Tourism and Transport]. Project not included in plan sent to Brussels. Vibes negative for short to medium-term.</P>
    <P>The operative part of the letter states:</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we may be involved in a circular argument here, and I think that we should take steps to resolve it. It is now more than 1 1/2 years since Arlington pledged them<Col N="51" /> selves to a comprehensive redevelopment of the Bachelors Walk/North Lotts area and since the Minister for Finance and myself made statutory orders extending urban renewal designation and tax reliefs to facilitate this. The deadline for completing eligible urban renewal works was fixed under these statutory instruments at 31 May 1991. [The Minister for Finance at that time was Mr. MacSharry].</P>
    <P>CIE began negotiations with Arlington about a year ago for the inclusion of a central bus station in the development. It is now common ground that this proposal can run only with Structural Funds assistance; conversely, Arlington would be able to proceed more quickly with a less ambitious, but still very substantial, development if it were clear that the bus station proposal was not a runner.</P>
    <P>There is clearly an urgent need to clarify the status of the bus station proposal <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Structural Funds. If you judge it a priority for EC assistance, it would be well for this to be conveyed to CIE and Arlington and for the project to be advanced as energetically as possible with the Commission. If you consider that the proposal should not have this priority, then this should be made clear as soon as possible so that uncertainty will not further delay the re-development of an area targeted for early urban renewal by the Government.</P>
    <P>It was further established this morning that there is also in the Department of the Environment and Local Government a record and a report of a meeting that took place on 28 September 1989 between the then Deputy Pádraig Flynn, Minister for the Environment, Deputy Seamus Brennan, the then Minister for Tourism and Transport, Messrs. Dadley, Mould and Boland of Arlington and Mr. T. Gilmartin, who was also on the Arlington team, in the conference room in Leinster House. I wish to read into the record of the House the report of this meeting, taken by a civil servant, Mr. Jimmy Farrelly, the now Secretary-General of the Department.</P>
    <P>The meeting took place during the week ended the 29th of September and was also attended by Messrs. T. O'Brien and Doyle of the Department of Tourism and Transport and J. Farrelly of the Department of the Environment. [That meeting actually took place on 28 September].</P>
    <P>The meeting took place against the background of three options as put forward by Arlington. The first involved the total development of the overall site, costed at some £250 million. In order to secure this, some £54 million would be required from the EEC, CIE, the Department of Transport or whomsoever. On the basis of discussions which the Minister for the Environment had before meeting with the Minister for Tourism and Transport, this option was clearly not a possibility and the Minister for Tourism and Transport indicated <Col N="52" /> that there was no real possibility of capital funding from CIE, the EEC or his Department on the level required. The second option was for a more limited facility which would provide some 75 per cent of the total overall requirements of CIE. It would need State, EEC or CIE funding to the extent of some £30 million. In the same way this development was not on for the reasons that £30 million of State funding was not available. The third option was clearly indicated as non-viable by Arlington. It involved the development of this site as far as the Halfpenny Bridge for a limited commercial development with no CIE involvement.</P>
    <P>Arlington's preferred options would be of course No. 1, but they also regard option 2 quite speculatively, as being one which could be proceeded with, but did of course require some element of State funding for the provision of bus station facilities. Following some considerable discussions, it was accepted that the only realistic prospect of advancing this proposal was to consider the possibility of Arlington providing and financing the bus station on a lease-back arrangement. It was agreed that Arlington have discussion with CIE on this basis and the Minister for Tourism and Transport agreed to seriously consider any proposal put forward along these lines. He recognised, of course, that this also required an element of funding from the State since any such outgoings by CIE would have implications as to the level of CIE subsidy.</P>
    <P>These are all from the minutes of the various meetings taken by attending officials.</P>
    <P>There is also a manuscript, which states:</P>
    <P>Copy of Maps. Showing Arlington site ownership attached &ndash; as supplied at meeting. Option 2 is attractive from the planning viewpoint so that it keeps a number of existing buildings on quays and Abbey Street.</P>
    <P>That would have been the same day, after Mr. Gilmartin met me on 28 September 1989. There is a parallel note of the meeting made in what was then the Department of Tourism and Transport which made it clear that the two Ministers had a meeting with their officials beforehand. All these document are being given to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I have been asked who instigated the meetings with me. I assume the meeting of 10 October 1988 in my constituency was sought by Mr. Gilmartin. In view of time pressures and constraints, doubtless including other people waiting to see me, I would have suggested he see me in the Department on 13 October. He claims he had some members of his team with him at the latter meeting. Mr. Gilmartin suggests that he initiated the meeting and/or telephone call in September 1989. My general practice when I was informed or briefed about something outside my Department remit, would have been to refer the person to someone more closely involved, other Ministers, perhaps, councillors or officials. I do not have any records of the meetings but neither I nor my <Col N="53" /> party have been in the habit of systematically destroying records.</P>
    <P>Something more general should be said about the two projects in which Arlington securities had an interest. The Bachelors Walk project, which involved difficult planning issues, such as the incorporation of a central bus station, the free traffic flows around the area and the need for a new bridge across the River Liffey, fell through for a number of reasons. First, there were delays in acquiring the site. Then British Aerospace acquired Arlington Securities and with a substantial under-utilised landbank of its own throughout the UK decided not to proceed with the project. However, the cause of the project falling was a decision made in London and not in Dublin. Second, the degree of financial support required was not available.</P>
    <P>The Quarryvale project included 1.5 million square feet, a vast scheme on the lines of the Newcastle Metro Centre. It was, in its original form, contrary to the County Dublin development plans and Government policies expressed by ministerial directive. The original scheme was replaced by a more modest proposal put forward by O'Callaghan Properties. In neither instance did the schemes proposed ever become the subject of a planning application lodged before the planning authorities, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with my knowledge of the allegations relating to the EU Commissioner, Mr. Flynn. Some months ago, allegations appeared in the media suggesting that Mr. Tom Gilmartin, an Irish property developer based in Britain, had given a £50,000 contribution in June 1989 to the then Minister for the Environment, Mr. Pádraig Flynn. Fianna Fáil has not submitted an affidavit to the Flood tribunal concerning the non-receipt of the donation of £50,000 from Mr. Gilmartin. The staff member from Fianna Fáil was interviewed by the tribunal. No affidavit was requested. Accordingly, I could not have failed, as alleged in a newspaper today, to tell the Tánaiste about the affidavit because it does not exist.</P>
    <P>I recall my programme manager informed me at the time that he referred briefly, at a meeting with the Tánaiste's programme manager, to the fact that Seán Sherwin would probably go to the tribunal in connection with articles that had appeared in the press about that time and that the party was trawling through its accounts and records of the period with a view to full co-operation with the tribunal. In a discussion it was agreed that in general terms party donations would be a matter for the respective parties.</P>
    <P>The party's general secretary, Mr. Martin Mackin, at my instigation wrote a letter dated 6 October 1998 marked strictly private and confidential to Ireland's EU Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, which I will read into the record of the House. The letter will refute the idea that the party did not investigate the matter until very recently. The letter states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> Dear Pádraig,</P>
    <P>As you are aware there are media reports that a series of allegations have recently been made by Mr. Tom Gilmartin to the planning inquiry presided over by Mr. Justice Flood. Among the reputed allegations is one concerning a sum of £50,000 allegedly given to you and intended for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The Trustees of the party have various legal and fiduciary duties towards the membership of the party. These duties include an obligation to ascertain whether funds were given to any person with the intention that these funds were to be applied for the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party. In the light of the allegation that moneys were given to you for Fianna Fáil I have been asked by the Trustees to make certain inquires. In the circumstances I would be obliged if you would answer the following questions:</P>
    <P>1. Did you or anyone on your behalf receive £50,000 or any other sum of money from Mr. Tom Gilmartin?</P>
    <P>2. If so, was this money given to you or anyone on your behalf intended for the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>
    <P>3. Was the money passed on to the Fianna Fáil Party?</P>
    <P>4. If so, to whom in Fianna Fáil was the money given and when was it so given?</P>
    <P>5. Was any receipt issued for same by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    <P>I would be obliged if you would give to me any documentation in your possession relating to the said moneys. Furthermore, if you have any further information in your possession relating to the alleged contribution from Tom Gilmartin, I would be grateful to be appraised of same.</P>
    <P>I am posing the above questions to you in a formal manner in order that the Trustees will have discharged their duties to the members of the party. I regret any inconvenience that I may cause to you in dealing with the above queries, but no doubt you will appreciate the legal necessity for this line of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I note that today's <i>Irish Times</i> reports that you will co-operate with the planning tribunal and I wish to express our appreciation to you for such a constructive approach. Such co-operation with the tribunal is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank you in anticipation of a response to this letter.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely</P>
    <P>Martin Mackin, General Secretary.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Flynn's office was telephoned to confirm that the letter had been received and there was also a verbal reminder. However, no reply to the letter has been received. When this matter of the £50,000 payment to Commissioner Flynn arose in the newspapers at the end of September 1998 we made investigations and established that the money had not been paid to the party headquarters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> Neither the Government nor the Fianna Fáil Party have any jurisdiction over the EU Commissioner. While we have expressed the wish that he would clarify the situation as soon as possible he is within his rights to reserve his position until the tribunal, and, undoubtedly, as he has stated, he has important work to do with crucial EU negotiations coming up, which have been a priority in my discussions with him in recent months.</P>
    <P>If I understand them correctly, both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Gilmartin have denied that any political contribution was made for favours. They have further asserted that no such favours were given or received. It leaves unresolved the question of whether the political contribution allegedly made to Mr. Flynn was intended for the national party or for Mr. Flynn's own use. It is an issue that not only Fianna Fáil would wish to see resolved as soon as possible, but, I believe, the whole country. As we have seen with regard to allegations in the European Parliament against other Commissioners, unresolved matters of this kind do no good to the reputation of Europe and, in this instance, the reputation of Ireland in Europe.</P>
    <P>Officeholders in particular, whether at home or abroad, need to be more forthcoming than private citizens because far more hangs on the trust placed on them. I have had to deal, here and elsewhere, somewhat prematurely with matters which are properly the preserve of the tribunal. This is an unsatisfactory and one-sided process. Given that this issue has been widely publicised and commented upon outside the tribunal, it would be much healthier if Commissioner Flynn would likewise clarify his position, where he can easily do so and clear the air, but we have no power to compel him to do that.</P>
    <P>This is an open Administration. We have no desire to hide dark deeds from the past. I wish to see established and maintained public standards of which we can be proud and which correspond with the idealism and integrity that characterised the early Members of Dáil Éireann and our respective political parties. I am especially conscious of the high standards set by the founder of Fianna Fáil. We will strive to live up to those standards of austere integrity and we will not allow anyone to undermine them. I am glad we now have a better system of financing of political parties in place that should not give rise to either abuse or allegations of abuse in the future. That will be healthy for our democracy.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that in this House we are frequently too ready to put the worst possible construction on what our political opponents say and do, often on an inadequate basis. Political opponents in these situations try to construct an edifice that build circumstantial and often essentially irrelevant points of detail into major issues of principal and crises of trust. In these situations we habitually fail to distinguish the wood from the trees. In so far as it is within my power, I am determined not to let conflict over what are <Col N="56" /> essentially details cloud the main issues. I do not claim infallibility, but I work exceptionally hard and try to do my conscientious best to honestly represent all the people.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach read a report in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>of 20 September which broke the story of a £50,000 donation for Fianna Fáil to a former Minister which was not paid over to the party? If he read the report, was he attentive to the fact that in that report it was stated clearly that the party's national organiser, Mr. Seán Sherwin, was made aware by the building contractor of the alleged contribution almost ten years ago? Is the Taoiseach aware that substantially the same statement was repeated in another Sunday newspaper the following Sunday, 27 September? Has the Taoiseach asked Mr. Sherwin, since these allegations appeared, whether this is true, and what is the conclusion of his inquiries?</P>

      <P>I normally read the papers but I am not in a position to say whether I read an individual article. When these articles appeared in the Sunday newspapers in September stating that Commissioner Flynn had received £50,000 either for the party or for himself, Mr. Sherwin came to the general secretary of the party and stated that he had a recollection of these matters. The general secretary contacted me. I immediately stated that anything Mr. Sherwin had to say should not be said to me but to the Fianna Fáil legal team and that everything he had to say should be documented and sent to the tribunal. That was done forthwith.</P>

      <P>Having discovered that there was an allegation that £50,000 of the party's money had been stolen ten years ago and that a party official who is still in the party's employment knew about it at the time, did the Taoiseach not consider that he, as president of Fianna Fáil, might want to do something about it rather than simply leave it to a tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I checked whether we received this money. We did not receive it. Mr. Sherwin had certain detailed comments to make about what Mr. Gilmartin said when he came to the office many years earlier. I did not discuss one iota with Mr. Sherwin. I thought it absolutely proper, as I did in regard to many other issues, that the legal team commissioned by us and working <Col N="57" /> for us should take every statement and deal with every matter precisely. We made the tribunal aware of everything in Mr. Sherwin's statement and the tribunal spent several hours interviewing and questioning Mr. Sherwin in the early days of October. I believe that was the proper action to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that others might say he was hiding behind the tribunal and not taking his responsibilities seriously, and that if he discovered that a former ministerial colleague had diverted party funds to his own personal benefit, which senior party colleague is still representing the country, he had an obligation to inform himself about the matter and to interview Mr. Sherwin about Mr. Sherwin's knowledge of the matter? </P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach's programme manager tell the Tánaiste's programme manager that what Mr. Sherwin was going to talk to the tribunal about was the fact that the Tánaiste's former senior Minister, when she was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, had kept £50,000 which belonged to Fianna Fáil? Did the Taoiseach's programme manager tell the Tánaiste's programme manager of the letter that had been sent to Commissioner Flynn? Subsequently, when no reply was received to that letter, given that the Tánaiste has to deal with the Commissioner on a daily basis in a ministerial capacity on behalf of Ireland and would obviously like to know the sort of person with whom she is dealing, did the Taoiseach's programme manager inform the Tánaiste's programme manager that the Commissioner had not bothered to reply to the letter from his party's general secretary?</P>

That is all my programme manager said to the Tánaiste's programme manager. The matter of whether the £50,000 was given to Commissioner Flynn or to the party was an allegation. What concerned the trustees of the party, which is of no importance to the trustees of another political party, was that these matters should be dealt with by the tribunal.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton might be a better lawyer than our legal team, but the Fianna Fáil legal team, who are eminent legal people in my view, perhaps not in the Deputy's, discussed this matter at several meetings. They believed the proper thing to do was to make these matters <Col N="58" /> known to the tribunal and for the tribunal to interview Mr. Sherwin. That is what happened. The letter of 6 October sought to find out Commissioner Flynn's position on it. We never got a reply to that.</P>

Is the Taoiseach aware that in an interview in today's <i>Sligo Champion</i> Mr. Gilmartin states that those present at the meeting in September 1989 were the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, the then Ministers, Mr. Brian Lenihan and Mr. Pádraig Flynn, Deputy Lawlor and the Taoiseach who was then Minister for Labour? Has he records of visits to Government Buildings or Leinster House, and have they been checked? Have the departmental diaries of the respective Ministers been checked? What was the purpose of the meeting? Has the Taoiseach discussed this meeting with Deputy Lawlor, who is quoted by Mr. Gilmartin as introducing Mr. Gilmartin to Mr. Haughey? Has Deputy Lawlor been able to help in regard to establishing the date and the reasons for the meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lawlor has no recollection of any such meeting that he is meant to have set up. As I stated earlier, I have extensively trawled through the diaries of the former Taoiseach and former Ministers. We found many official minutes of meetings which took place and letters which went between Ministers where civil servants were in attendance and where there were contact meetings, all of which were official and above board, involving former Ministers, Mr. MacSharry, Mr. Wilson, Mr. Séamus Brennan and me. All of this was properly done and properly documented both in the diaries and in the records of the Departments. I have many of those letters.</P>

Does the Taoiseach agree a meeting with a business delegation and a group of Ministers including the Taoiseach, as he stated in his initial statement, is a most rare and unusual kind of gathering yet it is clear from the note which he quoted from the official records that there had been extensive discussions with Arlington on the development of the Bachelors Walk site because of the implications with regards to a new bridge, the traffic flow and the road for CIE?

The Taoiseach stated that he checked the records to which Mr. Bird referred yesterday on the radio and he was correct, it was 10 March 1989, but Mr. Gilmartin is now using the date of September 1989. Is the Taoiseach stating that he has checked the records in respect of a collective ministerial group meeting at which the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, would have been present, for the period of September 1989?</P>

      <P>Is it possible that if this was a political meeting to meet with Mr. Gilmartin in the absence of officials care would have been taken to ensure that there was no record of it or would the Taoiseach's records include party political or political meetings as well as departmental meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why Deputy Quinn is asking the question and, in the light of it, I suppose it is a fair question. We have checked it and I have no reason to believe there was any party political meeting. We have spoken to the private secretaries, the officials and officials who were at these meetings. It is quite clear what the meetings were about. There are ten pages on meetings which took place that day. I will not go through it all. There are reports of the meetings. The subject was the proposed Arlington development at Bachelors Walk. The date was 28 September. Present were the then Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, then Minister for the Environment, Mr. Pádraig Flynn; Mr. Raymond Mould, vice-chairman and chief executive of Arlington, Mr. Ted Dadley, chairman of Arlington, Mr. Tom Gilmartin, Mr. Barry Boland, Mr. E. Molloy, bus and rail division, Mr. R. Doyle, Minister's office, and Mr. J. Farrelly, Department of the Environment. There are all of the notes of these meetings, the letters from previous meetings from the offices and diaries of Mr. Flynn and former Minister Wilson and from my office. I think my meetings were probably the briefest because I did not have much to offer. I am quite satisfied, as satisfied as one can possibly be, that there is no matter here which would suggest that there was a political meeting with these people.</P>
      <P>I am not taking issue with Deputy Quinn, who used the word &ldquo;credibility&rdquo;, but he also used another adjective. That is fair enough. On Sunday evening I had only my constitutency records and my memory. I said that I had one meeting, which I recall. I recall it for this reason: it is not every day that somebody turns up at your Monday morning clinic to say that they are going to spend £500 million on a development in your constituency. I remember it well. Mr. Gilmartin impressed me as a person who might do a few things. As Deputy Quinn will recall, those were times when we needed a few things in the city. I moved the matter on to my Department where officials and others would have been involved and then moved it on to others. Unfortunately, I was not able to be of much help to Mr. Gilmartin.</P>
      <P>When I checked my records &ndash; I thank the people in the Department and the Department of Finance who stayed up half the night checking them for me &ndash; they showed up the dates. I immediately put them in the public domain. I did not try to hide them. It is a little unfair on me that when I correct my recollection of the record quickly I am accused of loss of memory, senility or something else. I am not saying Deputy Quinn said it but others have said it.</P>

Is he satisfied that Deputy Lawlor complied with all his obligations as a member of Dublin County Council as regards the declaration of interest in such matters?

He advised him that 1.5 million square feet was not feasible because it contravened the development plan. As regards any political donations, Deputy Lawlor has already, both through the party and publicly, given details about those.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that he wanted to brief me about undertaking this massive development. I remember him discussing the enormity of it with me. I think from his own statements he is saying he brought some of his advisers &ndash; architects or engineers &ndash; to the following meeting, which was obviously the one a few days later in the Department of Labour, which officials of mine would also have attended. He briefed me and told me about the matter.</P>
      <P>When these matters were first raised in newspapers many months ago, a former councillor in my constituency, Mr. Joe Burke, contacted me to say he recalled me asking him around that time to meet Mr. Gilmartin. He recalled that he met Mr. Gilmartin who asked about this development. Councillor Burke told him it would create grave difficulties for the council because it was in favour of the development of Temple Bar but was not in favour of the new bridge or the bus station on the Bachelors Walk site. That was Mr. Joe Burke's only connection.</P>
      <P>I can only assume that at the second meeting, or maybe the first, Mr. Gilmartin asked me if I could introduce him to someone on the council who could help him. Mr. Joe Burke came forward to say he was the individual who did that, at my request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying his recollection is that Mr. Gilmartin's purpose in coming to him, first on 10 October for a meeting, and subsequently to his Department on 13 October, was that he was looking for an introduction from the Minister for Labour, a member of the Cabinet, to a city councillor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the main reason &ndash; the main reason was that he was briefing a number of Ministers. Somewhere in the course of those meetings, I, trying to be helpful, must have said that he should try to win support for his proposal. Unfortunately he did not get much help from Mr. Joe Burke as he informed Mr. Gilmartin of what he saw as the problem. Mr. Burke cannot recall whether he referred him to an official in the corporation &ndash; he said he may have, but he could not be certain. He had no further contact with Mr. Gilmartin at any time after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recollect who was with him at the meeting on 13 October <Col N="63" /> in the Department? Who was the local person who was with him at the meeting on 10 October in Drumcondra? I know the Taoiseach might not wish to name these people. However, it is probably better that they are named here rather than be subject to rumours circulating about them as unnamed individuals.</P>
      <P>Did Mr. Gilmartin raise with the Taoiseach the possibility that the site he was proposing to develop might be granted tax designation and might therefore be more profitable because it would enjoy certain tax privileges which other sites, with competing enterprises on them did not have? Was tax designation raised with the Taoiseach by Mr. Gilmartin at the meetings in October?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to a letter where, in regard to the redevelopment of Bachelors Walk &ndash; North Lotts area it is stated &ldquo;. the Minister for Finance and myself made statutory orders extending urban renewal designation and tax reliefs to facilitate this&rdquo;. When were the relevant tax designations made and was the Taoiseach asked about them at any of his meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the individual who was with me in the Department of Labour, it would have been my normal practice to have one official with me. Officials have been endeavouring to find a note in this regard in the Department &ndash; the book does not contain a note. I did not recall who was with me in my office. However, one of my local supporters contacted me to say he was there when Mr. Gilmartin came in and when I showed him the plans. The individual concerned is Mr. Timothy Collins, who is a friend of mine.</P>
      <P>In relation to tax designation, as I said:</P>
      <P>It is now more than one and a half years since Arlington pledged themselves to a comprehensive redevelopment of .Bachelors Walk.and since the Minister for Finance and myself made statutory orders extending urban renewal designation and tax reliefs to facilitate this.</P>
      <P>Those reliefs were made a year and a half earlier, long before any meeting I had. I have no recollection of the matter being raised as the site was already designated. As Deputy Bruton may or may not know, the quays area was probably the first sanctioned in Dublin under the 1986 urban renewal legislation.</P>

For example, the £30,000 given by Rennicks to the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, which was apparently known about by Mr. Seán Fleming, Mr. Pat Farrell and Mr. Des Richardson and the £50,000 allegedly given to Commissioner Flynn which was known about by Mr. Seán Sherwin.

      <P>Before replying to Deputy Sargent, I will go back to the last question Deputy Bruton asked me. I have to hand the letter I referred to from that time dated 27 May 1988 and it is to Mr. John Wilson, Minister for Tourism and Transport. It states:</P>
      <P>Dear John,</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to your letter of 12 April in which you enquired if a decision had been made in relation to the inclusion of the entire site which had been earmarked for the Dublin Transportation Centre within the limited extension to the Dublin designated area as announced in the Budget. The Minister for the Environment, in a recent Order dated 9 May, has now provided for the adjustments to the boundaries of the Dublin designated area, giving effect to the Government's decision of 18 December last in the matter. This extension only applies to an area north of the Liffey, and will result in all of the 4.8 or so acres of the site mooted for the Transportation Centre on the north side of the river, coming within the designated area.</P>

If Mr. Gilmartin had said to me &ndash; and this is why I am not arguing with him &ndash; that he gave money to Pádraig Flynn or he gave a donation, that would not have registered with me because I would have considered that was the appropriate thing for him to do. If he was giving a donation, he would have given it to our treasurer or maybe to someone on the finance committee. The Fianna Fáil organisation is run that way. At the end of the 1989 election we ended up in a rather sorry financial state, but that is another day's work.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been drawn to claims made in <i>The Sunday Times</i> by a Fianna Fáil councillor in west Dublin, Councillor Colm McGrath, who is reported to have received substantial financial donations from the developers of the Quarryvale project which was the successor to the original Gilmartin project on the M50, in which Mr. McGrath is quoted as follows:</P>
      <P>I am being set up by Mount Street. There is a much bigger story out there involving some people who are now taking the high moral ground.</P>

The Taoiseach has also told us that Mr. Gilmartin met him on the same day. What was the reason for that? What did he ask about?

At that time I made numerous speeches at numerous functions promoting designated areas and encouraging people to build on these areas.

    <P>Deputy Bruton is correct that a function was held by the party in England. It was a fund raising lunch. I do not have the details with me now but I had the date to hand a few days ago. These dates are in the party's records. The function in London was clearly a fund raising event and a number of Fianna Fáil people were at it. It was not a meeting and I do not know how anybody could have thought these functions were meetings. I do not know if Mr. Gilmartin was at it but if he says he was, I believe him.

What does the Taoiseach think about that?</P>
      <P>If Mr. Seán Sherwin came forward now to say he had a memory of these times and events, why did he not come forward between 1989 and 1998 in respect of these matters?

      <P>I do not know whether these matters jogged Seán Sherwin's mind when he saw them. At least he made a statement. That statement which has been given to the tribunal is there and the tribunal has interviewed him. That is to his credit. He could have perhaps made it before, but he has now given it to the appropriate tribunal.</P>

    <P>In relation to the £500 million project, while I have a good memory on the matter of All-Ireland finals and sport quizzes generally, and have a <Col N="71" /> good recollection normally, I do not remember every single meeting. Incidentally when going back over the diaries, they included people whom I met a number of times but could not recall them. In one such case I checked the reason I met a trade union on so many occasions at a particular time. It was because it was amalgamating. I had met the trade union about ten times in that period and I did not recall it. When one meets a large number of people it is impossible to recall them all.</P>
    <P>I remember the meeting with Mr. Gilmartin, as I said to Deputy Bruton earlier, because it was such a big project in a run-down part of my constituency. The others were follow on meetings. I did not say they did not take place and I am not arguing about that.</P>
    <P>In regard to Question No. 22, I am sure the answer I gave was &ldquo;no information&rdquo;, for the same reason I gave earlier that I would not state something I could not stand over, but I will give details and information to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>Regarding the insinuation that instead of being down in the office discussing European matters I should be chasing Mr. Flynn about what he may have done in 1989, it would be inappropriate to do that. I put the letter and the facts on record. The general secretary on behalf of the trustees wrote concerning the matter, our officials went to the tribunal and gave all the evidence to it and it will be investigated.

      <P>The Taoiseach and Deputy Lawlor have categorically denied one of the allegations made by Mr. Gilmartin in respect of a meeting with himself, Mr. Haughey, Mr. Flynn, the late Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Lawlor. I accept the stated position as of now is that there is a conflict in that the Members of this House who are present now &ndash; the Taoiseach and Deputy Lawlor &ndash; have categorically denied that such a meeting took place and, to whit, the Taoiseach has no record or recollection of such a meeting. I agree that such a meeting with so many Ministers in attendance would have left a record somewhere.</P>
      <P>I have two questions arising from that observation. Will the search for records continue after today, because this matter has come upon all of us quickly? Do I take it that the Tánaiste's qualified support for the Government remains qualified or has there been a change in that? If she had taken the five minutes available to her, she might have been able to speak for herself, unless she wishes to speak now through the Chair. Do I take it that the support remains qualified?</P>

If I come across anything which indicates I have misled this House, I will do what I have continually done: I will publicly inform the House.</P>
      <P>Even though this matter is appropriate for the tribunal, the events of recent days bring it in here. I saw a note today that Mr. Gilmartin made these statements because of remarks which were made on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;. I believe what he has said and I know of no other reasons for these allegations. Mr. Gilmartin, from my memory of him was a respected developer working in some capacity for Ireland and had made a great deal of money in Britain. He is a Sligo person by birth. He was involved in two big projects &ndash; one of which was the Bachelor's Walk project which was not completed because only 60 per cent of the land was acquired before it was taken over by another company which changed its plans and made decisions in Dublin. I do not know all the details of Quarryvale although I have read much about it. That did not work either so I am sure there is a certain level of dissatisfaction that neither of these developments worked.</P>

Given the size of the missing sums, would it not be necessary, as happened recently with the ISPCC, to have the Fraud Squad deal with the matter, or indeed the Revenue Commissioners, given that there are tax implications with such sums?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared, following today's questions, to confront Mr. Flynn to secure a response to the letter which he says has not been responded to and does he agree with the Tánaiste that, in view of what has been revealed, Mr. Flynn's position is now impossible?

Does the Taoiseach accept that in the view of ordinary people, whether it be political leaders dropping in to big businessmen for a genteel cup of tea &ndash; Fine Gael's way of doing it &ndash; or big business people arriving at Fianna Fáil's door with massive contributions, this amounts to political corruption?

        <b>: </b>The cheque did not arrive in Fianna Fáil. Why has the Taoiseach not called in the fraud squad? If Fianna Fáil headquarters was broken into and £500 taken, I presume the Garda Síochána would be called in immediately. Why has it not been called in this case in which it is alleged £50,000 is missing? Does zero tolerance apply only to unfortunate heroin addicts who steal handbags? Does the Taoiseach accept that ordinary people find it extraordinary that he wrote Mr. Flynn a single letter &ndash; an apologetic letter &ndash; asking for an explanation? The Taoiseach admitted that he has seen Mr. Flynn many times since. He should have gone over and looked up at him and said, &ldquo;Padráig did you get 50 big ones from Gilmartin and what did you do with it?&rdquo;  It would only have taken five seconds and he could have had an answer in five seconds. Does the Taoiseach accept that ordinary people are perplexed and <Col N="77" /> enraged at the sight of Commissioner Flynn in his high rise fortress thumbing his nose at the peasants here while they continue to pay for his three homes and three pensions? In view of his contempt, will the Taoiseach activate Article 160 of the EU treaty to initiate disciplinary proceedings against this so-called representative of the country?</P>

      <P>I have said many times that I take a dim view of corruption where large sums of money are given in return for favours from politicians. My position has not and will not change. The tribunal is investigating the circumstances of this case. Through cross-examination and other mechanisms we will find out what happened. The answers will be clear. I have not given consideration to Article 160 and I am unlikely to do so.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach cleverly ducked my question.

      <P>We now know that in a Government in which the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, Deputy Smith and others were members, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, was in receipt of vast sums of private donations from business people. We know that the then Minister for the Environment seems to have kept for himself a very large sum of money from a person with whom he was doing business as a Minister. We know that the Minister for Communications in that Government, subsequently the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the current Government, was also in receipt of huge sums of money diverted to his own personal purposes. We know that the Taoiseach knows all these people very well. We know the Taoiseach and Mr. Pádraig Flynn, in particular, worked very closely to defend Mr. Haughey from losing his job. We know that people were afraid to ask Charles Haughey about his lifestyle or, indeed, to ask him any questions, and many people wondered about that. Why was it, when one saw him every day, that nobody had the courage to ask him where all the money was coming from and why these strange things were happening? </P>
      <P>This debate has given us something of an insight into why that sort of thing would happen as then, and still to a great extent, there is in Fianna Fáil a philosophy that believes if there is an awkward question that should be asked, then for God's sake do not ask it. The less one knows the less trouble one gets into.</P>

      <P>The philosophy is to keep things going nicely, be friendly with people and never ask them hard questions.</P>
      <P>There was a question the Taoiseach should have asked of Commissioner Flynn. The Taoiseach has known since September or October last year that Commissioner Flynn has money that belongs to Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has met Commissioner Flynn many times, but he did not have the habit of asking people straight questions. He met him but did not ask him the question. Interestingly enough, when he was going through this exhaustive inquiry to determine the suitability of then Deputy Raphael Burke to become Minister for Foreign Affairs, he did not send him a letter but sent someone off to make inquiries. He did not ask Mr. Burke the straight question: &ldquo;Did you get money?&rdquo;  He could not ask them. Equally, he did not seem to be of the view that one should tell the Tánaiste anything. Just as, by not asking any questions, one does not get any guilty knowledge, if one has any guilty knowledge one certainly does not share that with one's colleagues. Perhaps it will never come out, and perhaps it is better then not to tell them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an example of the deep seated culture of denial and evasion at the heart of the Government. The approach of the Taoiseach to his responsibilities is one of avoiding the truth and avoiding either asking or being asked the hard questions. His approach is one of gradually changing the story as events force him to make the inquiries he should have made long ago but failed to make in good time.</P>

      <P>Regarding his own meetings with Mr. Gilmartin, when he first knew in September that there was a suggestion Mr. Gilmartin had made a donation that had gone astray I am surprised the Taoiseach did not think it worthwhile to check into it. Why did the Taoiseach have to wait until Monday of this week to inquire into this matter? The reason is quite obvious; it did not appear in the newspapers until Sunday of this week and one does not make any inquiries until forced to do so.</P>

      <P>The reason we are discussing this today is the tension, if not the pressure, which has built up over the weekend between the two coalition parties. The Tánaiste has left the Chamber and has declined to offer any view on behalf of the Progressive Democrats as to the level of satisfaction, trust or otherwise that exists between her party and Fianna Fáil. That is a matter for themselves, but it is a prime reason we have devoted all of today's business, excluding <Col N="80" /> Private Members' Business and Question Time to this topic.</P>

      <P>It is from the perspective of 1999 that the period of politics in the era of 1989 is viewed. It was the era when, before a by-election, trees could appear and be taken away afterwards, and former Deputy Burke could get the kind of money for personal expenses that some people would not earn in two years. The culture undoubtedly existed where Mr. Haughey could live at the level he did, and that culture has been revealed by Mr. Gilmartin's assertion and the clear indication that Fianna Fáil shares belief in the possibility that £50,000 was given to Mr. Flynn. We will hear more of that in due course, and it is now quite obvious that that culture is absolutely repugnant and scandalous in 1999.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Taoiseach had no option but to make time available today to answer the very serious allegations made against him and other members of his party in respect of these meetings with Fianna Fáil Ministers. It is now a matter for the tribunal to establish the facts.</P>

I am also satisfied that I have a commitment from the Taoiseach that the search for records that will give us some information as to the specific nature of those meetings, which is not available to us as we speak, will continue, and, when found, as he indicated, will be sent to the tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number Deputies asked why I checked the records about Mr. Gilmartin's allegations only this week, given they were rumoured before the Flood tribunal. I had no approach whatsoever from the tribunal. I did not know Mr. Gilmartin had implicated me in any way with it. I am sure he is not accusing me of anything from the various things that he has said. What is certain <Col N="82" /> is that I issued instructions to all party members and employees to co-operate fully with the tribunal. The staff of Fianna Fáil headquarters have co-operated fully with it and I ask them to continue to do so. All the records were checked last October and staff who were interviewed gave all the relevant information to the tribunal. With the objective of further assisting the tribunal, I wrote to Commissioner Flynn to elicit further information. Having been accused earlier last year of not giving things to the tribunal, I made sure I did so on this occasion. I was more careful than I would otherwise have been and used legal advice all the way. I made sure I did that and I believe I was correct in doing that.</P>
      <P>Many times over the past few years Deputy Bruton has probably done a good job of trying to impugn me of being guilty by association. I would not do that to him.</P>

I make myself more readily available than most to do that and I will continue to do so with tribunals in any form. When I am guilty, I am guilty. When I can defend myself, I will try to do it. That is the job I have to do.</P>
      <P>I consider everyone in this House to be honest and I do not shine the light of guilt on anybody. Rules are sensible. I do not disagree with Deputies Bruton or Quinn about capping expenditure.

Are we, as a State, self-confident enough to enter such a forum, knowing our values and principles, ready to argue for them and, in so doing, make our distinctive contri<Col N="84" /> bution to the maintenance of peace and security in the world?</P>
      <P>This debate in Dáil Éireann is overdue. Contrary to the spin from Government circles, it was not initiated before Christmas by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, rather it began more than three years ago with the public consultation process on and the publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy by the rainbow Government. It is worthwhile recalling what the White Paper states. It states that the overall objectives of Partnership for Peace are consistent with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security. It also states that the Government had decided to explore further the benefits that Ireland might derive from participation in PfP and to determine the contribution Ireland might make to the partnership.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael followed up initiation of the debate with the publication of the policy document, Ireland and the Partnership for Peace Initiative in January 1998. The then Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Gerry McMahon, in a widely reported speech, argued for Irish membership of PfP in a speech to the policy institute in Trinity College in June 1998. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has discussed the issue on many occasions and it has been the subject of consideration in foreign affairs questions in this House on at least five occasions since the Government took office. In an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>before Christmas, the Minister for Foreign Affairs argued that we should debate joining PfP and, more recently, the Taoiseach echoed those comments at a meeting in UCD.</P>
      <P>We have had a long debate. Even if it is only in recent weeks that the Government seems to have come down in favour of this, the time has come for this House to decide, in principle, that Ireland should join Partnership for Peace.</P>
      <P>Many wild claims have been made about PfP so it is important to set out what it is, what Irish membership would mean and why Ireland should now join without further delay. Partnership for Peace was launched at the NATO summit in January 1994 as a co-operative security initiative designed to intensify political and military co-operation in Europe, promote stability, reduce threats to peace and strengthen relationships by promoting practical co-operation among its participants. Since its launch, PfP has attracted the support of almost all members of the OSCE, including the 16 NATO members, Russia, all but one of the states of the former Soviet Union and traditionally neutral states like Sweden, Finland, Austria and even Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The Austrian Ambassador, in evidence to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 1 July 1998 said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Austria's legal advice came to the conclusion that obligations under Article 103 of the UN Charter were on a higher level than the special obligations of a permanently neutral state. We thought that measures decided by the security <Col N="85" /> council under chapter 7 should be regarded as actions of the UN and not as war in terms of international law. There is a clear distinction between military actions taking place under chapter 7 and international law. A war in terms of international law has not happened over the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>The paper circulated by the Ambassador also contained Austria's position on UN peace keeping and the OSCE. He continued:</P>
    <P>Experience in recent years shows that international crisis management has changed its profile. Among other aspects, demand for peacekeeping forces has changed as may be seen from former UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros Ghali's remarks in 1996 that a mandate for peacekeeping by lightly equipped forces can hardly any longer meet its purpose. In light of this development and in continuation of Austria's traditional commitment to international solidarity, it became imperative for us to achieve and improve inter-operability of Austrian peacekeeping forces with other participants in such missions, mostly from NATO countries.</P>
    <P>In Austria's view, Partnership for Peace must be seen as the most appropriate instrument to achieve this goal. By signing the framework document for participation in PfP in February 1995, Austria stressed its political commitment to work together with other partners towards the scopes of the Partnership for Peace. From an Austrian perspective, these include in particular the maintenance of the capability and readiness to contribute to operations under the authority of the UN and or the responsibility of the OSCE, subject to constitutional considerations. This scope also includes the development of co-operative military relations with NATO for the purpose of joint planning, training and exercises to strengthen the ability of partners to undertake missions in the fields of peacekeeping, search and rescue, humanitarian operations and others as may subsequently be agreed.</P>
    <P>The Swiss Ambassador told the same meeting:</P>
    <P>As the 20th century draws to an end, the threats to most European countries are non-military yet very serious. They do not recognise borders or neutrality and no European country can eliminate them on its own, even by classic military means. The threats I am referring to include: terrorism, civil wars, drugs, mass migrations, environmental disasters and the misuse of means of mass destruction. In our fight against these problems we feel increasingly enmeshed in a continental community of destiny &ndash; not neutral but a party with its own legitimate interests to defend alongside like-minded neighbours.</P>
    <P>As the networks to defend such interests are expanding geographically, they are also becom<Col N="86" /> ing tighter and more interwoven; NATO; Partnership for Peace; the EU and its common foreign and security policy and the Western European Union, an OSCE which specialises in preventative diplomacy and the promotion of democracy; the Council of Europe as a promoter of civil and human rights; and the UN which not only has 10,000 personnel in the OSCE area but also provides legitimacy for coercion measures in the interests of peace and democracy.</P>
    <P>With the exception of Partnership for Peace these security elements are not new. What is new is the increasing convergence in their aims and their pragmatic co-operation. It is no coincidence that the Partnership for Peace framework document, before stating the practical aims of the partnership, reaffirms general principles of democracy and human rights, previously adopted by the UN and the OSCE. The practical aims of Partnership for Peace put the emphasis on transparency and civilian control of armed forces as well as on the use of military forces for purposes which are not so much military or unilateral in the traditional sense, but political and humanitarian, and always on the basis of a large consensus. In our view the wide membership of Partnership for Peace, including all previous Warsaw Pact members &ndash; as well as Russia and Ukraine through special arrangements &ndash; makes it very difficult for anyone to claim that the partnership is incompatible with neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Swedish Ambassador stated:</P>
    <P>The purpose of Partnership for Peace is to increase the participating countries' capability and readiness to take part in international peace support operations, to improve search and rescue operations, to improve the efficiency of civil defence and emergency planning and to strengthen democratic control of armed forces. Sweden participates in PfP on the basis of its policy of military non-alignment and we decide on the level and scope of our involvement. The European Atlantic Partnership Council, or EAPC, formed last year, gives the practical PfP co-operation a political dimension in order to further develop the PfP and consult on a broad agenda from peace support operations to civil emergency matters. In addition, the EAPC will allow the PfP countries a greater say in the peace support operations to which they contribute troops.</P>
    <P>The totality of the changes in NATO, the enhanced PfP, the EAPC and the founding act between NATO and Russia are positive and important steps towards a Euro-Atlantic security order. The experiences in Bosnia-Herzegovina prove NATO and partner countries are able to work together towards European security. Practical co-operation within the PfP framework serves the important objective of avoiding new dividing lines in Europe. If a state wants to share the responsibility for European <Col N="87" /> security, it must prepare itself for these tasks. The enhanced Partnership for Peace programme is an essential tool in this respect...</P>
    <P>Our membership of PfP comes from a strong belief that even if one is not a member of a military alliance one has a responsibility as a European country to contribute to the security of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Finnish Ambassador told the committee:</P>
    <P>I will list some of the benefits accruing from the Partnership for Peace. From a political point of view, participation in the EAPC and the PfP is for Finland a means, first, to promote international security, stability and co-operation; second, to obtain information and ensure our own influence in decisions which concern us and third, to show that Finland does her share when it comes to crisis management in the Euro-Atlantic region.</P>
    <P>In participating in PfP's planning and review process we have been able to develop our inter-operability of forces in crisis management activity, which is essential in participating in a NATO led mission. By sending officers to the partnership staff elements, Finland has an opportunity to participate in joint planning of operations with NATO headquarters and our staff officers will be able to familiarise themselves with NATO planning procedures..</P>
    <P>PfP's value is widely recognised in Finnish society. The policy of non-alignment has actually become more credible thanks to our participation in the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>Professor Patrick Keatinge of Trinity College Dublin said at the same meeting:</P>
    <P>Where co-operative security is concerned, there is precious little to be neutral about. Nothing is achieved by abstention.</P>
    <P>Why is Ireland more neutral than all the other European neutral countries? The answer is that we are not. We find ourselves having a continuous national debate, simply because Fianna Fáil, when in Opposition, presented a policy document which the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party was not given the opportunity to change. This made outrageous claims about Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil 1997 election manifesto opposed Irish participation in &ldquo;NATO led organisations such as the Partnership for Peace&rdquo;. In the Dáil last December the Taoiseach repeated that we would not join Partnership for Peace without a referendum. In May 1996 he told an audience in Oxford that Partnership for Peace would &ldquo;send the wrong signals about our future intentions&rdquo; and continued that any decisions involving closer association with NATO or the Western European Union would represent a substantial change in the State's defence policy and would have longer term implications for our neutrality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern, as he then was, stated &ldquo;Any such proposal must be put to the people in a ref<Col N="88" /> erendum, before any decision is taken&rdquo;. He continued &ldquo;I would like a cast-iron pledge now from the Government [of the day] that it will not make any move without first consulting the people in the interests of openness, transparency and accountability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the foreign policy White Paper presented by the last Government, he told the Dáil that any attempt to join Partnership for Peace without a referendum would be &ldquo;a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic&rdquo;. He was against involvement with Partnership for Peace, saying it involved joint exercises in NATO. He asked &ldquo;Will they take place in Ireland?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Will we have British troops back in the Curragh, the French in Bantry Bay, the Germans off Banna Strand, the Spanish in Kinsale and the Americans in Lough Foyle?&rdquo;. Those quotes speak volumes about the research that went into the opposition to Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>As late as December 1997, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, speaking in the Dáil on Partnership for Peace, said: &ldquo;The PfP is a back door to NATO&rdquo;. He continued &ldquo;The association between the Partnership for Peace and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, is too close for comfort in the context of our military non-alliance and the need to preserve our neutrality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In November 1997, in replies to questions from me, the Minister, Deputy Andrews, stated:</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace does not reflect my views, because I regard it as a door opening process to NATO. Our neutrality is important. An engagement in a peripheral organisation related to a military alliance is not the basis of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Within weeks, the Taoiseach was telling a different story to the Kevin Barry Cumann at UCD and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, was writing in the <i>Irish Times</i> that we should start a debate on the PfP issue. This debate has long since started.</P>
    <P>What Fianna Fáil is looking for is a way out of the trap it has made for itself. Having dug a hole, it continued to dig and now, in the knowledge that its position is untenable, irresponsible and misleading, it is trying to give the impression that it is leading the debate for a considered approach to this issue. The country has been hoist on the petard of Fianna Fáil political game playing, at the expense of the country's reputation internationally, and it is clearly damaging to our case for a seat on the UN Security Council, for which we are currently campaigning.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, like Fine Gael, support Irish membership of Partnership for Peace and took this position in the last general election. Labour's 1997 general election manifesto stated: &ldquo;It could be a legitimate and proper role for Ireland to participate, in due course, in the pan-European structure of the Partnership for Peace&rdquo;, noting that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> This has already been joined by other European neutral states, such as Switzerland, Austria, Finland and Sweden. The Partnership for Peace is not a military alliance. Ireland would be free like all other countries to negotiate its own terms.</P>
    <P>It is clear there is a majority within the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party which, if allowed to speak its mind and given an opportunity to have an input into policy making in this area, would support membership of Partnership for Peace, as does Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and clearly the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Ireland stands outside the PfP, along with the states involved in the Balkan conflict &ndash; Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Yugoslavia &ndash; Cyprus, Tajikistan and the tiny states of Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Malta, Andorra and the Holy See. Why? PfP is an extremely flexible arrangement. It allows each member to choose the areas in which it wishes to co-operate.</P>
    <P>The first step taken by participants in PfP is to subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP. The purposes include the projection and promotion of human rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace, the preservation of democracy, the upholding of international law and the fulfilment of the obligations of the UN Charter and OSCE commitments. The objectives of PfP include the facilitation of transparency in national defence planning budgets; ensuring democratic control of defence forces; maintenance of the capability and readiness to contribute to operations under the authority of the UN or the responsibility of the OSCE; and joint planning, training and exercises to strengthen states' abilities to undertake peace-keeping, search and rescue and humanitarian missions.</P>
    <P>In a subsequent step, participants then present NATO with a document known as the presentation document, which sets out the areas in which the participant state wishes to co-operate through PfP. PfP is a flexible concept, in that each participating state determines the areas of interest and the level and extent of involvement in PfP activities it wants. The range of countries involved illustrates the flexible and inclusive nature of the PfP.</P>
    <P>Certain aspects of the framework document, such as the commitment to transparency in defence budgeting, are aimed at former Warsaw Pact states and are largely irrelevant to Ireland. Other aspects of the PfP, such as consultations on further association with NATO, would not need to apply in our terms of partnership. In effect, PfP presents us with a menu of options from which we can pick and choose. Our presentation document, prepared by Irish Ministers and officials, would set the agenda for the terms of our involvement.</P>
    <P>I have set out at some length what the PfP is and what membership of the PfP involves. I have done this because some of the arguments made against joining are so wild and inaccurate as to almost beggar belief.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> The line most often thrown out is that PfP membership would amount to &ldquo;second-class membership of NATO&rdquo;, a military alliance with mutual defence obligations, and, as such, would mean an end to Irish neutrality. Let us be clear, PfP is not a military alliance. It carries with it no mutual defence obligations, rather it is a co-operative structure in which participants themselves pick the areas in which they wish to co-operate. It is for this reason that ultra neutral Switzerland, which is not even a member of the UN because of the obligations it imposes on a member, is able to join PfP. It is why other traditional neutrals, such as Sweden, Finland and Austria, were willing to join PfP.</P>
    <P>The second argument is that PfP represents a step on the slippery road to full NATO membership. Indeed, it is true that both NATO and some PfP members see the possibility that some PfP members may eventually join NATO, but that would be entirely a question for that state and for the existing NATO members.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, each state determines the parameters of its own partnership agreement and can restrict it to whatever area it wishes. For Ireland, the position on possible NATO membership is clear. In a joint statement prior to the Maastricht referendum in June 1992, the leaders of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour, Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats gave a commitment that there would be no change in Ireland's traditional policy of neutrality without there first being a referendum of the people. This was echoed in section 4.115 of the White Paper on Foreign Policy in 1996 and in party manifestos in 1997. Irish membership of PfP would not affect our neutrality, as PfP involves no mutual defence obligations. Indeed, Irish neutrality will only be ended if the Irish people so decide in a referendum.</P>
    <P>The third spurious argument used against PfP membership is that it involves us in activities with states possessing nuclear weapons. The reality is that Irish peacekeepers have served, and continue to serve, with peacekeepers from France, Britain, the US and Russia, all of whom possess nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>What we never hear from the opponents of Irish membership of PfP are the advantages such membership would bring, especially in the context of the changing security architecture in Europe and the changing manner in which the UN operates. We are rightly proud as a people of our contribution to UN peacekeeping over the years. We have an illustrious reputation, as mentioned recently by the UN Secretary General, having served in 40 missions, contributing 45,000 tours of duty and sadly suffering 75 fatalities.</P>
    <P>Opponents of Irish membership of PfP claim it would damage our peacekeeping reputation and our ability to contribute to future missions. This ignores the reality that, increasingly, UN mandated peacekeeping operations are run by regional organisations, such as the NATO led SFOR in Bosnia, the Russian-led CIS troops in <Col N="91" /> Georgia and Tajikstan and the West African Forces, ECOMOG, in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The number of peacekeeping troops under direct UN command has fallen dramatically from a peak of 80,000 to approximately 14,000 today. The future lies in regional organisations taking the lead and as long as we stay outside we become marginalised and less able to continue our proud peacekeeping tradition in an effective way.</P>
    <P>No less a person than the then Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon made this clear in a speech he made in TCD in June 1998, to which I have referred. He was clear on what our non-involvement in PfP means. He said:</P>
    <P>For the Defence Forces it means we miss the opportunity to see and be involved in current peacekeeping and military training prevailing in neighbouring countries. Our ability to retain a competitive edge in the area of peace support is being eroded.</P>
    <P>Rather than PfP membership weakening our ability to engage in peacekeeping, it would strengthen it and enable it to continue into the future.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy set out some of the other advantages of Irish membership of PfP. First, we would be working with OSCE partners on programmes of practical co-operation designed to reduce tension and promote overall security in Europe. Ireland has consistently called for and encouraged the development of such inclusive co-operative security arrangements. Second, it would enhance the capability of our defence forces to participate in UN or OSCE peacekeeping operations through training and exercises with countries with which we share a peacekeeping tradition and thus help to ensure that Ireland is in a position to continue to make an important contribution in the field of peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>Third, it would enable the Defence Forces to make available to European countries which wish to develop their peacekeeping capacities the benefits and lessons of Ireland's long experience in international peacekeeping operations. Fourth, it would enhance Ireland's capacity to undertake search and rescue operations off our coast and to conduct humanitarian missions in response to national or other disasters. Fifth, it would provide a framework for practical co-operation and planning to deal with threats to the environment and drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>We must also see the debate on Irish membership of PfP in the context of Ireland's role in the EU. Twenty six years of membership of the EU has been good for Ireland, enabling us to develop the vibrant, prosperous State we have today, albeit with serious problems to overcome in certain areas. On the basis of solidarity the rich states in the EU helped Ireland to develop through massive capital transfers.</P>
    <P>The question now is what role does Ireland intend to play in the Europe of the 21st century? <Col N="92" /> Serious unrest in the Balkans has seen tens of thousands killed, injured, raped and ethnically cleansed. The view from the UN is that Europe must take the lead in conflicts on its own continent. What is Ireland's role to be? To demand that somebody somewhere should do something about events, such as the mass murder in Srebrenica as long as they are Dutch, German, American or British? There is nothing moral about standing on the sideline as civilians are butchered.</P>
    <P>Involvement in PfP is not about siding with one side. It is about siding with all other European states in being willing to contribute to maintaining peace on our Continent on our own terms and in our own way. It may mean peacekeeping and perhaps, if Ireland should so decide, peace-enforcing. Peace-enforcing is something we should be willing to consider. Sometimes force is necessary to ensure aid gets through or refugees in safe havens are protected. Never again must the world guarantee to protect and then fail to honour that guarantee, as it did with the unfortunate people of Srebrenica We can only make arrangements such as these with credibility if we too are willing to contribute.</P>
    <P>The time has come for Ireland to join PfP. Due to the nature of the PfP arrangement it will take time to work out the detail of our involvement. We would set this out in the presentation document. However, the first step should be taken now by this House agreeing to Irish membership and the Government subscribing to the framework document.</P>
    <P>We have debated this issue inside and outside this House for over three years, during the public consultations on and since the March 1996 publication of the White Paper on Foreign Policy. The time has come to send a signal to our partners in Europe that we are willing to work together in the PfP. It is also time to send a signal to those countries all over the world whom we are lobbying for support in the elections to the UN Security Council that we are willing to work in the regional structures which are the future of the UN authorised peacekeeping missions. In addition, it is time to send a signal to our demoralised Defence Forces that we continue to see a valuable role for them in the developing security architecture. We must not only be part of the changing security architecture, we must be one of the architects.</P>
    <P>What role do we want for Ireland? What role do we want for Europe? If we wish to influence the future shape of European security architecture and not leave it to others to decide we must join with the other European neutrals in PfP. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion proposed by Deputy Mitchell. He has made the running in pushing the debate on this issue. He launched a detailed policy document more than one year ago. Partnership for peace is an invitation by NATO to individual countries to enter a partnership agreement designed to secure peace and stability in Europe through increased military co-operation. It is, in effect, a series of individual partnerships between NATO and the partner nations rather than one overall partnership or agreement.</P>
      <P>Partnership for Peace was first conceived under the stewardship of Les Aspin, former United States Defence Secretary, in 1993. It was publicly launched on 10 January 1994 at the NATO Summit of the Heads of State in Government. The summit was attempting to address the problems of security and stability in Europe following the ending of the Cold War. There was an eagerness on the part of the former Warsaw Pact countries, fearing Russian instability and possible aggression, to join NATO. At the same time, NATO's member states were concerned that an accelerated enlargement of the alliance would destabilise Russian politics. Thus, Partnership for Peace was a compromise.</P>
      <P>At the outset it received mixed reviews and was greeted with scepticism in several quarters. Some commentators viewed Partnership for Peace as a method to buy time for NATO as that organisation dealt with the enlargement issue. However, within a couple of years this view had given way to an altogether more upbeat evaluation. PfP is now seen as having an intrinsic value in its own right, and it is set to become a permanent fixture in the new European security architecture.</P>
      <P>In the post-Cold War security environment, the nature of peacekeeping is changing. The experience of the UN and UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslavia underlines this. NATO's 60,000 strong IFOR operation in Bosnia has shown how important it may be in the future to have military forces with the means to enforce peace agreements. If this requires a greater military contribution than the UN is capable of delivering, the UN or regional groups such as the OSCE will need to be able to mandate military forces to act on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the process for Ireland to join Partnership for Peace? To join, Ireland must sign the framework document. The level of commitment, speed of implementation and scope of involvement is then decided upon by that country in agreement with NATO. It is important to note that it is an individual agreement between each partner and NATO. Partner nations join for different reasons, and when drafting their unique agreement they select from a menu of offers from NATO. This <i>a la carte</i> approach is what makes Partnership for Peace attractive to so many nations with differing resources. It is what should <Col N="94" /> make the concept of membership agreeable to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The framework document outlines the objectives of PfP which are: to develop co-operative military relations with NATO for the purpose of joint planning, training and exercises; to maintain the capability and readiness to contribute to operations under the authority of the United Nations or OSCE; to develop over the longer term forces better able to operate with those of the alliance; to facilitate transparency in national defence budgets; and to ensure democratic control of forces. On joining, nations agree an individual partnership programme with NATO. The main focus of this is to outline the overall military aims and objectives of the partnership nation, set out the education and training requirements of the partnership nation, and enlist the forces available from the partnership nation to participate in Partnership for Peace operations and training. Today we should be debating our individual partnership programme. Unfortunately, we are not.</P>
    <P>The global has now become the local and, as distinct from the recent past, security problems are today seen as shared problems calling for shared solutions. The bonding of Partnership for Peace has assisted greatly in filling the vacuum following the ending of the Cold War, and it is important to remember that in Europe, in this century alone, some towns have been Russian, Austrian, Soviet, German, Czechoslovak and Polish. In 1938, as Hitler threatened to conquer Czechoslovakia, no European state would intervene at that time in what Neville Chamberlain dismissed as a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing. There is a responsibility to uphold the ideals we believe in and an onus to practise the politics of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is not about compromising our neutrality. It is not an institution and thus membership can be revoked at any stage. Those who seek to create a fudge are at best incorrect. Several neutral countries have joined, among them Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland. The ambassadors of these countries gave a presentation to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in July last year. None of them saw membership of Partnership for Peace as impinging on their neutrality. In outlining the benefits accruing from membership, the Finnish representative stated that the aims of Partnership for Peace were: to promote international security, stability and co-operation; to obtain information and ensure our own influence in decisions which concern us; and to show that Finland does her share when it comes to crisis management in the Euro-Atlantic region. Surely these are ideals with which we would wish to be associated.</P>
    <P>In a recent interview the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces spoke of being out in the cold as a military body in Europe. He said that participation in Partnership for Peace would result in many benefits to our Defence Forces by way of access to training and equipment heretofore unat<Col N="95" /> tainable, participation in joint military exercises and access to valuable educational opportunities.</P>
    <P>This debate, however, is not about giving a badly needed boost to our Defence Forces. It is about our willingness to make a contribution to safeguard the ideals in which we proclaim to believe. It is about strengthening our contribution to European security. It is about questioning our development as a nation and seeking to establish whether we are mature enough to step outside the rhetoric of fudge. The fudging of Partnership for Peace and neutrality took place in the debate on the White Paper on Foreign Policy published by the last Government. Partnership for Peace is not NATO, nor is it a back door to NATO. It has been established in response to the new security landscape of Europe opened up by the end of the Cold War. It offers a selective and flexible means of co-operation on military and peacekeeping matters to those who are anxious to break from the adversarial structures imposed by the confrontation between the two main military blocks surrounding the United States and the former Soviet Union. Prospective NATO members have joined Partnership for Peace, but so have Russia, the Ukraine and Austria, none of whom can be considered prospective NATO members. I am glad to commit this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I glad to have the opportunity to speak in support of this motion. I congratulate Deputy Mitchell on tabling it.</P>
      <P>In this country we seem to be of the view that we can stand on a soap-box moralising to the rest of the world, telling other people what they should do, that they should place the lives of soldiers in their armies at risk to resolve conflicts that we will not contribute to resolving.</P>
      <P>Partnership for Peace provides a unique and important mechanism to contribute to peacekeeping within Europe. The record of the European Union in resolving conflicts in Europe and in co-operating on European security and foreign policy issues has been patchy, to say the least. Partnership for Peace, in the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in an article he wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 28 November, is now generally recognised as having developed into a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN mandated peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs frequently debated the tragedy that was besetting Bosnia and that part of Europe during the course of various massacres that were taking place. We urged intervention. We urged the international community to do something about it. Because of our position, when it came to forces going into Bosnia to try to restore peace and order, to try to protect the lives of people and prevent further massacres, we contributed only to a minimal degree to the force that was put together. We are now looking at further tragedy befalling Albania and seeing a number of slaughters and what could <Col N="96" /> be described as genocide in Kosovo. Intervention is inevitable to prevent Serbia perpetrating further appalling massacres on a larger scale than we saw in places such as Srebrenica.</P>
    <P>Are we in this House going to urge Partnership for Peace as an organisation to intervene and save lives and, having satisfied our moral conscience, stand back and not contribute to that force? It is time we recognised that the world has changed and that the old concept of Irish neutrality is a false international currency. Partnership for Peace has the participation of 17 non-member states of NATO. It has the participation of all other European neutral states excluding Ireland, that is Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews was right in his article in <i>The Irish Times</i> when he said the time had come to move away from polarised views and slogans. The original polarised views and slogans derive from the political games former Deputy Ray Burke, as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, started to play with this issue at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. He made a pretence that joining Partnership for Peace in some way violated Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we all cannot join hands in this House in support of Deputy Mitchell's motion and that the two Government parties and the Labour Party are, yet again, kicking to touch on these issues. Such kicking to touch will undermine the credibility of views expressed by Members of this House in those parties on the horrors being perpetrated in European conflicts when we call for others to intervene and simply stand back and observe the carnage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann reaffirms Ireland's policy of military neutrality and commitment to the peaceful settlement of international disputes and to the international rule of law; renews its pledge that, if at any time in the future the issue of entering a military alliance should arise, which involves a collective or mutual defence obligation, the people will require to be consulted by referendum; and consistent with that, in order to enhance Ireland's capacity to take part in peace-keeping operations in zones of instability in the European region, supports the commitment of the Government to build on Ireland's international vocation in support of peace and security, and favourably to examine further Ireland's participation in the Partnership for Peace, taking into account the ongoing public debate and subject to the approval of the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the permission of the House, I wish to share my time with the Minister Deputy Smith. On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I <Col N="97" /> extend his apologies for not being present this evening. As Members will be aware, he is away on business in Iran. He asked me to convey his apologies.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes this opportunity to debate and hear views on the question of Ireland's possible participation in Partnership for Peace. We regard this debate as a further contribution to the process of increasing awareness about PfP and its implications for Ireland which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been encouraging in recent months, both in this House and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that the Minister's two-fold priority has been, first, to enhance understanding and informed discussion of the realities of PfP and, second, in consequence, to move discussion away from the polarised views and slogans which seemed to characterise a good deal of such discussion as there had been about PfP on either side of the argument.</P>
    <P>I hope the current debate will take account of those objectives. Much useful work was done by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in the course of last year. The committee heard the views of representatives of the four neutral states who are participating in PfP. I refer to Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland. A representative of the NATO secretariat also provided information to the committee, and the committee has heard views both in favour of and opposed to Irish participation in PfP.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs briefed the Government on the issue towards the end of last year, with particular reference to the fact that PfP has developed into a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN-mandated peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management.</P>
    <P>It was, and remains, the intention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to bring the issue to the Dáil for further debate in due course in the light of full consideration of all aspects of this issue. For this reason, we consider Deputy Mitchell's motion premature. As the Taoiseach indicated in his statement at UCD some days ago, should Ireland participate in PfP arrangements with NATO it would be on our own terms, as all the other European neutral states and Russia have done. If the Government decides in favour of Ireland's participation in PfP, such a decision, which would make clear the nature and scope of Irish participation in PfP, would be submitted by the Government to this House for its approval.</P>
    <P>The amended motion underlines the commitment of this Government to Ireland's policy of military neutrality, and recognises the reality that participation in PfP would not be in conflict with our neutrality. The Government amendment also reaffirms the commitment, made at the time of the Amsterdam Treaty referendum, that if, in the future, the issue of a mutual defence commitment by Ireland were to arise, it would be put to the people for their decision in a referendum. The amendment recognises the commitment of the <Col N="98" /> Government to build on Ireland's international vocation in support of peace and security, and the importance of Irish peacekeeping in this regard. It is in this context that the issue of Irish participation in PfP should be examined.</P>
    <P>The origins of PfP lie in the situation in Europe following the end of the Cold War. The divisions of the Cold War have been replaced by a new approach based on co-operative approaches to security. This development reflects principles accepted by all European states, including Ireland. Traditional conceptions of security and defence have given way to general acceptance that peacekeeping and crisis management are key to ensuring stability and security in Europe. This evolution goes in the direction of Ireland's approach which has always emphasised conflict prevention and peacekeeping. A clear example of this new approach to security issues can be seen in the EU's Amsterdam Treaty which has accorded priority to the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks.</P>
    <P>The ending of the Cold War has had many positive effects. The polarisation of Europe into two hostile camps has been replaced by inclusive approaches to co-operation between the states of Europe. The Cold War nightmare of a massive military confrontation on our Continent has effectively disappeared. Many of the institutional developments since the end of the Cold War have put great emphasis on the importance of collective security arrangements which recognise that security transcends the purely military aspects. My party's founder, Éamon de Valera, was a strong advocate of collective security in keeping with the principles of international law.</P>
    <P>New and complex challenges, however, have emerged. I need only mention the conflicts and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia in the first half of this decade, and the tragic and continuing repetition of such events in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>I want to summarise some important factors which should inform this debate. First, for the past 40 years, Ireland has been actively engaged in UN peacekeeping. Peacekeeping is a defining element in Irish foreign policy, and a matter of justified public pride. The tributes paid in recent days to the Irish peacekeeping record by the Secretary General of the UN and the historic visit by the Taoiseach to our peacekeepers in Lebanon are vivid reminders of the importance of the Irish peacekeeping contribution to the UN and of the reality that peacekeeping is an integral element of how we see ourselves in the world.</P>
    <P>Second, a major evolution in UN peacekeeping has been taking place. The UN is increasingly reliant on regional security organisations to support and carry out missions on its behalf, as we have seen in Bosnia and Kosovo where the UN, NATO, OSCE and the European Union co-operate as a matter of routine. Ireland has already moved into the new UN approach to regional peacekeeping through our participation. alongside many other non-NATO states, in the Dayton <Col N="99" /> Stabilisation Force in Bosnia, SFOR, which is mandated by the UN Security Council but is conducted on the UN's behalf by NATO.</P>
    <P>Third, one of the new realities of the post-Cold War age is that no one state or institution can by itself deal with the humanitarian, political and refugee crises and the complex threats to international peace and security that we have seen in recent years. That is a reality acknowledged throughout the international community &ndash; in the UN, the OSCE and the EU. New models of co-operation at regional level have been endorsed by the UN and by the OSCE. PfP should be seen in that perspective.</P>
    <P>Co-operation has rightly replaced outmoded notions of competition between the various security institutions in Europe. Ireland's approach is based firmly on the principle of mutually reinforcing co-operation between security institutions, a principle which has been endorsed by the UN Secretary General and by the OSCE at summit level. Bosnia and Kosovo have clearly demonstrated that co-operation involving the UN, NATO, the EU, and OSCE has become not only necessary but is an everyday element in efforts to prevent conflict and maintain peace in those troubled areas.</P>
    <P>Fourth, there is no doubt that in the Defence Forces, which have done invaluable work in peacekeeping over the years, there is a strong view that participation in PfP is of great importance for Ireland's continuing role in peacekeeping. It is Government policy that Ireland should stay in the mainstream of European peacekeeping. Our Defence Forces must have a full voice in preparations for peacekeeping missions. Understandably, the Government does not want to see Ireland absent when matters in which we have a legitimate interest are being discussed. It believes that this can best be done through participation in PfP.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary General, during his recent visit to Ireland, identified clearly the change in the character of UN peacekeeping which came at the end of the Cold War. He reflected on the importance of the evolution of UN peacekeeping from the traditional kind of patrolling ceasefire lines to the modern, more complex manifestations of the post-Cold War era, and commented on the difficulties involved in this process. He emphasised the importance of effective means to undertake peacekeeping in the post-Cold War era. He also observed that peacekeeping today requires not only rethinking the means but also the method of implementing the mandates set out by the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>While commenting that traditional observer missions may still be enough in certain situations, the UN Secretary General has specifically cited the joint NATO-UN peacekeeping and peace-building mission in Bosnia as a model of credibility and legitimacy in peacekeeping. The importance of regional support for UN peacekeeping and conflict prevention should not be <Col N="100" /> underestimated. There is a developing practice of meetings at UN headquarters in New York, chaired by the Secretary General and involving a range of organisations from different regions such as the EU, NATO, OSCE, Western European Union, the Islamic Conference, the Organisation of African Unity and the Organisation of American States.</P>
    <P>What then does membership of Partnership for Peace involve? PfP is a voluntary, non-binding and co-operative security framework of co-operation between NATO and non-members of NATO. When it was launched in 1994 by President Clinton, it was seen primarily as a means of outreach and reassurance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe. PfP has, however, developed far beyond that aspect and is now a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management. Currently 43 countries are involved in PfP, 27 of whom are non-members of NATO. The participating countries include all of our EU partners, the neutral states, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, and even Russia.</P>
    <P>While PfP involves voluntary co-operation by partner countries with NATO in selected areas, membership of NATO is completely different from involvement in PfP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the outcome of the debate on this issue, I wish to make one point very clear: there is no conflict whatsoever between participation in PfP and our policy of military neutrality. The Government would not have the issue of Irish participation in PfP under active review if there was any doubt in this regard. The procedure for participating is voluntary and straightforward. No treaty is involved. Participation in PfP is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a participating state selects the nature and scope of its participation in PfP. The other neutral states, for example, have focused on practical co-operation for peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants in PfP are expected to subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP. The purposes set out in the framework document include the protection and promotion of human rights, rededication to the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace, the preservation of <Col N="101" /> democracy, the upholding of international law and the fulfilment of the obligations of the UN Charter and OSCE commitments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives of PfP include matters such as democratic control of defence forces, which reflects the initial focus of PfP on the emerging Eastern European States. The objectives also focus on maintaining readiness to contribute to peacekeeping operations mandated by the UN or OSCE and there is a focus on joint planning, training and exercises to strengthen states' abilities to undertake peacekeeping, search and rescue and humanitarian operations.</P>
      <P>A participating state also puts forward its &ldquo;presentation document&rdquo;, which sets out its overall approach to PfP and identifies those areas of PfP in which it is interested. Other neutral states have, for example, made clear that they do not wish to join NATO and have identified peacekeeping co-operation as a priority area. The participating state would then develop in consultation with the NATO secretariat a practical programme of co-operation specifically tailored to the areas of interest to it.</P>
      <P>In May 1997, NATO, in consultation with the states participating in PfP, decided to broaden and develop co-operation within the PfP framework, in view of the growing role and importance of PfP as an element in the European security architecture, and specifically in view of the lessons learned from the efforts of the international community in Bosnia.</P>
      <P>PfP has now been complemented by a political consultation mechanism &ndash; the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council, which came into being in May 1997. This council has been an important forum for discussions on Bosnia, Kosovo and future peacekeeping as well as non-military areas of co-operation such as disaster relief in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Euro Atlantic Partnership Council provides the over-arching framework for political and security-related consultations and for enhanced co-operation under PfP. It maintains the approach whereby partners are able to decide for themselves the level and areas of co-operation with NATO. One of the stated aims of this council is to provide an expanded political dimension for multilateral consultation and co-operation on a wide range of security and defence related issues, for example, regional matters, arms control, civil defence and disaster relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of continuing evolution in the international sphere, the Taoiseach, in his statement at UCD some days ago, spoke of the dangers in opting out of, and standing back from, our traditional vocation of international engagement in co-operative efforts to solve the problems of the international community. As the Taoiseach stated, we have a responsibility as a Government not to inhibit for purely ideological reasons our Defence <Col N="102" /> Forces from playing a full role in peacekeeping under changing conditions. We do not need to join military alliances but we must co-operate with the principal regional organisations involved to maintain peace and security in Europe, in keeping with our peacekeeping contributions.</P>
    <P>A number of questions have frequently troubled people about PfP. One question that arises is whether there is an institutional link between PfP and the European Union. The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; but it is a reality, explained by the Government on a number of occasions in this House, that any large scale Petersberg-type operation, conducted by the Western European Union at the request of the EU, may have to depend on NATO's infrastructural resources since the EU is not, nor is it likely to become, a military organisation. The Western European Union would be largely dependent on NATO for such peacekeeping necessities as airlift, communications and other infrastructural support. PfP is a point of contact with NATO for other neutral EU states, as Austria, Finland and Sweden have demonstrated. Another frequently asked question is whether PfP participation entails acceptance of nuclear deterrents. Again, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are divided opinions on the subject of PfP. Ireland is currently outside PfP and one option is to remain outside. For some in this House the prospect of co-operation with NATO on any matter, however voluntarily, will be unacceptable. The other option is to join PfP on our terms. Whatever the eventual decision, I hope that positions adopted will be based on a sober appreciation of the facts.</P>
    <P>It is not true that participation in PfP would adversely affect Ireland's involvement in UN peacekeeping. It is not an issue of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo;. Partnership for Peace is clearly a significant element in enhancing capacities, training and inter-operability for UN peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>I invite the House to reflect on the words of the Taoiseach in recent days. He rightly recalled Ireland's international vocation and reminded us all that we no longer live in anyone's shadow. He suggested that the Ireland of the new millennium should become more active and involved in the world around us, and shed any remaining isolationist instincts or inhibitions. It is in that context that the debate on this topic should proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak in support of the Government's amendment. I am pleased the opportunity is now presented to debate the issue of Partnership for Peace and to explore the question of a possible future role for the Defence Forces in peacekeeping activities under PfP should it be decided at any future date to participate. I indicated in the House my support for an informed debate on this matter as recently as 9 December last.</P>
      <P>It is important that regardless of whatever decision is ultimately reached regarding Ireland's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> PfP, such a decision is preceded by and progressed through a constructive and informed debate, both inside and outside the House, where the views of all interested parties, whether political parties, individuals or organisations, can be heard.</P>
      <P>An essential element in this process is a clear understanding of what PfP is all about. The statement tonight by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, clearly set out the nature and purpose of PfP and what membership entails. There are many misconceptions regarding PfP and certain of these misconceptions have led to some unfounded concerns.</P>
      <P>Partnership for Peace is one element in the development of new inclusive co-operative security arrangements in Europe. It is a co-operative approach to security with the stated aim of intensifying political and military co-operation in Europe, promoting stability, reducing threats to peace and building strengthened relationships by promoting practical co-operation among its participants. While initially it was felt that PfP appeared to be geared to countries aspiring to eventual membership of NATO, it has since been joined by most OSCE countries, including Russia and the former Soviet Republics, as well as the neutral countries, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Switzerland. Currently 43 states participate in PfP.</P>
      <P>The development of structures such as PfP reflects the need felt by some countries arising from the current transitional nature of European security. The emphasis has now shifted away from territorial defence towards issues of conflict prevention, peacekeeping, crisis management and the security threats imposed by international crime. Similarly, the approach in the Amsterdam Treaty reflects the trend away from territorial defence, with its focus on the Petersberg Tasks of peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Petersberg Tasks were conceived in the context of support for the efforts of the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe which the European Union is now seeking to develop under the Amsterdam Treaty. Much of the planning and preparation for the Petersberg Tasks is now carried out by countries under PfP programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> The new European security architecture is essentially a Continent-wide interweaving in collective security in the new and emerging European relations. Within this architecture PfP is a voluntary, flexible non-binding co-operative security framework between NATO and non-members of NATO. It is the very flexible nature of the arrangement which no doubt has attracted so many countries to participate. In addition, PfP can be said to have built on the United Nations Charter. It is recognised that no one state or institution can by itself deal with the complex and diverse challenges to security of the post Cold War world. The former Yugoslavia is probably the best example of the new approach of mutually reinforcing co-operation between a range of institutions.</P>
    <P>As participation in PfP would not involve membership of NATO, participation on appropriate terms would not affect Ireland's policy of military neutrality. Participation would not bring Ireland into any form of alliance involving mutual defence commitments. Neither would it constitute or imply any undertaking or intention to become a member of NATO in the future. The overall objectives of PfP, to which I will refer, are in accord with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security. PfP simply involves voluntary and non-binding co-operation with NATO.</P>
    <P>As regards a possible role for the Defence Forces in peacekeeping activities under PfP, participants in PfP subscribe to a Framework Document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP. These include, <i>inter alia,</i> the protection and promotion of human rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace, the preservation of democracy, the upholding of international law and the fulfilment of the objectives of the UN Charter and OSCE commitments. In addition, individual states decide on the scope of their participation in PfP activities and in this regard agree an individual partnership programme covering the activities to which they wish to subscribe.</P>
    <P>In Ireland's case, should it be decided at any time in the future to participate in Partnership for Peace, it is envisaged that these activities would include peacekeeping under a UN mandate, humanitarian and rescue works &ndash; all tasks in line with our traditional involvement and experience in those most worthy areas of service to our fellow human beings. Considerable benefits would also accrue to the Defence Forces in terms of the training opportunities and experience that participation in PfP activities would afford them. The areas of peacekeeping, search and rescue, etc. are expanding progressively.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is now seen as a dynamic programme in which the four European neutral countries are actively involved. The contribution which traditional peacekeeping contributing countries such as Sweden, Finland, Austria and Ireland can make to organisations which until the recent past had no peacekeeping expertise or experience is immeasurable, and this is evident <Col N="105" /> in the SFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia. Ireland is playing its part in this troubled region through our contribution of some 50 military personnel, mainly military police, to SFOR.</P>
    <P>It is important that we continue to stay in the mainstream of peacekeeping. Partnership for Peace has developed into a major framework for co-operation, training and preparation for UN mandated peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and crisis management.</P>
    <P>Should this House decide that Ireland would at a future date join PfP this development would facilitate our ability and desire to continue to play an active role in these areas under UN, EU or OSCE auspices in accordance with our strong tradition of military neutrality and commitment to active engagement in international efforts to support peace and security. There is no conflict between participation in PfP and Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Our experience of peacekeeping, probably because of our tradition and the way we do things, has been such that we have been welcomed throughout the world. Regardless of what decisions are taken for the future, we will always ensure that the ability and training of the Defence Forces will facilitate the best efforts Ireland can make to provide services, resources and commitment to places of conflict and trouble. We will not avoid our responsibility.</P>
    <P>Ireland is described as the Celtic tiger. We should not shy from participation to the fullest extent possible in helping to solve problems. We understand famine, struggle and other difficulties. Now that we can afford to do more, we should try to do it.</P>

      <P>Not only should we avoid the use of slogans and rhetoric in this debate, we should also avoid stereotyping each other's position. There has been a degree of that in some of the contributions tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no particular wish for politicians to hold to the same views they held years ago but there is a distinct difference between the motion put down by the Minister for Foreign Affairs tonight and the statement of the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in 1996 with regard to a guarantee of a referendum on joining the Partnership for Peace. I believe there is a constitutional imperative for such a referendum &ndash; that is simply a lay person's interpretation of the Constitution &ndash; because of the nature of Partnership for Peace. It is clearly related to NATO. It was established by NATO and in order to become part of the Partnership for Peace a country must make a deal with the High Command of NATO and sign an agreement of mutual interest, not mutual defence. I believe that would be con<Col N="106" /> trary to the Constitution unless there was a referendum to approve it.</P>
    <P>I might not have an opportunity to move the Labour Party amendment to the motion but I wish to read it into the Official Report. It states:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, conscious of the Irish people's long standing commitment to neutrality and their commitment to peacekeeping under UN mandates:</P>
    <P>&ndash; acknowledges the Irish people's consistent support for full membership of the European Union and the sharing of our sovereignty, which this requires;</P>
    <P>&ndash; welcomes the public debate, currently under way, on Ireland's role in the development of a European Union common foreign and security policy, based on the terms of the Amsterdam Treaty;</P>
    <P>&ndash; endorses Irish participation in the development and implementation of such a common foreign and security policy;</P>
    <P>&ndash; expresses concern at the continued existence of huge arsenals of nuclear weapons and urges continued support for efforts to reduce nuclear stockpiles and the production and sales of armaments;</P>
    <P>therefore regards a decision to join the Partnership for Peace as pre-emptive in advance of a fully informed public debate.</P>
    <P>That is not, as was suggested by a Fine Gael spokesperson, an attempt to push the issue away. It is a recognition that there must be a fully informed debate and not simply a categorisation of those who disagree with Partnership for Peace as isolationist and those who agree with it as humanitarian.</P>
    <P>It has never been my view that Ireland should be isolated from the world. We live in a period of rapid political change. In the past ten years we have seen the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the map of eastern Europe change beyond recognition. New alliances are emerging. The Thatcherite tide that threatened to swamp Europe during the 1980s has been reversed, with 13 of the member states of the European Union now being ruled by left or centre left governments.</P>
    <P>The European Union has developed at a rapid rate, moving closer to political and economic union with the enactment of the Maastricht Treaty, agreement on the Amsterdam Treaty and the coming into effect from 1 January of the single currency. Attitudes are changing, positions are being re-examined and views are evolving. There is now a Green Party Minister for Foreign Affairs in Germany who attends at and participates in meetings of NATO Foreign Ministers.</P>

      <P>That is evidence of change. However, I do not wish to apply simplistic views to this development. The Green Party in Germany is in a coalition government and it obviously has an agreement with its SPD partners on this matter. That is the nature of politics.</P>
      <P>In this rapidly changing world it is not sustainable to repeat a meaningless mantra about the sacredness of Irish neutrality, as if we were still in the midst of the Second World War or still trapped in the dark days of the Cold War. In any event, as papers released this week indicate, our neutrality during the Second World War was not, in fact, as neutral as many people believed. In addition, any objective study of Ireland's role during the Cold War will show that it was a similarly lobsided neutrality. That is not to devalue our record of neutrality or the record of successive Governments in keeping this country out of military alliances.</P>
      <P>Despite our neutrality, Ireland has never been an isolationist country. In the 1930s Ireland was an active member of the League of Nations and it has been a member of the United Nations for 40 years. Ireland served on the Security Council and on one occasion provided the President of the General Assembly. Irish troops have served with distinction in virtually every continent. Irish Foreign Ministers, such as Deputy Spring, served with distinction as President of the European Council of Foreign Ministers and in that role helped to broker solutions to many international disputes.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that we should consider the Fine Gael motion. It is a simplistic motion in that it calls, without qualification or conditions, for the entry of Ireland into the Partnership for Peace. In the context of the Irish people's long standing commitment to neutrality and non-participation in military alliances, any proposal that Ireland should join the Partnership for Peace &ndash; effectively a NATO subgroup &ndash; was always going to be controversial.</P>
      <P>There are different views on the issue in the Labour Party. We are engaged in a serious and wide ranging debate not only on Partnership for Peace but on how peace can be guaranteed in our world. There is a range of views on the proposal within Fianna Fáil and one would not have to dig deeply within Fine Gael to also find divergent views on the subject. Whatever decision is taken on membership of Partnership for Peace &ndash; it is no secret that I believe we should not join and I have a coherent and rational basis for that view &ndash; I am satisfied that any decision at this stage would be pre-emptive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for a full and informed debate on the implications of the security needs of the European Union and it is in that context that the question of whether to join the Partnership for Peace should be addressed. When that debate has run its course, the decision will then be appropriate, and initially at least, for the democratically elected membership of the Oireachtas to take. <Col N="108" /> Ultimately it should be put to the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>This is a political issue and I feel a degree of concern that senior members of the Defence Forces and the representative bodies for the Defence Forces have come dangerously close to straying into the political arena in the comments they made on this matter in recent months. However, I welcome today's statement from PDFORRA, in relation to its submission on the White Paper, that this is a matter for the Government and the Irish people. Everybody should be clear about this.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace and the security needs of the European Union are separate and distinct issues. The Partnership for Peace has nothing to do with the European Union as such. It was an initiative of the United States and is effectively a subgroup of NATO. Partnership for Peace treaties are negotiated directly with NATO High Command. There are many member states in the Partnership for Peace but only 14 are members of the European Union. The Partnership for Peace includes many countries which were formerly members of the Warsaw Pact and a number who were members of no bloc.</P>
    <P>As a firm supporter of deeper European integration I accept this process would lead to a common defence and security architecture for the European Union. As a member state of the European Union where support for each of the developments in the Union has been approved by substantial majorities and successive referenda, we must be willing to play our part in this process.</P>
    <P>The Partnership for Peace is now being described by its promoters as the &ldquo;European Defence System&rdquo; with the insinuation that it is a logical extension of EU integration. This could not be further from the truth. The NATO Partnership for Peace includes many states which, because of their human rights records, are explicitly excluded from joining the European Union &ndash; for instance, Turkey. The Partnership for Peace was designed as a vehicle to allow partial NATO membership to the European states which Russia would not simply tolerate as full members of a hostile military alliance. In addition, NATO Partnership for Peace strategy is designed not to assist the democratic integration of the EU but to pre-empt the emergence of a European security system deriving from the common foreign and security policy of the Union and to integrate Europe, through NATO, rather than through the EU.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be preferable to have a European security structure ultimately subject to the European Union than the domination of European security affairs by the militarist trans-Atlantic alliance that is NATO. The major advantage of such a structure is that it would be ultimately subject to the democratic checks and balances of the member states and the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of other myths about the implications of staying out of Partnership for Peace. Staying out of Partnership for Peace does <Col N="109" /> not in any way hinder Irish participation in peace-keeping or peace enforcement operations throughout the world. Most of the operations in which Irish personnel are involved have been mandated directly by the United Nations. Even where peace-keeping operations have been subcontracted out, as in Bosnia, our Defence Forces are participating with personnel from 39 other participating countries, only 20 of whom are members of NATO or Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the frequently repeated line staying out of Partnership for Peace would not rule out joint exercises between the Irish Defence Forces and those of other countries. These are already taking place and can continue as long as the Government considers them to be appropriate. Ireland already has observer status at the Western European Union, a decision taken by a Fianna Fáil led Government. Going in or staying out of Partnership for Peace would have no impact on this observer status whatsoever. Neither would staying out of Partnership for Peace in any way restrict or inhibit our involvement on the international stage.</P>
    <P>One of the particular concerns I would have about the Partnership for Peace is the emphasis that its sponsor, NATO, places on the possession and potential use of nuclear weapons. Ireland has a long and proud record of opposition to the possession of nuclear weapons. As recently as last June the Government took a very welcome initiative with a number of other countries seeking to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and to limit those already in existence. I said at the time that it was a particularly positive development to see Ireland joining with other countries, both inside and outside the EU, who shared our concern about the continuing threat posed by the existence of these weapons. This initiative showed that, notwithstanding the development of a common foreign policy in the EU, it is still possible for an Irish Government to take initiatives in regard to foreign policy issues at UN level, provided there is a political will to do so.</P>
    <P>The June initiative was particularly welcome as it was directed at existing nuclear weapons as well as those being developed by new countries and while the recent nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan have focused attention on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the biggest threat to global safety by far remains the huge arsenal of nuclear weapons held by the big powers.</P>
    <P>With the Cold War very much in the past the case for disposing of these weapons is more compelling than ever. It was an Irish initiative that was largely responsible for the conclusion of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty almost 40 years ago. That treaty had some success in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons but it has not stopped those countries which are determined to secure these weapons. As we approach the millennium it is now an appropriate time to launch another initiative aimed at freeing the world from the awful threat posed by these weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> These are obviously my views but I believe they are the views of a significant number in the Labour Party and that they reflect the views of significant numbers in other parties in this House. I look forward to a rational and informed debate on the matter in the Labour Party, in the Dáil and in the country generally. A balanced course must be mapped out between those who would rush this country into NATO at the earliest opportunity and those who make outlandish claims that every development in the European Union will lead to NATO troops on the streets of Irish towns and villages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say something about the background to what is a thoughtful position outlined by my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, on behalf of the Labour Party, on this issue. An attempt has been made by all speakers so far to be open in what is a necessary debate. What we are asking is that a decision not be taken in the absence of a debate on teasing out these issues.</P>
      <P>To arrive at a decision on membership of Partnership for Peace now or in the proximate future would require that certain matters be clearly articulated and this has not been done. I have some questions. First what is the relationship between the US-British Alliance and a European foreign policy? What did it tell those of us who are interested in the rule of law, in the primacy of the United Nations mandate, in the ability of people to solve their problems diplomatically through their inter-dependency as opposed to military solutions? My second question relates to the word &ldquo;security&rdquo;. When I began to speak about foreign policy many years ago it was still possible to speak about food security, but &ldquo;security&rdquo; as used in this instance is much different, much narrower and more easily perceived through the spectacles of a military lens.</P>
      <P>That in itself raises further questions. Why rush, without debate, to join &ndash; as Deputy De Rossa has said &ndash;  a Partnership for Peace with its NATO connections giving it uncritical acceptance, ahead of any radical debate on the future role of the United Nations or the relationship between the United Nations agencies and other international agencies? With what moral authority do countries who suggest there is something limiting, backward and narrowing about Ireland's right to ask questions, actually pose such an assertion when they themselves are involved in illicit and illegal arms production, distribution and sales, when no discipline has been accepted between the moral imperatives of a non-military Europe and the economic benefit that can be gained from arms production and sales? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to begin this debate very carefully by looking not so much at the architecture of European security but at the geometry of international relations. Few people want to open the debate on the consequences, for example, of there being a single world power. Neither do they want to look closely and examine the features and character<Col N="111" /> istics of our most recent experience internationally of there being such a single power.</P>
    <P>I raise these questions as openers. What has it done in relation to the balance between the General Assembly and the Security Council in the UN? What has it done to the classical primacy of the Security Council resolution generating a mandate? If the conflict is defined in advance, is the role of the major global player made manifest and then a series of processes and adjustments presented as choices or is one suddenly asked whether one is participating. So suddenly &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; takes an entirely new meaning.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace has to genuinely come out of foreign policy and foreign policy has to start with fundamental principles. For example, is it to be structured on the theory of interests? Does that theory include such economic interests as military production and sales, or does it come from a theory of interdependency? Does the theory of interdependency mean that we should stress diplomacy first? If you began with diplomacy, you might end up with forms of partnership.</P>
    <P>Those of us who raise those questions, which are critical questions, are neither isolationist nor limitingly traditionalist; we are simply asking for a good debate accepting interdependency.</P>

      <P>Adequately resourcing and providing administrative backup and supports for our State solicitors are of vital importance. Not only are immediate financial resources required to avert industrial action by our State solicitors next week, but resources are also required if the public are to retain a level of trust in our criminal justice system. The Minister is presiding over a serious lack of resources in the criminal justice system and there is evidence to suggest that before long cases of a very serious nature, including murder, may be struck out because of the level of pressure under which the State solicitors work.</P>
      <P>Last week such a case, a murder trial, in my own constituency, was almost struck out by the presiding judge because the State solicitor, having had the case adjourned five times, came back to court and said he was unable to prepare a book of evidence because of a lack of resources in his office. This case had come up the previous September. Then the State solicitor indicated the problems he was having and, as reported in the local paper when it came back to court recently, said he had been given to understand that he would be getting extra resources by the end of December 1998. He still had not got them by the time the case came to court this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> The State solicitor was not in a position to produce a book of evidence and the case &ndash; a murder case &ndash; was nearly thrown out of court. It is very frightening that this almost happened and it completely undermines our criminal justice system. Last year in the same court a serious forgery case was thrown out of court because of a lack of resources on the part of the State solicitor and his office.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that this is not unique to Limerick; many other areas face similar problems. This is a scandal which makes a mockery of our so called &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; Minister for Justice. If the Minister does not provide emergency funding for State solicitors across the country, our criminal justice system will face crisis. If immediate action is not taken, more and more cases will fall and the hundreds of hours of hard work put in by the Garda to bring people before the courts will be wasted.</P>
    <P>We in this House have been talking for years about the importance of supporting the gardaí in the work they do, the importance of having enough gardaí to bring criminals to justice and the importance of having enough prison places for those criminals. If the court system is falling down because the State solicitor's offices do not have the resources to push these cases to trial, that cog in the machinery of justice will be a serious flaw in the system. It means that gardaí, witnesses and others will be wasting a great deal of time.</P>
    <P>Some months ago the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, outlined his high level goals for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. These included achieving optimum protection against criminality for all members of society and providing the resources and administrative support necessary for the provision of a quality service by the courts. Given the level of crisis in our legal system, it appears that setting these goals was a PR exercise.</P>
    <P>The reasons stated by the State solicitors for their threat of industrial action lie in the fact that they are underfunded in the areas of staffing, research support and overhead requirements. In the context of the Minister's commitment to provide resources and administrative support to the courts to ensure a quality service, I would like to know why this action is being contemplated and why the promised resources have not been forthcoming so far. The public can have little confidence in a criminal justice system which may, because of under-resourcing, have to strike out murder cases. This is further exacerbated by the fact that there are extensive waiting lists for free legal aid services, a matter I have raised on a number of occasions. I am concerned that many cases will be left on the back burner.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain why the resources so badly needed by State solicitors have not been provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy <Col N="113" /> for raising the matter and allowing me, on behalf of the Minister, to clarify the situation.</P>
      <P>State solicitors are private solicitors appointed on a contract basis following open competition and are free to continue their private work. They are appointed by the Attorney General to handle Government business requiring a solicitor service outside Dublin. Their salaries comprise three elements: personal salary in the range £23,664 to £28,284; staff costs in the range £10,617 to £12,537; and other expenses in the range £7,126 to £8,542.</P>
      <P>Contact and discussion with the State Solicitor's Association about their remuneration has been continuing since late 1997 when the association met the Attorney General. The initial request was for a full review of salary by the Review Group on Higher Remuneration but the fact that this would not take place was accepted by the association. Consequently present discussions relate to the staff costs and other expenses elements of their pay.</P>
      <P>Although a full review of the State solicitors' personal salary was not granted, an interim offer was made in June 1998 and accepted by the association. This offer involved a 6 per cent increase in basic pay, effective from 1 January 1998, in line with the increase to assistant secretaries; an interim increase in the expenses element of the remuneration package involving an increase of £2,000 per year for 22 State solicitors with greater workloads and £500 per year for others &ndash; separate arrangements were made for Cork city &ndash; and a review of the work of State solicitors. In the light of the review of the work, the expenses and staff costs elements of the remuneration package would be further reviewed.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the review group were to review and report on the following aspects of the local State solicitor service &ndash; the actual and comparative workloads of State solicitors and the need for rationalisation of State solicitor areas; the arrangements for meeting the cost of support staff and general expenses and the need for special arrangements for remunerating State solicitors in respect of fisheries cases and for any increase in workloads which have occurred in recent years.</P>
      <P>The review group comprised Mr. Michael Murray, State solicitor for Limerick city, nominated by the association, Mr. Paddy McMahon, retired Assistant Chief State Solicitor and Mr. Brian Lenihan, Principal Officer in the Department of Finance. The review group began work in early September and reported on 30 October 1998. Subsequently the recommendations were considered and clarification sought in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local State solicitors have been pressing for some time for improvements in their remuneration package. A report was prepared by a group involving the Department of Finance, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the State Solicitors' Association on the support staff costs and other expenses elements of the State solicitors' <Col N="114" /> remuneration package and completed on 30 October. Following completion of the report, the State solicitors sought immediate action and the State Solicitors' Association has now decided to withdraw services from 1 February 1999.</P>
    <P>Contact and discussion had been continuing on the staff costs and expenses elements of the remuneration package but, because of the need to study the review group findings and their implications, it has not been possible to make a firm offer to the association. This has now been finalised and a meeting arranged on Thursday of last week between the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the State Solicitors' Association was held this afternoon and an offer was put to the association for its consideration.</P>
    <P>Although this issue has been continuing for some time, there has been constant contact with the State Solicitors' Association. This is evident in the fact that an interim offer was made in June 1998 and accepted by the association some time later.</P>
    <P>As Deputies can see from the details of the offer, the interim solution represented a substantial improvement by adding 6 per cent to basic pay and 25 per cent to the expenses element for many State solicitors. Additional extra funding over and above the foregoing has been applied to both Cork and Limerick where particularly heavy work volumes arose. Some State solicitors have heavy workloads. Equally, there are areas where the volume of Government business is not onerous and the remuneration package may be greater than would be justified in a normal commercial arrangement. I am confident that the present negotiations will provide a solution which provides adequate recompense for those State solicitors who require high levels of support staff and overhead costs and at the same time ensure the taxpayer is not burdened with high costs in areas where workloads are low. I appeal to the State Solicitors' Association to permit the current negotiations to continue without resorting to industrial action which can only exacerbate the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A blunder by the Minister of State and the Department has left county enterprise boards without their full allocation for 1999. There are 35 city and county enterprise boards which were established on an informal basis in October 1993 and on a formal basis under section 10 of the Industrial Development Act, 1995. They get 25 per cent of their funding from the Exchequer and 75 per cent from the European Union under the Local Urban and Rural Development Programme, 1994-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the county enterprise boards were established a fund of £100 million was set aside for their use until the end of the operational programme. They were given a commitment that money would be available to them until the end of 1999. It has now emerged that, as a result of a <Col N="115" /> blunder or, to use the Department's euphemism, a misinterpretation of the legislation, the Department assumed that there would not be retrospection and that the fund would last until late 1999. As a result the full £100 million has been allocated because the fund applied from 1993.</P>
    <P>This blunder will have a devastating effect on county enterprise boards. When one considers their role &ndash; to deal with the promotion of small enterprises with ten employees or fewer at local level &ndash; one can appreciate immediately how promised jobs may not emerge because of the lack of a small grant. Capital grants are available up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of capital or £50,000, whichever is the lesser. An employment grant of up to £5,000 may be provided in respect of each full-time job created in an eligible enterprise. It is also possible to obtain a grant of up to 75 per cent of the cost of preparing a feasibility study. These grants are in jeopardy in 1999.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the Minister of State will have to bring forward amending legislation which will not be ready before 3 April to make more money available but that may be too late for some projects. For example, Fingal County Enterprise Board had plans to take £45,000 preference shares in an innovative information technology business but it will not now be in a position to do so with the result that the company will be left in limbo; it may find its future threatened. The board is £166,000 short for the first quarter.</P>
    <P>Because of the mistake made by the Department I call on the Minister of State to immediately make the same amount of funds available as would have been available if the misinterpretation had not happened. It should be possible to find a mechanism, in liaison with the Department of Finance, whereby the money can be guaranteed for 1999, if necessary through a Supplementary Estimate, so that we do not have to wait for the amending legislation to be enacted. A second choice would be to give county enterprise boards permission to raise bank loans with a commitment that the Department will guarantee them and cover full interest payments on them.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all involved in county enterprise boards. During the period 1994 to 1997 they supported the creation of 11,000 full-time and 2,250 part-time jobs. The approximate cost per job is less than £4,000. This is tremendous value in ensuring family run businesses continue to thrive.</P>
    <P>How did this blunder happen? When did the Department become aware that there was a misinterpretation of the Act and that the money would run out at the beginning of 1999? What actions have been taken to ascertain why the information was not available in time to amend the legislation before the Dáil broke up in December? Has action been taken to identify the responsible section or person and ensure a similar problem will not arise? </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> The Minister of State loses no opportunity to claim full credit for the establishment of county enterprise boards. He must, therefore, take responsibility for this blunder. I hope I will not receive the answer that has been given to county enterprise boards, that is, that legislation will be introduced by April. I want a different answer so that I will be able to tell them they will get their money before April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a slightly different position. The Minister of State cannot allow this to happen. It is preposterous. It is the kind of unpardonable blunder that demonstrates that nobody has their hand on the tiller in the Department. One can understand how the Tánaiste is preoccupied with other matters but who is watching the legislation while the Tánaiste is watching the Taoiseach? </P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy &ndash; Mr. Enterprise Board himself &ndash; claims to be the progenitor of the county enterprise boards. Did he issue the circular to the chief executive officers of the boards or was it issued without his approval?</P>
      <P>There are 35 city and county enterprise boards, many of which have meritorious projects approved and many more in the pipeline. I cannot believe that a circular was issued stating, &ldquo;Happy New Year fellows. By the way, I want to tell you that there is no money in the till; we made a mistake, we misread the Act and the Department of Finance has now informed us what is in it. Do not bother me with telephone calls because nothing can be done without amending legislation which will be enacted in April or May.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am being kind in paraphrasing. The circular states, &ldquo;However, the Department of Finance has informed us that our interpretation of the Act is incorrect, i.e., that the £100 million limit applied retrospectively from 1993&rdquo;.</P>

It would appear from the letter that went to the chief executives wishing them a happy new year and no money that <Col N="117" /> legislation is necessary. If amending legislation was necessary on 20 January, why is it not necessary on 27 January? I hope the Minister of State can tell us tonight that the many projects that are already approved, that are awaiting finance, that are about to be approved and that are creating jobs, will not be stymied because of this blunder in his Department. The way we operate in this democracy is that the Minister takes the responsibility, and I hope the Minister of State does so. I hope he tells us precisely the terms in which he hopes to set this right and when the amending legislation will be before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to record my personal appreciation of the record of job creation by the city and county enterprise boards nationally since I established the first board in the city and county of Galway in October 1992. In the meantime 35 city and county enterprise boards have supported the creation of over 14,000 jobs in the manufacturing, tourism and service sectors.</P>
      <P>The average cost per job is approximately £4,000, thus demonstrating that the Irish people are getting very good value for money. Equally encouraging is the failure rate to date, which has been less than 5 per cent of original start ups.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate this Government's commitment to the continued success of the efforts of the enterprise boards, £22.7 million, including a supplementary provision of £1.6 million, has been provided in Exchequer funds to the boards during 1998. Contrast this with the figure of £9.755 million for 1994, the first full year of activity for the boards, or the original figure of £75,000 for local enterprise boards in 1992. This year the boards will receive an additional £21.8 million which will enable them to meet their administrative expenses and maturing contractual grant and other financial obligations. Thus there is no question of staff layoffs, redundancies or approved projects not proceeding for want of grant assistance.</P>
      <P>Section 10(3) of the Industrial Development Act, 1995 &ndash; Deputies Rabbitte and Owen were members of the Cabinet which cleared it &ndash;  stipulates that the maximum in Exchequer money which I, with the prior consent of the Minister for Finance, may make to the enterprise boards is £100 million. Until very recently the understanding of our Department was that the commencement date for computing the drawdown of money by the boards for the purposes of the £100 million specified in the Act was November 1995, when the Act first came into effect. This was based on the reasonable and long held belief that legislation could not be retrospective. So much for those in charge of legislation at that time.</P>

      <P>Maybe Deputy Owen did not like to consult him, but she over-consulted him in this case. However, advice has been given by the Attorney General's office to the effect that the commencement date in computing the drawdown of Exchequer money for the purposes of this Act is October 1992 and not November 1995. If 1995 rather than 1992 had been the commencement date, the £100 million limit in the Act would not have been reached until next year.</P>
      <P>When the gross expenditure was recently reviewed after the outturn for 1998, departmental records showed that the boards had received in excess of £96 million. This left a balance of £3.5 million for advancement to the boards to meet their administration and other requirements. On this basis £2.8 million was advanced to the boards this month with a reserve of some £0.6 million being retained to meet contingencies and emergencies.</P>
      <P>At all times the Department recognised that the level of money advanced could create temporary cash flow problems for a very small minority of boards &ndash; a maximum of three. In an attempt to find a solution to this short-term problem, the Department, at my request, over recent days undertook a detailed analysis of all money advanced to the enterprise boards since their inception. The undertaking revealed that in 1994 £1.3 million was used from the enterprise board subhead for community enterprise schemes operated by FÁS.</P>

      <P>This is £0.2 million more than they received during the first quarter of 1998. It is intended that the new financial limit of £200 million for the enterprise boards will be given effect by an amendment to be incorporated in the forthcoming Finance Bill, which will be enacted by the end of March next. This amending legislation will enable the enterprise boards to continue in funds to meet both their job creation and enterprise development functions into the year 2000 and beyond.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that the very small minority of boards which could but will not now be affected by short-term cash flow difficulties found it necessary to resort to the media and others in the first instance rather than contacting me first.</P>

He read from the circular he got from the South Dublin Enterprise Board and Deputy Owen faxed the Fingal Enterprise Board <Col N="119" /> letter to the media with her statement of 26 January. She said that she was to raise this matter in the Dáil through parliamentary question and on the Adjournment and that she would be calling on the Minister to bring in an immediate Supplementary Estimate. Deputy Owen has been around a long time. Under the Constitution, no Department can bring in a Supplementary Estimate at any month of the year apart from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

The same board gave Deputy Owen a document which she faxed to the media. I know the person; I know Deputy Owen's contact. Not one of the other 35 boards complained; just one complained. Some people love the media and like to fax papers which might be looking for news. The boards are in good hands and there is plenty of money available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been reported in the media that the gardaí have been told to stop vetting applicants for jobs in schools and youth and sporting organisations as it breaches the spirit of the data protection legislation. It is further reported that the gardaí have received advice from the office of the Data Protection Com<Col N="120" /> missioner that the practice of employers getting information where people apply for jobs, approaches being objectionable in principle; the exception is in health board appointments and appointments in the security area.</P>
      <P>I am concerned for young people involved in youth and sports bodies, who may now be without one of the vital procedures which protect them from potential abusers. The Director of the National Youth Council of Ireland has expressed his serious concern about the latest development, as has the secretariat of secondary schools. The INTO is reported as saying it is disappointed that even this minimum protection has been withdrawn. I cannot understand the reasoning behind the Data Protection Commissioner's statement in his annual report that character references should be sufficient evidence for a potential employer. Having gone through the shock and trauma of the recent episodes in Irish swimming and with the knowledge that the abuse of children here is far more prevalent than we thought, I am concerned the important protection provided by the gardaí is now being removed.</P>
      <P>When I was Minister for Sport I appointed a group chaired by Dr. Breda McLeavy to draft a code of ethics and good practice for children in sport in Ireland. That committee produced a comprehensive and effective report in June 1996 which was widely welcomed and has become the benchmark for similar codes throughout Europe. That code of practice, which was produced after a lengthy and broadly based consultative process, is being seriously undermined by the latest developments.</P>
      <P>Sport and youth activities have a very special place in the lives of Irish people, and this would not be the case were it not for the extraordinary commitment and dedication of so many people, particularly those voluntary workers who have devoted themselves to sport, the community and young people down the years. Children, young people and their families should have every confidence that they will be treated with respect and understanding when they take part in sport and youth activities.</P>
      <P>The code of practice provides administrators, coaches and players with guidelines and standards to be used in dealing with young people in sport; these are as much for the protection of adult volunteers as for the young people. I believe now the parents of young people will have less confidence in the systems that exist to protect them. I ask the Minister to carry out an immediate review of the position in order to strengthen the hands of those who are there to protect the well being of our children. I see nothing wrong with applicants for jobs in these sensitive areas being asked to provide references and any details that are required. The onus should be on them to provide the evidence that they are above board and are bona fide applicants. That would be a way around the difficulty in this area. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned today in my reply to Question No. 814 from Deputy Currie, this is a very complex matter and one which is clearly of considerable importance as it relates to the security and safety of children while, at the same time, bearing on the privacy rights of individuals.</P>
      <P>To set matters in context, I wish to emphasise there has been no change in the arrangements whereby the Garda Síochána carry out clearance checks in respect of full-time prospective employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals. These arrangements are implemented by the Garda Síochána in strict adherence to legal advices received in the matter from the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a large number of other organisations with responsibility for child care who engage staff, ranging from full-time paid staff to voluntary staff, who are not covered by the arrangements I have described. To guard against undesirables participating in such activities and as, I mentioned in reply to Question No. 356 on 30 June 1998, my Department together with the Garda authorities are at an advanced stage of discussion with FÁS, the aim of which is to extend to employees having substantial contact with children in non-residential community employment schemes, the same arrangements as apply to prospective employees in the health care area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, in the absence of any formal procedure, a practice developed whereby employers of prospective employees, not coming under the formal arrangement, requested the Garda &ndash; with the written consent of the employees &ndash; to provide copies of personal data relating to the individuals concerned under section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988. This <Col N="122" /> data would have included any personal data held on the Garda criminal records database.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they were recently advised by the Data Protection Commissioner that section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, does not provide for the disclosure of personal data to third parties, irrespective of whether the individuals in question had consented to allow the Garda to respond to the prospective employer and, on the advice of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Garda authorities have ceased to do so.</P>
    <P>The Data Protection Commissioner has also advised that section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, does not provide for a situation where an employer may request that a prospective employee should make a request under section 4 of the Act and insist on receiving from the individual concerned a copy of material received on foot of such a request. The Data Protection Commissioner's view is that the essence of data protection law is that it enhances privacy by putting the individual in control of his or her information, and that access sought by an individual on foot of a request to that individual from a prospective employer may be regarded as an unanticipated use of what was intended by the Oireachtas to be a key aid for individuals in protecting their privacy.</P>
    <P>The latest contacts between my Department and the Data Protection Commissioner have identified possible ways to resolve this difficulty. Urgent consultations are ongoing between my Department, the Garda authorities and the Data Protection Commissioner with a view to identifying an alternative solution under the legislation. On conclusion of these consultations I will make a further statement on this matter. I hope to do this very soon. I thank Deputy Allen for raising this important matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 January 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 38, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 18 December, following negotiations and consultations involving Assembly parties and, as appropriate, the Irish and British Governments, the First and Deputy First Ministers reported that agreement had been reached on the departmental structures and on North-South Co-operation. The ten new Departments and corresponding ministerial offices which will be responsible for the work of the current six Northern Ireland Departments will be: Agriculture and Rural Development; Environment; Regional Development; Social Development; Education; Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment; <Col N="125" /> Enterprise, Trade and Investment; Culture, Arts and Leisure; Health, Social Services and Public Safety; and Finance and Personnel. In addition, the office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will have an economic policy unit and special responsibility for equality.</P>
    <P>In relation to North-South co-operation, six areas were identified as suitable for the establishment of implementation bodies. These were inland waterways; food safety; trade and business development; special EU programmes; language; and aquaculture and marine matters.</P>
    <P>An additional six areas were identified as suitable for co-operation through existing bodies: health; transport; agriculture; education; environment and tourism. A publicly-owned limited company is to be established in relation to the latter.</P>
    <P>On 18 January, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister submitted their joint report to the Assembly. I look forward to the final report which will be submitted to the Assembly for 15 February and which will facilitate the enactment in the UK, by the target date of 10 March, of the legislation enabling the formal transfer of legislative powers. Our own timetable will proceed broadly in parallel and the objective of both Governments is to have all the Agreement institutions go live shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>I have continued to meet and liaise with the parties and others on Northern Ireland before and after Christmas. Over the past weeks I have met with the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Seamus Mallon; Mr. Sean Neeson, leader of the Alliance Party; and Mr. Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin. I have also been in regular contact with Prime Minister Blair and I will meet First Minister David Trimble at the end of this month. I do not propose to report in detail on each meeting or telephone conversation that I have had. However, I will say that recent discussions have, of course, focused on progressing the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement in all its aspects. The question of further meetings with Prime Minister Blair is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>We all know that difficult issues remain to be dealt with. All of the parties to the talks are aware of their obligations and we expect them all to deliver. We must, all of us, be willing to take those vital steps forward together, in the coming weeks, in order to get over the current impasse. We must ensure that the implementation process is credible, that progress is made and that a political vacuum is not allowed to develop. This process is about bringing an end to a conflict that has dogged this country and its people for too long. It is about delivering good, democratic, accountable governance in Northern Ireland and real practical benefits to the people, North and South, and the sooner we are able to do this, the better.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Government are pressing on with the work of preparing for the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies. Officials from the relevant Government Departments, together with <Col N="126" /> officials from my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs, are engaged in an intensive programme of work with their Northern counterparts to ensure that the North-South institutions will be ready at the same time as the other institutions, as required by the British-Irish Agreement and the appropriate legislation will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General of the Commonwealth paid a courtesty visit to me on 10 December, in Government Buildings, during which we had a friendly exchange on a number of issues.</P>
    <P>I propose to visit Northern Ireland again in early February. I will undertake a number of functions, including attending a reception in Newry, in response to an invitation from Newry and Mourne District Council</P>
    <P>I look forward to visiting the United States for St. Patrick's Day again this year. The programme for this visit is in preparation.</P>
    <P>On the issue of further meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I would make the point that this is not a matter for me, or the Government but for the Chairperson and all the participating parties and would refer the Deputy to my replies to previous questions on 8 December and 6 October.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of according Oireachtas representation to the citizens in the Six Counties, I wrote to the Chairman of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution on 11 April, following the conclusion of the British-Irish Agreement. I suggested that the committee might consider how people living in Northern Ireland might play a more active part in national political life, to the extent that they so desire and in a spirit consistent with the principles underlying the peace settlement.</P>
    <P>I understand that the committee subsequently invited written submissions from the main political parties in Northern Ireland and it received the latest submittion on 7 December. The committee intends to invite interested parties and individuals to make oral submissions in February.</P>
    <P>The committee published a Progress Report on the Presidency last November. It is now examining the provisions in relation to the national Parliament and it will report thereon as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 to 43, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I attach high priority to maintaining close ongoing contact with the social partners, on both a formal and informal basis. My most recent formal engagements took place in the context of the inaugural meetings of NESC and NESF on 4 and 12 November respectively, on which I have already reported to the House. In addition, I chair one of the quarterly Partnership 2000 plenary meetings each year. The most recent was last July's plenary and my next such engagement will probably be in July this year.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's plenary meeting focused principally on the themes of Competitiveness and Agriculture, Forestry and Food (including Rural Exclusion). Also on the agenda were presentations of Budget '99 and the draft report of the Expert Group on Child Care.</P>
      <P>Throughout this year, the focus will be on the twin aims of completing the implementation of Partnership 2000 and paving the way towards a successor agreement. In that latter regard, the NESC has been asked to prepare a new strategy report which would form the basis for a successor, while the NESF has been asked to take on a new role in developing policies and the programmes to tackle long-term unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. It will also have an important contribution to make in evaluating the effectiveness of policies within the context of both the social partnership agreements and the national anti-poverty strategy. Another key priority throughout 1999 will be the promotion of partnership at workplace level. This work will be led by the National Centre for Partnership, in which both IBEC and ICTU are active participants.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The Ministers and Secretaries General Group on EU Policy which I chair meets approximately every four to six weeks. As part of its general supervisory role in relation to EU policy, the group is responsible for co-ordinating the Irish approach to key European issues, including Agenda 2000.</P>
      <P>However, we are in a period of very intense negotiations on the next round of Structural, Cohesion and Agricultural Funds. In recognition of this, the Government has established a Cabinet subcommittee, which I chair, on Agenda 2000 specifically, to co-ordinate the Government position on the main elements of Agenda 2000 negotiations as they develop. This committee is serviced by an expert technical group which I also chair and is comprised of senior officials from my own Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance. This group has met twice already and prepared a number of papers for the Cabinet subcommittee. The smaller more frequent meetings of the subcommittee and of the technical group will allow for much greater engagement by the key Ministers in the detailed strategy of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The German Presidency has underlined its determination to reach agreement on the Agenda 2000 package by end-March. To achieve this aim, it is now almost certain that there will be an informal Heads of State or Government Meeting on 26 February. After this meeting, the Presidency intends to bring all strands of the negotiations together in advance of the special summit meeting in Berlin on 24-25 March.</P>
      <P>In addition to the groups I have mentioned, the Department of the Taoiseach participates in policy formulation and follow-up on key issues arising in the EU Agenda such as Agenda 2000, Structural Funds and Enlargement; EMU; institutional reform; employment; justice, freedom and security; and external relations of EU, CFSP through a variety of interdepartmental groups and fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU policy formulation is the product of liaison between my Department and the other key Departments, notably the Department of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Agriculture and Food, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, <Col N="129" /> Equality and Law Reform. My Department also liaises with the offices of other EU Heads of State or Government, HOSGs, and their embassies in Dublin. Through this network of contacts the Department advises me on the views of our European partners and contribute to the development of EU policies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware from my reply of 16 December progress is being made in implementing a number of the recommendations contained in the SMI Working Group Report on Information Technology through the work of the Interdepartmental Implementation Group on the Information Society.</P>
      <P>The Government recently considered that group's first report, which covers a wide range of issues including measures to improve delivery of public services using information and communication technologies, and on the basis of their report, has adopted an action plan for implementing the information society in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I launched this action plan on Monday, 25 January and I expect that it will result in progress being made on a number of the issues identified in the SMI working group report.</P>
      <P>The SMI working group report contains a number of recommendations on the acquisition and retention of skilled IT staff. In December, 1998 the Department of Finance reached agreement with the unions on a set of once-off exceptional measures to retain skilled IT staff engaged in year 2000 work until that work is completed. This includes scope for reassignment of suitable administrative staff to IT work and, where it is deemed appropriate payment of a loyalty bonus in April 2000 to skilled IT staff. Four IT officers in my Department who are working on the year 2000 issue will qualify for special bonus payments.</P>
      <P>The remaining recommendations of the report including those relating to staffing issues, will shortly be considered by the SMI implementation group, in the context of completing the SMI programme of action on information technology and I expect that a report will be submitted to Government at an early date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to the House on 30 September 1998, a Partnership 2000 Working Group on Basic Income has been set up under the aegis of my Department. The group has commissioned a study which is being carried out in two phases. The overall purpose of the study is to consider and evaluate the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system. Draft reports from the consultants on the first phase of the study, which examines the costs and distribution analysis of a basic income, were received, as expected, at the end of October.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the methodologies involved in costing and analysing the distributional effects of a basic income are both complex and time consuming. The research team comprising the ESRI and Professor Charles Clark of St. John's University, New York, have been engaged in reconciling a number of issues which are fundamental to the conclusions. The Working Group on Basic Income has been providing information and assistance to the consultancy team in recent weeks in addressing costings, taxation and the other issues involved.</P>
      <P>As a result, the first phase is being finalised, incorporating material now available in respect of the 1998 out-turn on relevant variables, and will be presented to a meeting of the working group in February. The second phase of the study, which will consider the dynamic effects of basic income, will then move ahead rapidly.</P>
      <P>Progress on the study was reported to the social partners at their quarterly meeting yesterday.</P>
      <P>The study and the report of the Partnership 2000 working group will enable the Government to examine the matter. It is intended that a Green Paper will be published, as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>The Irish Statute Book, containing Acts of the Oireachtas from 1922 to 1997 in CD-ROM format went on sale on 17 December 1998. One hundred copies were released through the Government Publications Sales Office. The Statute Book was simultaneously made available on the Internet.</P>
      <P>A further 500 copies were produced earlier this month. Of these 100 have been made available to the Courts Service and 340 have gone on sale this week. The Incorporated Law Society has placed a separate order for 2000 CD-ROMs and these will be received next week. The total cost of the contract to make the Statute Book available in electronic form is £825,000.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the next phase of Irish Statutes in CD-ROM format will be available in May. This CD-ROM will include the Acts of the Oireachtas, Statutory Instruments and the Chronological Tables of the Statutes from 1922 to 1998.</P>
      <P>The agreed contract price provides for a further 400 CDs in the second phase of the project. The Office of the Attorney General are currently discussing the cost of obtaining additional CDs. The material will also be available on the Internet.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 93 of 9 December 1997, the contract for the publication of Irish Statutes and Statutory Instruments in CD-ROM format was awarded to Juta &amp; Company Ltd. of Capetown, South Africa. The contact was awarded in accordance with public procurement procedures.</P>
      <P>In February 1997, the Official Journal of the European Union published a contract notice from the Office of the Attorney General inviting tenders to publish Irish Statutes and Statutory Instruments in electronic form.</P>
      <P>Tenders were subsequently  received from nine groups, some of which had the involvement of Irish based companies. The tenders were evaluated in accordance with the award criteria detailed in the request for tender documentation. The evaluation was undertaken by an in-house working group in the Office of the Attorney General with the assistance of Deloitte &amp; Touche.</P>
      <P>In awarding the contract the proposal from Juta &amp; Company Ltd. of Capetown, South Africa, was selected as the most suitable. It was also the lowest-priced qualifying tender.</P>

      <P>Also, the NESC secretariat will continue to work on a study benchmarking Irish progress in the areas covered by the Partnership 2000 agreement both over time and by comparison with other countries. The subject matter includes work on education, taxation and child care. Some of the material in the benchmarking exercise will be drawn upon for the strategic review. It is intended that the results of the research will be published later in 1999.</P>
      <P>A short report on profitability in the Irish economy and associated policy issues is also in preparation. The report is due to be considered by the council in the spring.</P>
      <P>The NESC secretariat is also preparing a study of housing in Ireland. Its objectives are to provide an overview and assessment of the situation in the main housing sectors and to recommend a consistent set of policies designed to address the various problems in housing. The report will be published in 1999.</P>
      <P>Other elements of a work programme may be agreed later by the council subject to the priority task of the strategic review.</P>

      <P>The Government Information Service issued 255 speeches and statements on my behalf in 1998. The number of speeches is indicative of the high number of official engagements which I undertook in the course of this year. All scripts of substance are posted on the Internet. All scripts are copied to the Library in the Houses of the Oireachtas and are available from the Government Information Service. The previous Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, issued approximately 122 speeches from May 1996 to May 1997. There was roughly the same number of speaking notes for that period.</P>

This covers the manager's salary, shift allowances paid to six staff on secondment from Departments and other general administration costs. The salaries of the staff on secondment are paid by their parent Departments and my own Department pays the shift allowance, amounting to one sixth of each officer's salary.

These statistics are a count of divorce applications and divorces granted. They do not provide information on the social aspects of divorce sought by the CSO.

      <P>The provision of funding for drug misuse related services in the Western Health Board area is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance. I am not aware of my Department having received an application for funding from the organisation. The organisation has been in contact with the Western Health Board regarding receiving financial aid. Subsequently the regional drugs training officer of the board has been in contact with members of the organisation with regard to facilitating a local parenting programme for drug prevention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Western Health Board is supportive of the organisation's parent to parent programme it has invited it to enter into a joint venture with the board to provide a drug questions, local answers course. This course is a training programme which is community based for health and education professionals, gardaí, youth workers, parents and others interested in drug related problems and is facilitated by the health boards. It allows participants examine the nature and extent of the drug problem in their local area and suggests ways to tackling these problems. I understand that the board also intends to actively liaise <Col N="139" /> with the organisation in the future with a view to developing a comprehensive response to the drug problem in the area in which it operates.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to complementary and alternative medicine in Ireland, including acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine, is that it is not regulated and at present I have no proposals to regulate it. I am aware of proposals before the European Commission at present to consider carrying out a research study in the area. It is anticipated that any such project will result in registration of some type in the member states.</P>
      <P>With regard to the control of standards and codes of practice in the area, my Department's policy has been to encourage the various branches of alternative-complementary medicine to establish their own regulatory structure and to develop mechanisms to inform the general public about the availability of services from reputable therapists. Practitioners in this area are free to provide services to the public as long as they do not represent themselves as being registered medical practitioners.</P>

    <P>Dr. McCutcheon's contract of employment is with the board of management of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital. I have not had any communication concerning the reasons for Dr. McCutcheon's resignation, other than those set out in the statement issued by the board following <Col N="140" /> his resignation. Dr. McCutcheon's decision to resign was a matter for himself and I respect his decision.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that any further resignations are being considered either as a result of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report or consequential to Dr. McCutcheon's decision.</P>
    <P>The report from Deloitte &amp; Touche provides an agreed basis for addressing the current goverance and management problems at the hospital and I had discussion with representatives of the board of management of the hospital last month about its implementation.</P>
    <P>These discussions resulted in agreement on the way forward. I announced today the establishment of a three person group, with support from management consultants, to assist the hospital in the implementation of the report.</P>

      <P>In an overall context the principal criteria used by my Department in assessing new technology and drugs is based on the assessment of needs and the service plans submitted by health boards and voluntary hospitals to my Department.</P>
      <P>Health technology assessment is a process that goes beyond describing equipment specifications and it requires an assessment of the use of technology including drugs in the context of the processes and medical procedures to be carried out.</P>
      <P>In this regard an <i>ad hoc</i> group was set up by my Department in May 1998 to develop a health technology framework that will provide the basis for better decision making and enable benefits and cost effectiveness to be measured and evaluated in relation to health and social gain and level of service to the patient. It will also assist health service providers in optimising their economic health resources.</P>
      <P>The members of the group are drawn from across the health sector on the basis of their knowledge and expertise in the area of health technology. They are currently focusing on technology that is emerging into practice and the development of protocols and guidelines in this regard. Other interested parties will be identified and consulted as work progresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to medical devices there are two sets of regulations which transposed two EU directives into Irish law. They contain provisions which must be followed before medical devices can be placed on the Irish market. These are: The European Communities (Medical Devices) Regulations, 1994, Statutory Instrument No. 252 of 1994 and the European Communities (Active <Col N="141" /> Implantable Medical Devices) Regulations, 1994, Statutory Instrument No. 253 of 1994.</P>
    <P>The regulations form part of an overall drive to complete the single market in Europe by laying the groundwork for establishing harmonised standards in the manufacturing of medical devices. The regulations have a defined scope and lay down essential requirements for medical devices and the procedures for checking that all products comply with them. Devices meeting these requirements will be entitled to carry the CE marking and be placed on the Community market without further restrictions.</P>
    <P>Before affixing the CE marking to a device, a manufacture must go through one or more conformity assessment procedures to confirm that the design and-or production ensures compliance with the essential requirements of the regulations. The stringency of these procedures depends on which regulations apply and also on the risk classification of the device concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the conducting of clinical trials, the Irish Medicines Board has sole responsibility for ensuring that all clinical trials are carried out in accordance with the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1887 to 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 89 and 614 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has issued comprehensive guidelines to health agencies setting out a recom<Col N="142" /> mended phased approach to achieving year 2000 compliance of systems and equipment. A tabulated list of these agencies will be circulated in the Official Report. In the guidelines it is suggested that the agency, as an early project phase, should compile an inventory of all their systems and equipment which may have implications for the year 2000.</P>
    <P>My Department has also issued recommended deadlines for achieving year 2000 compliance. For information technology systems and non-IT equipment the recommended deadline is 31 August 1999. While for the supply chain, the deadline, which encompasses contingency planning, is 31 July 1999.</P>
    <P>My Department in its role of ensuring year 2000 compliance in the health service has and continues to take action to create awareness, facilitate the co-ordination and sharing of resources and information, providing on the ground assistance to agencies and monitors progress. In the latter area the following measures have been put in place: monthly progress reports to the Department by major agencies as part of the integrated management reporting process; reports every two months from smaller health agencies and health corporate bodies; a number of special interest groups have been established to allow agencies share information and provide feedback. The Department takes an active role in these groups and monitors the attendance of agencies. Groups have been set up as follow IT, medical devices and equipment, estates, laboratories, small agencies and the supply chain, and at present officials of my Department are meeting with individual agencies to review progress and to identify areas where assistance is required.</P>
    <P>In 1998 my Department allocated £5 million specifically for achieving year 2000 compliance of IT systems. In addition, £1 million was allocated as a contribution to agencies to assist with the non-IT costs associated with year 2000 projects.</P>
    <P>In 1999 it is intended that a significant proportion of the health service equipment allocation will be used to ensure year 2000 compliance. Similarly, with the year's capital IT investment programme it is intended that the greater part of the £14 million allocated will be used to achieve compliance.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the possible cost implications of the year 2000 problem, particularly in relation to embedded systems which are common in the health area, the Government in this year's budget have established a contingency fund totalling £40 million. I intend to call upon this fund if it proves that normal allocations do not cover the cost.</P>
    <P>While a considerable amount of work has yet to be done by agencies, our objective is that the safety of clients and staff will be secured and that services will be maintained with minimal disruption.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 618 together.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report on Tallaght Hospital published on 15 December 1998, provides an agreed basis for addressing the current governance and management problems. This report is accepted by the hospital and I had detailed discussions with representatives of the board of management of the hospital last month.</P>
      <P>These discussions resulted in agreement on the way forward. A key element of this agreement with the hospital was agreement in principle on the mechanism to oversee the implementation of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report. I announced today the establishment of a three person group to carry out this function. The membership of the group is as follows: Chairman: Mr. Kevin Bonner, former Secretary-General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Mr. Donal O'Shea, Chief Executive Officer of the North-Eastern Health Board and chairman of the Task Force on the Eastern Regional Health Authority and Professor John Murray, Professor of Business Studies at Trinity College Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> The task of this group will be to ensure that the hospital retains fully the confidence of the public, staff and suppliers; the recommendations of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report are implemented fully as speedily as possible and governance and high level management are secured to a level which will enable the planned phased development of services at the hospital to be resumed. The group will report to the Minister who will keep the president of the hospital advised of his assessment of progress on the achievement of the above objectives.</P>
    <P>The group will be empowered to seek whatever reports and information from the board and management of the hospital as it deems necessary and will have access to all aspects of the hospital's operations and information. Primary responsibility for the implementation of the report and all other matters relating to the governance and management of the hospital remains with the hospital authorities.</P>
    <P>The group will be assisted and supported by Deloitte &amp; Touche Management Consultants.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of this initiative together with the consultants involved is estimated at £150,000 plus VAT.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations, 1998, which I made recently have removed the provision which allowed health boards to assess the capacity of adult sons and/or daughters over 21 year of age to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent. The change is effective from 1 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards have been instructed to review the position of all those in receipt of a reduced rate of subvention by virtue of the capacity of a son and/or daughter to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care. While it may take some little time for all such reviews to be completed, I wish to emphasise that any <Col N="146" /> change in the rate of subvention payable will be back dated to 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>As of 31 October 1998, the number of applicants in receipt of nursing home subventions was 6,583. It is estimated that about 500 applicants are in receipt of a reduced rate of subvention due to the assessment of their sons and/or daughters circumstances.</P>

      <P>The hospital consultants' contract was negotiated in 1997 and introduced with effect from 1 January 1998. It is due to be examined again by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector next year. The provisions of the contract have never been advanced as either contributing to the length of waiting lists or of hindering any initiatives to reduce waiting times. The contract allows hospital managers to monitor the balance between the public and fee-paying elements of a consultant's practice and to take appropriate action if it is not satisfied that the consultant's commitment to public patients is being properly discharged. The contract is explicit in its requirements that a consultant's private practice must not be conducted at the expense of his or her public commitment. Recent guidance issued to health agencies in relation to waiting lists draws the agencies' attention to these provisions and to the need to monitor the mix of public and private patients in public hospitals. Agencies were also requested to ensure that service plans should safeguard equity of access and maintain the agreed proportion of public and private patients treated.</P>

      <P>Data on mortality, including suicide, are routinely published in the annual and quarterly reports on vital statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office. Details of the most recent figures available on the number of suicides for the first two quarters of 1998, on a county basis, will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuing rise in the incidence of suicide is a cause of considerable concern. The report of the National Task Force on Suicide which was <Col N="147" /> published in February 1998 put forward a national suicide prevention/reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the report, I have been in contact with my ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Environment and Local Government, with a view to implementing the task force recommendations in so far as these Departments are concerned. My Department has also contacted all the statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies requesting that the necessary measures are put in place to ensure the implementation of the recommendations which relate to their respective areas.</P>
    <P>A core recommendation of the task force report is the establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards. The group's main responsibilities include the review of ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, the co-ordination of research into suicide and the making of recommendations to the chief executive officers of health boards which, it is hoped, will assist in the reversal of the growing incidence of suicide.</P>
    <P>The group was established last year by the chief executive officers of the health boards and has met on three occasions, most recently on Tuesday, 26 January 1999. Arising from the deliberations of the group so far, it is intended to appoint a full-time researcher/co-ordinator with secretarial facilities. I have provided the necessary funds to the group to allow this important work to proceed.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision of services on the ground are concerned, my Department is involved in a number of areas. The Irish Medicines Board have made recommendations involving certain additional restrictions in the sale of paracetamol, together with additional warnings on the packaging and information leaflets. An extensive consultation process has been conducted in relation to the board's recommendations <Col N="148" /> and the question of introducing regulations to give full statutory effect to the recommendations is under examination. I am glad to report however, that most pharmaceutical companies and pharmacists are giving effect to the board's recommendations on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The majority of health boards have established working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Suicide. The working groups are multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary and engage in the promotion of positive mental health and the de-stigmatisation of suicide, provide information in relation to suicide and para-suicide, liaise with the media and provide training requirements for staff in relation to all aspects of suicide and para-suicide. The process of consultation with statutory and voluntary groups regarding the issue of suicide has also commenced in many health board areas. Resource officers have been or are about to be appointed in the health boards with responsibility for implementing recommendations of the task force.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that groups at risk of suicide, in particular the young and older age sectors of our population, have greater accessibility to relevant health services at times of stress. I am committed to further developing consultant led child and adolescent and old age psychiatry services during 1999 which will assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. A total of £1.378 million has been provided to the health boards this year in respect of continued development of these services.</P>
    <P>An important development in the education sector which will promote self-esteem and self-confidence and enable students to develop personal and social skills is the approval by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, of a social, personal and health education syllabus for primary level and the junior cycle for post-primary level schools. I understand that a subcommittee of the NCCA course committee is meeting to develop an implementation strategy that will be recommended to the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment and the maintenance of waiting lists in the Southern Health Board area are the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board are being developed in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan. The Dental Health Action Plan provides for the development of a consultant-led service by each health board. A consultant led service ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board. I understand that the waiting list for orthodontic treatment is currently 3,220. The Southern Health Board is currently treating patients who were placed on the treatment list at or after September 1996. The waiting period for persons on the treatment waiting list is therefore two years and four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an Orthodontic Review Group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services. The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards <Col N="152" /> over the past few years under the Dental Health Action Plan.</P>
    <P>I understand that this group has recently made its report to the chief executive officers of the health boards and is now under consideration by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 94, 100, 126, 138, 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>The figures requested by the Deputies are set out in the tables which will be circulated to them. They relate to 30 September 1998, the latest period for which information is available, and to 30 September and 30 June 1997.</P>
      <P>I have recently taken a range of significant initiatives to address the issue of waiting lists and waiting times for public in-patients. These include the provision of £20 million for the treatment of patients on waiting lists. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the 1998 figure and is 2.5 times higher than the amount allocated by the previous Government for waiting lists in 1997; the provision of £9 million for services for older people. This will help to free up acute hospital beds, some of which are occupied at present by patients who cannot be accommodated in sub-acute or rehabilitation facilities; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services. This will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for those on waiting lists and the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which the waiting list initiative should be operated in future.</P>
      <P>The policy circular and guidelines, issued by my Department on 7 January 1999, outline revised and updated procedures in relation to improving the liaison and communication arrangements between acute hospitals and general practitioners; ensuring a more effective management of waiting lists at acute hospital level through the appointment of an implementation group and a patient co-ordinator/bed manager in each hospital; improved management of out-patient waiting lists and clarifying the criteria for inclusion on a public in-patient waiting list.</P>
      <P>The policy circular reiterates the targets of treating adults in target specialities within 12 months and of treating children in target specialties within six months. It clarifies the criteria for including patients on a public waiting list but, contrary to some recent reports, it makes no substantive changes to these criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospital consultants must manage their in-patient and out-patient lists in accordance with the recent policy circular and guidelines. It is a matter for each consultant to assess patients on their out-patient waiting lists and to determine whether they require treatment on an in-patient basis. I am not aware of any consultants adopting a prac<Col N="154" /> tice of refusing to accept patients on their waiting lists.</P>
    <P>In relation to placing patients on trolleys, I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum. Priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention, but because of the unpredictable nature of hospital workloads it can happen that patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of more appropriate beds. I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to make patients as comfortable as possible while they are awaiting a hospital bed.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures which I have outlined above under the waiting list initiative will help to reduce waiting times and free up appropriate facilities for patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards pay subventions towards the cost of maintaining older persons in private nursing homes. The rate of subvention, which is intended as a contribution rather than meeting the full cost of care, is £70, £95 and £120 per week depending on whether the older person is assessed as being of medium, high or maximum dependency. The cost of maintaining an older person in a private nursing home is not generally comparable to that of a health board long-stay nursing unit. Health board homes provide a range of ancillary services such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, etc., with a wider range of staff employed. Such services are not generally provided in the private nursing home sector. In general, patients admitted to public nursing units tend to be more dependent, thus requiring a greater level of nursing care. The cost in public nursing units or long-stay hospitals vary considerably, from high-dependency units such as South Circular Road, Dublin, at £402 per week or St. Mary's, Mullingar at £410 per week, to less dependent units such as Edenderry at £288 per week. These are gross figures, from which an old age pension contribution can normally be deducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind the demographic trends, I am well aware of the need to increase the supply of public long-stay nursing facilities for older people. The capital allocation to services for older people has been doubled from £7 million in 1997 to £14 million in 1998. Several new community <Col N="155" /> nursing units have been opened in recent years and another one will open at St. Clare's, Ballymun, in the next month or two. New units are under construction at Clonmel, Achill and Killybegs. Another important aspect of the capital programme is to replace old, unsatisfactory accommodation with new, modern facilities and such work has started, or is being planned, at locations such as Birr, Cavan and Enniscorthy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 101, 554, 578, 635 and 636 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the number of bed closures and resulting bed days lost in December 1998, for 1998 as  a whole, and associated with nursing <Col N="156" /> shortages in 1998 are set out in the following tables.</P>
    <P>The corresponding figures for the month of January 1999 are not yet available. In considering the delivery of service in the acute hospital sector, it is appropriate to examine the overall level of service provided in the sector rather than to simply focus on the number of beds available at any given time. This reflects major changes that have been taking place in medical practice, resulting in reduced average in-patients lengths of stay, a continuing shift in the delivery of care from an in-patient to day case basis and the increasing provision of treatment at out-patient level. In developing and delivering service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patients, day case and out-patient care is a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity. As part of this process, activity in the acute hospital sector is planned over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. In achieving the activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures would form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local management as part of their efforts to optimise the overall activity delivered within the resources available. They also, of course, facilitate staff annual leave, refurbishment works and the scaling down of elective activity at times of low demand such as the high summer period and at Christmas. I am confident however that, given the level of increased funds I have made available to the acute hospital sector this year over last year, the level of temporary bed closures will be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Total discharges, both in-patient and day case, in the acute hospital system for the period January to October 1998 were 676,635 which represents an increase of 3 per cent over the same period in 1997. In other words, irrespective of any temporary bed closures that occurred during that time, over 3 per cent more patients received treatment in our acute hospitals. Within this overall increase, there was an increase of almost 1 per cent in the number of patients treated at inpatient level and an increase of just over 12 per cent in the number of patients treated on a day case basis. This marked shift towards the increased provision of treatment on a day care basis underlines the inappropriateness of available bed numbers as an accurate measure of what is happening in the acute hospital sector. It is in this context that the performance of acute hospitals in 1998 should be judged. In agreeing service plans for 1999 with agencies in the acute hospital sector, my fundamental concern is to ensure that they will again deliver a level of service to patients commensurate with the funding being provided to them. In relation to bed closures as a direct result of nursing shortages, the figures provided indicate that a total of 4,738 bed days were lost during 1998, representing a monthly average of 22 beds nationally or 0.18 per cent of the total <Col N="157" /> bed complement. It is evident that the impact of nursing shortages is mainly concentrated in the Dublin area and is having some limited impact on the ability to perform elective work in the main hospitals affected. While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual <Col N="158" /> employers, in response to the current situation, the Health Service Employers' Agency, HSEA, has established a task force to examine the full nature of the difficulties and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 91 and 561 together.</P>
      <P>I fully support the concept of community rating and I am satisfied that, as concluded by the Advisory Group on Risk Equalisation, risk equalisation is necessary to protect the stability of community rating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding recent developments in relation to risk equalisation is that my Department wrote to VHI and BUPA in mid-December 1998 advising that, on foot of analysis of the returns received by its actuarial advisers at the end of November, in respect of claims paid in the quarter July-September 1998, that criteria envis<Col N="168" /> aged to determine the commencement of risk equalisation were satisfied during that quarter.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out to both insurers that this situation occurred in circumstances where risk equalisation arrangements were currently under review in the context of the White Paper on private health insurance. Accordingly, I was of the view that to proceed with such arrangements at this stage would not be consistent with the effective and proper completion of the review process and that it would be inappropriate to commence risk equalisation based on arrangements that could be subject to change or modification.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these circumstances, I decided that the most appropriate course of action would be to advise that the Health Insurance Act, 1994 (Risk Equalisation) Scheme, 1996, would be replaced. It was notified to the insurers concerned, that this course of action was being pursued with the clear intention that, as part of the process, my Department would issue, during the current month, a detailed technical paper on proposed changes. It will be open to the interested parties to discuss this with my Department in connection with its finalisation of the proposals by the end of February. It is envisaged that revised risk equalisation regulations will be in place by the end of May.</P>
    <P>My Department issued the detailed technical paper to interested parties on 22 January. The proposals which my Department has formulated are aimed at achieving an effective and sustainable balance between stability and competition in our particular market circumstances. The objective of change being implemented in this area is the maintenance of effective protection of community rating against preferred risk selection and the further encouraging of competition.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about when risk equalisation payments are likely to commence. The chosen method for the commencement of risk equalisation is based on the occurrence of certain circumstances in the market which primarily relate to differences in the risk profiles of insurers as indicated by comparative claims experience. The original arrangements envisaged risk equalisation commencing in respect of claims paid in the quarter April to June 1999, with the initial phased payment falling due by 30 September 1999. Under the revised proposal it is not possible to predict at this stage when risk equalisation would commence as this will depend on future market conditions. Under the proposed revised arrangements, the earliest date by which risk equalisation could commence would be in respect of claims incurred in the period October to December 1999 for which payment would be due by 30 March 2000.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on private health insurance will include legislative proposals on risk equalisation on the lines indicated in, and pursuant to the discussions held on, the technical paper. As regards progress on the preparation of the White Paper, I am pleased to say that a considerable <Col N="169" /> amount of work has been done. My Department received 70 submissions and has held consultation meetings with 25 organisations and individuals in connection with the preparation of the White Paper. There has also been discussions with other interested Departments in the matter. In the absence of a determination by the Government as to the content and publication of the White Paper, I consider that it would be inappropriate and premature of me to comment on the outstanding issues to be resolved. However, the Deputy is undoubtedly familiar with the many complex issues which relate to the current structure and operation of our private health insurance market. It is my intention that work on the preparation of the White Paper will be completed shortly and that it will be ready for decision by Government by the end of March.</P>

      <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit, has been involved in a number of initiatives to improve the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland including the production of materials encouraging breastfeeding. The training pack for health professionals to which the Deputy refers was produced and developed by the Centre for Health Promotion Studies, National University of Ireland, Galway, in conjunction with the Health Promotion Unit and An Bord Altranais. The pack was funded by the Health Promotion Unit and is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers in breastfeeding. It is recognised that the support of health professionals is critical to the success of the national breastfeeding policy as they are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and are ideally placed to ensure that the mother receives information about the benefits of breastfeeding in order that she can make an informed choice. Copies of the materials have been widely disseminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, which is a global campaign lead by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF to encourage hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed, has been recently established in Ireland. Participation in this initiative was recommended in the national breastfeeding policy for <Col N="170" /> Ireland and I am confident that participation in this initiative will result in an increase in the incidence of breastfeeding in this country. There are no plans, at this stage, to initiate a breastfeeding awareness campaign.</P>

      <Quest>if he will distinguish between pay and non-pay costs in his explanation in view of the fact that acute hospital costs increased by 46 per cent between 1993 and 1998, whereas inflation was 12.5 per cent; and if he will statistically distinguish the cost increase attributable to increased quality and activity levels from those as a result of medical inflation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1051/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for acute hospital spending quoted by the Deputy are compiled on a global basis and are not broken down between pay and non-pay costs. There are pay and non-pay figures available in respect of voluntary hospitals which are published annually in the Revised Estimates for the public service. It should be noted that these do not include regional and county hospitals administered by the health boards. Over the period 1993 to 1998 the total increase for these hospitals was 51 per cent which was made up of a 48 per cent increase in pay, including superannuation and PRSI costs, and a 73 per cent increase in non-pay costs.</P>
      <P>These are overall increases and do not distinguish between the increases in pay and non-pay which went towards maintaining existing services and standards of service and the increases which went towards developing new services and improving the quality of services. This is the key distinction required if the costs associated with medical inflation are to be separated from costs attributable to service improvements, as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, reliable estimates tracking medical inflation in the Irish public health system do not exist. In a previous reply, I gave the figures quoted by the Deputy in his question and I explained the particular measurement difficulties which arise in calculated medical inflation. It is a feature of all health systems that it is extremely difficult to disentangle cost increases attributable to medical inflation from increases in cost associated with improvements in the level or quality of service. To take an example, the cost of treating a particular disease may increase but this may, in part, be driven by the adoption of new technologies which bring about improvements in patient outcomes and/or increased activity levels. If account is only taken of the increase in cost and no allowance is made for the improvement in service the impression will be created that the cost of delivering existing services has increased whereas the introduction of this new treatment has actually changed the level and quality of service received by patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> I would stress that these difficulties are not unique to the Irish health services. The OECD, the recognised international experts in this field, have commented that:</P>
    <P>. . . . the largest part of productivity gains in hospitals goes statistically unrecorded. It is therefore not surprising that measured prices of health services steadfastly increase, notwithstanding the impressive pace of innovation resulting, for example, in new products enabling surgeons to save more lives, in reduced mortality rates in intensive-care units, and in unit cost reductions, such as shorter stays in hospital.</P>
    <P>Since the development of modern health services a belief has grown up that these services are capable of consuming huge amounts of extra resources with little or no appreciable gain in terms of increased output and improvements in health. This belief is not backed up by the evidence which is available but it partly arises because of genuine difficulties in precisely measuring increases in output and, to an even greater extent, improvements in the health status of patients. This underlines the importance of continuing to develop more precise measures of performance in the health sector.</P>
    <P>In this regard last year four major voluntary hospitals &ndash; Beaumont, the Mater, St. James's and St. Vincent's &ndash; did an initial review which sheds some light on the very real achievements of our hospitals over recent years. The allocations of these hospitals were examined between 1994 and 1997 and on average allocations were seen to have increased by 34 per cent. However, when factors such as pay increases, non-pay inflation, the impact of new legislation for example, health and safety legislation, and staff training were excluded the overall increase in funding was just over 4 per cent. While there might be some change in the precise figures following further refinement and incorporation of other hospitals I think they clearly highlight the efficiencies and service improvements being achieved by hospitals against a background of limited resources and growing demands from the public.</P>
    <P>The evidence available on the productivity of these four hospitals during the period in question confirms this point. Against a background of an increase in funding, having excluded certain items, of 4 per cent the activity of these four hospitals showed significant change. The number of in-patients treated showed a 5 per cent reduction but the complexity of these cases increased by 7.5 per cent; the number of daycases treated increased by 25 per cent; the number of attendances at out-patient clinics showed a 5 per cent increase; and the number of laboratory and radiology tests increased by approximately 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>These productivity gains are indicative of the efficiencies being achieved throughout the hospital services. The OECD in its economic sur<Col N="172" /> vey of Ireland published in 1997 compiled a special report on the health services. The report noted that there had been very significant improvement in the productivity achieved in Irish hospitals. Average length of stay was seen to have been reduced by 26 per cent since 1980 and there was a 3 per cent annual increase in overall cases treated since 1987 driven by a quadrupling in day cases. The overall verdict of the OECD was that the Irish health service has resulted in good provision of health care at a relatively low cost to the tax payer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 115 and 544 together.</P>
      <P>In December, 1997 the Government established a Cabinet Committee to oversee the work of an interdepartmental working group whose task it would be to prepare a Green Paper on abortion. Work on drafting the Green Paper is proceeding. The process involves consideration of the constitutional, legal, medical, moral,  ethical and social issues which arise regarding abortion. When the drafting has been completed I intend to convene another meeting of the Cabinet Committee, when it will commence consideration of the draft. Publication of the Green Paper must await a final decision of the Government in due course. I acknowledge that the process is taking longer than expected but I would point out that any dates given by me are at all times indicative, pending final approval by Government. It is the Government's intention to refer the Green Paper, when completed, to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office for National Statistics, London, has indicated that statistics on the number of abortions carried out in the calendar year 1998 are <Col N="173" /> not yet available. Figures for the period from 1 January to 30 June 1998 indicate that 2,953 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in that period. A total of 5,336 women who gave Irish addresses had abortions in England and Wales in 1997.</P>
    <P>I have made an additional £1 million (\1,269,738) available to the health boards in 1999 for the further development of family planning and pregnancy counselling services. The health boards have been asked to concentrate this additional funding on measures aimed at reducing the rate of unplanned pregnancy in women aged between 15 and 34 years, as the majority of abortions performed on Irish women involve women in this age-group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>The compilation of data on adult homelessness is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The nature and extent of the problem of homeless young people varies between health boards and between community care areas. Because of the transient nature of the problem and the transient lifestyle of some young people it is difficult to estimate the number of homeless young people throughout Ireland and in particular on a city by city basis. It is recognised that the problem of homeless children/young people is most acute in the Eastern Health Board region followed by the Southern Health Board region. In 1998, an average of eight young people per night presented to the social work service operating outside normal office hours and the Eastern Health Board estimates that 400 young people are out of home in the region each year. In the Southern Health Board 115 referrals were made during 1998.</P>
      <P>In general, when homeless children and young people come to the attention of a health board, every effort is made to reunite them with their family or to arrange to have them placed in foster care or residential care as appropriate. Social work support, advice, information, financial support and counselling to include counselling and mediation for families and individuals is offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> Since 1993, and up to the end of 1997, an additional allocation of £43.5 million revenue on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of childcare and family support services including services for the young homeless. A further £8 million was made available for this purpose in 1998 and £13 million has been made available in 1999.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in the Eastern Health Board include an emergency residential centre for children under 12 years of age opened earlier this month on the grounds of Peamount Hospital. Agreement has been reached between the Eastern Health Board and the Salvation Army for the provision of a reception centre and six overnight beds for use by the out of hours services. The overnight beds service is now operating. Additional facilities such as a day reception centre providing food, shelter and a gateway to other relevant services and emergency accommodation for boys will be opening in the near future at other locations in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board currently provides a range of support services to young people who present as homeless, which can be accessed through the board's homeless adolescent unit &ndash; a dedicated social work service who work directly with young people who are homeless or who are at risk from being homeless. Initiatives provided include access to emergency shelter, semi/ supported accommodation options and longer term independent living options as well as a range of financial supports for clothing, food and accommodation.</P>
    <P>A forum on youth homelessness has now been established in the Eastern Health Board region with representation from the key voluntary organisations, Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board. It is my intention to launch a series of new initiatives for homeless youth in 1999. I will be working with the health boards and relevant voluntary agencies to prepare details which I will then announce.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion at its meetings on 10 June 1998, decided to adopt a proposal from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for an initiative in relation to adult homelessness, viz. the development of an integrated response to the many issues which affect homeless people and to cover issues such as</P>
    <P>&ndash;suitable responses to homelessness, including emergency, transitional and long-term responses,</P>
    <P>&ndash;secondary issues which have a particular effect on homeless people including health, education, employment, home-making.</P>
    <P>A cross-department team under the chairmanship of the Department of the Environment and Local Government was set up to develop measures, in consultation with the appropriate statutory agencies and expert groups and to report back to the Cabinet committee on these measures, including estimated costs and available funding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> In the Eastern Health Board area, a joint Eastern Health Board/Dublin Corporation homeless initaitive was established in 1996. The purpose of this initiative is to achieve more effective services for adult homeless people through analysis, plannign and the development of a strong and effective partnership between all the agencies involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 613 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to reassure the Deputy that existing legislation already ensures that hospitals cannot enter into contracts of employment with unregistered doctors. Ireland has a very strict regulatory regime which ensures that only competent and properly qualified medical staff can work in the country. No doctor is allowed to practice medicine without being registered in Ireland by the Medical Council. </P>
      <P>The council was established under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 and registers doctors who qualify from Irish medical schools. It also registers doctors who have been educated and trained in other jurisdictions before they can practice medicine in Ireland. The Medical Council has authority to register doctors from other EU member states who have rights to practice here under EU freedom of movement directives. I know that the council works closely with registration bodies in other jurisdictions, including the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once properly registered a doctor is entitled to practice here. For those doctors seeking employment in the public hospital system, as for any <Col N="176" /> other prospective employee, it is the responsibility of employing authorities to check references and previous employment histories of candidates prior to employing them. Specifically in relation to hospital consultants, the Department have recently reiterated to employers the need to ensure that these matters are in order prior to consultants taking up duty on either a permanent or locum basis.</P>
    <P>The Local Appointments Commission processes a number of senior medical posts on behalf of the health service employers. Their procedures for hospital consultant posts places the requirement on each candidate to supply three references in advance of the interview stage. For other posts, where the volume of applications would make this procedure prohibitive, the commission carries out these checks on the successful candidate or candidates in advance of making a final recommendation to the employer.</P>
    <P>Both the Local Appointments Commission and the Health Service Employers Agency consider it good recruitment practice to obtain references from new appointees and continue to promulgate this practice among health service employers.</P>

    <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche provided the Department (and indeed the Hospital) with a number of drafts of sections of the report for purposes of verification of factual information and confirmation of any omissions. This was in line with the policy <Col N="177" /> of Deloitte &amp; Touche to ensure the quality and accuracy of the report.</P>
    <P>The first draft was received on 2 November 1998. This was comprised of extracts of different sections of the report.</P>
    <P>The sections provided were considered by the relevant divisions in the Department whose staff had been involved in the issues covered by the section e.g. capital expenditure, finance, personnel, information systems/information technology. Some sections proved more difficult than others to provide necessary confirmation e.g. capital expenditure and pay.</P>
    <P>Following feedback and review by the consultants, two further revised drafts of the sections of the report were received. The process outlined above was then repeated.</P>
    <P>Four meetings took place with the consultants prior to receipt of the first draft. Two of these meetings were held to provide initial briefing on the review and to discuss contractual arrangements. The other two meetings were to establish the format of the review and to provide relevant background material.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to receipt of the first draft, five full meetings took place with Deloitte &amp; Touche to provide feedback as required above.

In addition to the above, Department officials met with Deloitte &amp; Touche on two occasions as part of facilitation group meetings on the report.</P>

      <P>Under section 67 of the 1970 Health Act pre-school and national school children are eligible for health board dental services in respect of defects noted at child health examinations.</P>
      <P>Dental treatment services for children in national schools are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. For the past number of years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools. Children in second, fourth and sixth classes are targeted for <Col N="178" /> preventive measures under the school based approach.</P>
    <P>Subject to available resources the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme. The eight health boards work in close co-operation with the school authorities in their regions to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school. The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment, etc. provided as necessary.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that the school based targeted approach is the most effective way of delivering dental services to children at primary school level.</P>

      <P>The provision of renal dialysis at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. A new dialysis unit was opened there in March 1997, catering for 32 patients per week as part of the major capital development at the hospital.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 114 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>This Government's policy on the care of older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence at home with the support of the community care services where necessary and where this is no longer possible, to ensure they have access to the best possible medical or long-term care. This has been the policy adopted by successive Governments since the publication, in 1988, of a report on the development of services for older people entitled &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The number of elderly and chronically sick patients in each acute hospital who require long-term nursing home care or who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs is set out on the attached table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the review group on the waiting list initiative was recently published and the Government is committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented. It pointed out, <i>inter alia</i>, that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care. Accordingly, I have provided extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people <Col N="180" /> which will be an important factor in helping to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards. There are also a number of chronic sick in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of identifying and securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months.</P>
    <P>With regard to discharge planning and liaison between the acute hospital and community sectors, the report of the review group also pointed out that some progress had been made in relation to improving arrangements in this area but noted that few hospitals appeared to have a clearly defined policy in this regard. It recommended that health boards and voluntary hospitals should develop clear written policies on planning the discharge of elderly patients and liaising with the relevant community based services.</P>
    <P>I am assured that arrangements for the discharge of elderly patients are in place in all acute hospitals. Notice of discharge varies from site to site with some discharges being arranged at short notice in circumstances where there may be increased demand for admissions to acute beds through accident and emergency departments in some hospitals. I want to assure the Deputy however, that no elderly patient is discharged without an assessment of his or her future needs being undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 631 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> The position is that the existing drugs cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes will be merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit.</P>
    <P>The primary aim of the new drug payment scheme is to bring about important improvements in the existing schemes. The new scheme will effectively merge the best elements of the two existing schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    <P>The new family scheme will have significant advantages over the existing drugs refund scheme. Under the drugs refund scheme, families and individuals pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board of expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. Many families and individuals have very heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and have to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter before they receive a refund. This can cause considerable cash flow problems for a significant number of families and individuals. This will not happen under the new drug payment scheme. From the introduction of the new scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines. It means that families and individuals will, for the first time, be able to budget for the cost of medicines. Families and individuals will know that, whatever the size of their drugs bill, they will not have to pay more than £42 per month. In addition there are families where, although one member may qualify for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card, combined expenditure on medicines by other members, which can be considerable, cannot be recouped until the end of the quarter. With the new drug payment scheme, no family will have to pay more than £42 in any month for prescribed medicines. The new scheme will be of significant benefit to such families.</P>
    <P>The fact that the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the current drugs refund scheme. Under the drugs refund scheme, a family or an individual could, for example in one month have expenditure of say £80 but no expenditure in the other two months. They would not have been entitled to a refund. Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
    <P>There are no qualifying criteria for inclusion on the new drug payment scheme. Where expenditure by a family or an individual exceeds £42 per month on prescribed medicines, the balance will be met by the State. This is in contrast to the old DCSS scheme, where patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase in the threshold, the position is that there has been no increase in the threshold for the existing schemes since 1991. It must also be borne in mind that the new thres<Col N="183" /> hold refers to family expenditure as opposed to the existing threshold in the drug cost subsidisation scheme which relates to individual expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate the number of people that will be affected by the increased threshold in the new scheme, as the statistics in respect of claims under the drugs refund scheme refer to the number of claims and not to the number of individuals. Given the benefits of the new scheme that I have outlined above, I would point out that the new scheme is designed to be more user-friendly for individuals and families incurring expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of £42 per month. Accordingly, it is reasonable to expect that the uptake for the new scheme will be broadly in line with the combined uptake of the drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses (general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc.) due to a long-term medical condition these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card. In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Wall</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 93 of 18 November 1998, he will give details of the number, location and cost of the new day and residential places for persons with a mental handicap provided in 1997 and 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1967/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information related to the provision of new residential-respite and day places sought by the Deputy has been compiled by my Department and is set out below by health board area. It includes the location of or agency providing these services and the costs in each year associated with putting them in place.</P>
      <P>The costs associated with the provision of new residential-respite or day places for persons with a mental handicap can vary greatly and are dependent on a number of factors including &ndash; the category of mental handicap; &ndash; additional needs associated with challenging behaviour, physical or sensory disabilities or medical conditions. Account should also be taken of the fact that in some cases, new services are introduced on a phased basis, with the full cost of the service being provided over a two year period. In these cases, care is taken to ensure that in accounting for the actual number of places, there is no double counting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> In the case of the 1998 data, there may still be some small adjustments to be made. If, following further consultation with the health boards, this is the case, I will let the Deputy have details of these adjustments.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Health and Children in 1997 and the end of 1998, I allocated £25 million additional funding for services to persons with a mental handicap. This is more than double the additional funding allocated by the previous Government in 1997.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the number of cardiac operations postponed in the Mater Hospital during 1998 due to both nursing shortages and financial stringencies; the number of patients affected still awaiting cardiac surgery; and the action, if any, he will take to address the difficulties experienced by the hospital.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1378/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities regarding this matter and I have been advised that the hospital was unable to meet its agreed baseline activity for 1998 of 1,000 cardiac surgery cases due to nursing shortages. I have been further advised that no cardiac surgery operations were cancelled at the hospital during 1998 due to financial stringencies.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the nursing shortages, I understand that the hospital had to reduce its cardiac patient workload from four to three patients per day during 1998. This resulted in 890 baseline activity patients being treated last year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will wish to know that officials from my Department met with the hospital authorities earlier this month to discuss arrangements for dealing with the cardiac waiting list during 1999 in an effort to ensure that the baseline activity levels are achieved this year.</P>
      <P>In this context, my Department expressed concern about those patients who are waiting in excess of 12 months for cardiac surgery operations and requested that their circumstances be considered in the context of any initiatives undertaken in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 1998 I allocated funding of £2.3 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative, with the specific aim of reducing the national cardiac surgery waiting list for adults and children. In 1999, I have made provision for the allocation of £4 million under the cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and I am confident that this funding will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. Despite the difficulties at the Mater Hospital in recent months, referred to above, the impact of the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative was to reduce the overall numbers waiting (adults and children) at the end of the September 1998 by 349. This rep<Col N="190" /> resents a reduction of 22 per cent on the figure for September 1997.</P>
    <P>The problem of nurse shortages is an issue which has become more apparent in recent times. While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, the overall issue of the availability of nurses is being kept under review by the Health Service Employers' Agency (HSEA). In response to current difficulties, the HSEA has established a task force to examine the full nature of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that last week I launched the competitions for places on this year's nursing diploma programmes. I also announced an increased annual maintenance grant of £3,250 payable to nursing students and the provision of funding of £350,000 to An Bord Altranais and various schools of nursing for a recruitment campaign, at both national and local level, aimed at attracting more young people to enter nursing. I am hopeful that these initiatives will result in a successful outcome to this year's competitions and a full uptake of all the available training places.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that Ireland is not in a unique position in relation to the shortage of nurses. The reality is that the United States, the United Kingdom and most other European countries are also experiencing a shortage of nursing personnel. Nurses with specialist qualifications in areas such as cardiac care are particularly sought after.</P>
    <P>Pay rates for staff nurses are higher here than in the UK and a number of other European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. However, there are indications that nurses are leaving Dublin and taking up posts in rural areas. The cost of housing, traffic difficulties and the lack of car parking spaces are seen as disincentives to taking up posts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The strength of the economy is also having an impact on the availability of nurses. Nurses have enhanced mobility by virtue of their education, training and skills. In the current economic boom, they are much sought after by pharmaceutical and related companies in the private health sector, as well as by commercial concerns in other sectors.</P>
    <P>Arising from the work of the task force, the HSEA outlined to the nursing unions in November 1998 a number of initiatives to address the shortage, including the standardisation of overtime rates and full incremental credit on permanent appointment for relevant previous nursing experience both at home and abroad. In addition, the HSEA has agreed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. The HSEA expects to be in a position to announce details of this scheme shortly.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the difficulties in recruiting nurses being experienced by hospitals, it should be noted that my Department has recently engaged a nurse researcher to specifically study <Col N="191" /> nursing needs for the coming years and to carry out research on the reasons why nurses are leaving their profession. When this research has been completed, my Department will be in a better position to further address the issue of nursing shortages.</P>

      <QRef>[1993/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 136, 576 and 611 together.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment I received one request to meet with representatives of the tobacco industry. I declined this request and instructed officials to meet with them instead. The meeting took place with officials on 23 September 1997. The meeting dealt mainly with smoking among children but no decisions were taken and no assurances given. No memorandum or submission other than the transactions mentioned below, have been furnished to me or my Department during my term of office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> On taking office I established a group of health experts to consider all aspects of tobacco and health policy. This group is known as the smoke free policy group and is addressing all aspects of tobacco policy including passive smoking in the workplace. The group expects to have a report for me shortly. The group is chaired by a senior civil servant and is comprised solely of health experts. It has not met with any interest groups nor sought submissions, though it has considered representations made to me concerning possible litigation by the State against the tobacco industry.</P>
    <P>Department officials had another meeting on 11 February 1998 with tobacco industry representatives. This meeting took place at the request of the tobacco industry about a complaint by one tobacco company against another over alleged illegal distribution of free tobacco products. My officials made it clear that the practice was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>On 30 November 1998 Department officials met with the representative of the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Council (ITMAC) concerning the failure of the ITMAC companies to comply with a request under section 5 of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act 1988 to disclose the ingredients in tobacco products. This meeting took place at the request of the Department. This is an ongoing matter and papers are currently being prepared for referral to the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>At that meeting an incident at a function for a student group from University College Dublin, where free tobacco products were reportedly supplied illegally to students, was raised by my officials. The industry was cautioned to co-operate fully with the ongoing investigation by an officer of the Eastern Health Board and I am awaiting the investigating officer's report.</P>
    <P>I understand that informal contacts with the industry by way of telephone conversations occur from time to time as minor matters arise.</P>
    <P>The consultative group referred to by the Deputy is no longer in existence and the question of smoking in the workplace is currently being assessed by the smoke free policy group.</P>
    <P>For good operational reasons it has long been practice with the Department to meet from time to time with representatives of the tobacco industry but it would not be possible to give precise details of meetings without a detailed search of many files in the Department which would involve an inordinate expenditure of resources.</P>
    <P>I have had meetings about smoking with other groups since becoming Minister for Health and Children such as ASH and the national newspapers of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that applications for national lottery grants far exceed resources and as the funds available for 1998 have been disbursed it was not possible to assist in this particular case.</P>
      <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association (Castlebar Branch) was informed of the position by my Department in a letter dated 7 January 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the time of the emergence of the HIV virus as a potential threat to the health of healthcare workers, the Department of Health and Children, health service employers and the health professions have taken all possible and necessary measures to minimise the risk of infection. These measures have been taken to protect the health of patients and healthcare workers.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the Minister for Health established an advisory group on the transmission of infectious diseases in the healthcare setting. The purpose of the group was to advise the Minister for Health and Children regarding the prevention of transmission of infectious diseases in the healthcare setting. The group's report was published in January 1997. It stated a general set of principles which should underpin the approach to the protection of patients and healthcare workers in relation to blood-borne viruses. This group was asked to concentrate on the hepatitis B virus and did not make specific recommendations regarding the HIV and hepatitis C viruses.</P>
      <P>On 17 December 1996, the Minister for Health announced the establishment of a new group to report on the further measures which need to be taken in relation to a range of issues not addressed by the advisory group and which will also function as a central resource for the foreseeable future. The group was asked to ensure that there was an integrated and complementary approach to dealing with the service, personnel, ethical and legal matters arising from healthcare workers and patients in relation to infectious diseases. The group completed a draft report in December 1997 which was circulated to interested parties for their observations. The group reviewed the observations received and took account of further scientific developments. The group has recently completed this assignment and its report will be published in February. As this group's original terms of reference envisaged that it would remain available as a source of advice and expertise, I do not see any need for a further committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> I am satisfied that all necessary steps were taken to protect both healthcare workers and patients in the small number of instances where a staff member was found to have been infected by the HIV virus.</P>

      <QRef>[1874/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen): I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 121 together.</P>
    <P>The recent Deloitte &amp; Touche report on Tallaght Hospital comprehensively dealt with the funding issues involved for the new hospital.</P>
    <P>The issues covered in the report encompass the process of funding, the basis of funding, the amount of funds made available and the management process used by the hospital to prepare the 1998 service plan and the controls on expenditure at the new hospital.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the report that the hospital did not consider that it had an obligation to adhere to the terms of the letter of determination, which set out, <i>inter alia</i>, the funding available for 1998. The report also makes clear that the Department examined different options with regard to the basis for funding the hospital in that year. The position is that the option most favourable to the hospital was adopted by the Department. I am satisfied that the funding allocated to the hospital last year was adequate to run the hospital for six months at its new location in Tallaght and the base hospitals until 21 June 1998. The level of funding compared very favourably with other hospitals undertaking similar volumes and complexity of work and made allowance for the additional expenditure involved in establishing services at the new location.</P>
    <P>The hospital was notified of its non-capital determination for 1999 on 23 December 1998 in the sum of £64.690 million. A further £3.916 million was approved in respect of the spending in relation to the federated Dublin voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputies should be aware that almost all of this latter amount refers to staffing at the Tallaght <Col N="196" /> Hospital. The total amount available to the hospital for 1999 is, therefore, approximately £69 million. Given the hospital's case mix and state of the art facilities, I am satisfied that this amount is sufficient to meet pay and non-pay costs, including the full year costs of 1998 service developments. The hospital's service plan is due in my Department within the coming weeks, following which officials will meet the hospital management to review the plan.</P>
    <P>This determination was made in the context of the significant excess expenditure incurred in 1998, the findings and recommendations in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, and the agreement reached with the board of management on 18 December, as reflected in the joint statement issued on that day, concerning the way forward.</P>
    <P>In particular, the hospital was advised that the determination is designed to meet the costs of maintaining approved services at the hospital through 1999. It does not include any provision for the further development of services; it has been agreed that the detail of any such developments will be the subject of further discussions with my Department when it is clear that the recommendations in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report have been fully implemented to my satisfaction.</P>

      <Quest>his views on a clinical audit policy in relation to all surgical procedures; his further views on whether patients have a right to know the success rates for any individual surgeon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1943/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the development of clinical audit programmes at all levels across the health service, including the area of surgery. The need for development in this area is clearly identified in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future.</P>
      <P>I see clinical audit of surgical procedures as just one component of the overall quest for quality improvement in health care. In my view there are a number of prerequisites for the development of a clinical audit programme. These include commitment from hospital consultants, boards and management and the availability of accurate, timely and comparable activity data. The need, in particular, for directly comparable data is critical in assessing the success rates for specific surgical procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations in the strategy, a number of initiatives have been taken to promote and assist the development of clinical audit at hospital level. For example, the recent negotiated consultant's common contract requires public hospital consultants to participate in a process of clinical audit which is to be resourced and supported locally by the hospital management. The common contract further pro<Col N="197" /> vides for the extensive involvement of clinicians in hospital service management. My Department is currently engaged with health agencies on putting the structures in place which will allow for the implementation of these contractual undertakings.</P>
    <P>In addition a national database has been developed which records discharge information on all acute hospital in-patient and day case discharges. Under the hospital in-patient inquiry system a detailed information set is collected on demographic data, diagnostic data, and information on any procedure performed on a patient in the course of his or her hospital stay. This information is available to participating hospitals and is of considerable benefit in developing clinical audit programmes at individual hospital and health board level.</P>
    <P>In general the Irish acute hospital sector has compared favourably with its European counterparts over a range of measurement parameters. In line with a move internationally towards a more critical evaluation of outcomes I recently approved the development, on a pilot basis, of an accreditation system for the acute general hospital sector. The objective is to develop a system that would allow Irish hospitals to assess their overall performance against an objectively agreed set of standards and to create an environment of continuous review and improvement. The pilot scheme will initially be concentrated in the larger academic teaching hospitals but will be structured in a way that it will eventually encompass all hospitals in the public acute hospital sector or completion of the pilot phase. I am confident that the availability of a fully-fledged acute hospital accrediation programme will greatly assist in the development of individual quality improvement measures such as clinical audit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, 124, 130 and 575 together.</P>
      <P>The number of nurses employed in the public health service has increased steadily in recent years. Between 1990 and 31 December 1997, the whole-time equivalent number of nursing staff employed in the public health service increased from 24,732 to 27,426 &ndash; an increase of 2,694 or 11 per cent.</P>
      <P>In addition, there has been a major expansion in the number of practice nurses attached to GP surgeries around the country. There are currently some 455 such nurses working in this area.</P>
      <P>A factor which must be taken into account is the increasing trend among health service employers to facilitate nurses and midwives who, for personal reasons, do not wish to commit themselves to full-time work. There are currently some 4,000 nurses working in formal job-sharing arrangements, in addition to the significant number who work part-time.</P>
      <P>While the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for individual employers, the overall issue of the availability of nurses is being kept under review by the Health Service Employers' Agency (HSEA). In response to current difficulties, the HSEA established a task force to examine the full nature of the difficulties in recruiting nursing staff and to make recommendations on appropriate action.</P>
      <P>A HSEA survey of Dublin hospitals showed 448 vacant nursing posts on 15 January 1999. However, a survey of the same hospitals carried out one week later by my Department revealed a significant reduction in the number of vacant posts &ndash; down to 384 on 22 January 1999. This downward trend is consistent with the increase in the number of nurses applying to An Bord Altranais for registration.</P>
      <P>The returns from the Dublin hospitals indicate that there is a particular difficulty in recruiting nurses for specialist areas such as theatre, intensive care, coronary care, accident and emergency and paediatrics.</P>
      <P>Health board and voluntary hospitals outside of the Dublin area reported only a single nursing vacancy on the 22 January 1999; however, this is being clarified with them. They have indicated that while they have no difficulty in filling permanent nursing posts, occasional problems arise in recruiting temporary or locum staff to cover sick leave, annual leave and maternity leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident from the returns furnished to my Department that the nursing shortage in the hospital sector is mainly concentrated in the Dublin area. This reinforces the indications given to the HSEA by hospital management that nurses are leaving Dublin and taking up positions in rural areas. The cost of housing, traffic gridlock, <Col N="199" /> and the lack of car parking are seen as disincentives to taking up positions in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The strength of the economy is also having an impact on the availability of nurses. Nurses have enhanced mobility by virtue of their education, training and skills. In the current economic boom, they are much sought after by pharmaceutical and related companies in the private health sector, as well as by commercial concerns in other sectors.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not in a unique position in relation to the shortage of nurses. The reality is that the United States, the United Kingdom and most other European countries are also experiencing a shortage of nursing personnel. Pay rates for staff nurses are higher here than in the UK and a number of other European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that An Bord Altranais reports an increase in the number of nurses applying for registration which would suggest that nurses are returning from abroad. In 1998, the board received 1,400 applications for registration from nurses abroad, compared with 939 in 1996. Conversely, the number of Irish nurses going abroad dropped from 1,079 in 1996 to 850 in 1998.</P>
    <P>Arising from the work of the task group, the HSEA outlined to the nursing unions in November 1998 a number of initiatives to address the shortage, including the standardisation of overtime rates and full incremental credit on permanent appointment for relevant previous nursing experience both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>In addition, the HSEA has agreed to the introduction of more flexible working arrangements for nursing staff. The HSEA expects to be in a position to announce details of this scheme shortly. At present, the only options are full-time work or job-sharing. The absence of more flexible attendance patterns has been identified as a major obstacle to attracting nurses and midwives with family responsibilities back to work. The revised scheme about to be announced by the HSEA is designed to overcome this obstacle.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that my Department has engaged a nurse researcher to specifically study nursing and midwifery needs for the coming years, and to carry out research on the reasons nurses are leaving nursing and where they are going. A steering group has been established to oversee this study of the nursing and midwifery resource.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the transition from the traditional apprenticeship model of nursing training to the revised diploma based model was completed in all three pre-registration nursing disciplines. Successful completion of the three-year nursing registration diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais and the award of a diploma in nursing studies from the linked third level institution.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with my Department, An Bord Altranais has assumed responsibility for the overall management of the nursing applications <Col N="200" /> centre and has renamed it the nursing careers centre in order to give it a broader focus in relation to nursing as a career generally. This transfer of responsibility is in accordance with the strengthened role for An Bord Altranais in the area of pre-registration nursing education recommended by the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    <P>This year there will be a total of 1,142 training places available on the nursing diploma programmes &ndash; 781 in general nursing, 201 in psychiatric nursing and 160 in mental handicap nursing. Additional funding of £7.5 million has been provided by the Government this year, bringing to some £32 million the amount that will be spent on the programmes in 1999.</P>
    <P>Nursing students on the diploma programmes receive an annual maintenance grant as well as other financial supports. The value of this grant was £2,500 when it was first introduced in 1994. It remained at this level until 1998, when I increased it by 20 per cent to its present level of £3,000. On 20 January, I announced a further increase to £3,250 with effect from 1 April next. This maintenance grant, which is not subject to a means test, will therefore have been increased by 30 per cent within the lifetime of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I have also provided funding of £350,000 to An Bord Altranais and to various schools of nursing for a promotional campaign, at both local and national level, aimed at attracting more young people to nursing.</P>
    <P>As part of the preparations for this year's competitions, An Bord Altranais, with my approval, amended its own rules to revise the minimum educational requirements for entry to nursing training. The effect of this rule change is to expand the range of leaving certificate subjects that may be presented by an applicant for admission to the nursing diploma programmes. This rule change introduces greater flexibility in the entry criteria for nursing training, without reducing standards. In the context of attracting more entrants to nursing, a positive consequence of the recent rule change will be to increase the pool of school leavers and others who will be eligible for places on the nursing diploma programmes.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, an applicant for admission to the nursing diploma programmes must (a) have obtained in the leaving certificate examination a minimum grade of C3 in two higher level papers and a minimum grade of D3 in four ordinary or higher level papers in the following subjects: English or Irish; mathematics; a laboratory science subject and three other subjects, and (b) meet the minimum educational requirements specified by the third level institution concerned for entry to the programmes.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is possible to secure a nurse training place in the United Kingdom with a pass leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies will agree from what I have outlined that a considerable amount of preparatory work has been undertaken on a number of fronts in advance of the announcement of this <Col N="201" /> year's competitions for places in the nursing diploma programmes. I share the hope of everybody associated with the nursing careers centre that these efforts will result in a successful outcome to the competitions and a full uptake of all the available training places.</P>

      <P>Information on waiting lists for radiology and other diagnostic procedures is not routinely collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the authorities at St. Michael's Hospital that they operate a separate waiting list for public and private out-patients who require ultra sound facilities at the hospital. The waiting times for out-patient appointments are presently two months for public patients and two weeks for private patients. The hospital have advised me that in-patients at the hospital who require ultra sound facilities are seen without delay.</P>
      <P>Under existing eligibility arrangements regarding waiting lists for patients requiring out-patient treatment, a consultant's private out-patients may be treated in a public hospital either: (a) at a public clinic in accordance with their place on the overall waiting list for that clinic, or (b) at a time agreed with the hospital authority, outside of the consultant's public commitment.</P>
      <P>Any out-patient whose condition necessitates immediate treatment would, of course, receive priority regardless of public or private status.</P>

    <P>This report was conducted under the aegis of the Coombe Women's Hospital and funded by <Col N="203" /> the Department of Health. The study commenced in 1986 and was completed in 1992; it relates to the five year period 1981-1985. In view of the time which had elapsed between the commencement of the study and its completion it was decided not to publish the report.</P>
    <P>The report was, however, made available to the maternity and infant care scheme review group which considered, <i>inter alia</i>, the question of domiciliary births. In its report, which was circulated in 1997, the review group made recommendations in relation to domiciliary births. Funding has been provided in 1999 for the piloting of a number of the approaches suggested.</P>

      <Col N="204" /> While there is a legal requirement under the infectious diseases regulations 1981-1996 to notify cases of food poisoning generally, E.coli 0157 is not specifically notifiable. The question of designating E.coli 0157 as a notifiable disease will be among the issues considered by the national disease surveillance unit in the context of its review of the existing list of notifiable diseases. The review will commence this year.</P>
    <P>In July 1998 the scientific committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, through its microbiology sub-committee, established a task force to examine the issue of E.coli 0157 in the Irish context. I understand that the report of this task force is currently being finalised and will be available in the near future.</P>

      <P>The provision of epidural services at Tralee General Hospital is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board. The development of this service and obstetric services generally has been identified as a priority by the management of the hospital. In this regard, I have provided an additional £1.487 million in 1999 to meet the cost of service developments, including improved midwifery staffing levels at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Southern Health Board that in order to improve the availability of epidural services in Tralee General Hospital there are a number of issues surrounding the arrangements for the enhancement of the service which need to be clarified with the relevant clinical staff in the first instance. I have been advised by the Southern Health Board there are ongoing discussions between hospital management, the consultant anaesthetists and the consultant obstetrician/ gynaecologists, regarding the further development of this service. I look forward to the conclusion of these discussions and will consider any <Col N="205" /> proposal that the Southern Health Board may make following the conclusion of local discussions.</P>

      <P>I understand from inquiries to the health boards that the problem of children begging is mainly concentrated in the Eastern Health Board region, primarily in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has informed my Department that the number of children involved is relatively small and they come from a small number of families of the travelling community who are well known to the authorities. In general, the response of the Eastern Health Board has been to work with the travelling community directly and through relevant voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>The board, in conjunction with other agencies supports a pre-school and a school for approximately 60 traveller children, a resource centre which provides among other services an after-school and youth programme, a drop-in service, advice, counselling and a social work service. The board also provides financial assistance to the operating costs of residential centres for children from the travelling community.</P>
      <P>An aftercare programme for young members of the travelling community leaving residential care has been developed as well as a special foster care placement programme whereby traveller families foster traveller children.</P>

    <P>In addition, a forum on youth homelessness has now been established in the Eastern Health Board region with representation from the key voluntary organisations, Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board.

      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children I have delegated responsibility for the Child Care Act, 1991, and the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1991. The Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform also have major responsibilities relating to children. To facilitate a more consistent approach to child care issues, I was made Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform early last year. The powers delegated to me in those two Departments are listed in Statutory Instruments No. 29 and No. 30 of 1998.</P>
      <P>All Government Departments have responsibilities towards children. To give some examples, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has responsibility for the provision of children's playgrounds, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment deals with child labour laws and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is responsible for the children's allowance. Most Government Departments have responsibilities which impinge equally upon adults and children. It is not practicable to segregate the responsibilities vested in Ministers into those relating to children and those relating to adults.</P>

      <P>Filling of the post of chief executive at Tallaght Hospital is, in the first instance, a matter for the <Col N="207" /> board of management of the hospital. I assume that the board will deal with the matter appropriately. I have had no discussions with Dr. David McCutcheon in relation to his resignation, either prior to or subsequent to the announcement of his resignation.</P>
      <P>The hospital was notified of its non-capital determination for 1999 on 23 December 1998 in the sum of £64.690 million. A further £3.916 million was approved in respect of the spending in relation to the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals. The Deputy is aware that almost all of this latter amount refers to staffing at the Tallaght Hospital. The total amount available to the hospital for 1999 is, therefore, c£69 million. Given the hospitals casemix and state of the art facilities, I am satisfied that this amount is sufficient to meet the costs of maintaining at the hospital through 1999 all of the services which have been approved. The hospitals' service plan is due in my Department within the coming weeks, following which officials will meet the hospital management to review the plan.</P>
      <P>Without having sight of the hospital service plan, it is not appropriate for me to comment on what it may contain. Of course, I must await receipt of the service plan before I can comment on the specific measures proposed by the board to deal with the issues raised in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.</P>
      <P>Finally, the matter of securing the necessary commercial loan is a matter for the hospital board of management.</P>

      <P>The total number of acute beds in public hospitals in the Eastern Health Board area in January 1999 is 4,855. This is comprised of 4,548 in-patient beds and 307 day beds. This figure compares with 4,758 beds in 1989, comprised of 4,593 in-patient beds and 165 day beds. In 1979 there was a total of 6,500 acute beds in the Eastern Health Board area. According to the latest census figures (1996) the total population in the Eastern Health Board region is 1.3 million. This compares with a population total of 1.17 million in 1979 (census figure) and an estimated 1.23 million in 1989.</P>

    <P>Four acute general hospitals have closed and relocated since 1989. The services of the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospitals <Col N="208" /> transferred to Tallaght in 1998, while St. Anne's Hospital transferred to St. Luke's Hospital at the end of 1997. Tallaght Hospital is in the process of building 75 private/semi-private beds which is an additional facility to the hospital and is being developed and financed by the hospital itself.</P>

Exchequer capital spending on the health service infrastructure will total £525 million over the next three years and include provision for a number of major hospital developments in the North Dublin region. In this context, it is worth mentioning two major developments which are under way in North Dublin.</P>
    <P>First, the Deputy will be aware that in November 1997 I gave the go ahead for a further major capital development at the Mater Hospital. A design team has been appointed and it is currently involved in the preparation of a development control plan for the entire site, including the relocation of The Children's Hospital, Temple St. For planning and construction reasons, it will probably be necessary to undertake this major project in two phases. Every effort will be made to implement the second phase immediately following the completion of the first phase.</P>
    <P>In January 1998 I gave the go ahead to the capital development programme for James Connolly Memorial Hospital, which provides for the inclusion of new acute wards and the refurbishment of existing wards, new intensive care and coronary care units, a new accident and emergency department and a new department of physical medicine. Detailed accommodation briefs have been finalised for this development and are currently under consideration by my Department. The development will be on a phased basis with phase I scheduled for completion in 2001.</P>
    <P>While there are no plans for the development of a new hospital on the northside of Dublin or in the north County Dublin area in the immediate future, my Department is keeping the situation in relation to acute hospital services under review with regard to changes in demographics within the eastern region.</P>

      <P>The human assisted reproduction unit (HARI) at the Rotunda Hospital has provided a semen freezing service since 1997. The service is confined to men who would benefit from semen freezing; they include cancer patients who are at risk of being made infertile as a side-effect of their treatment and who may wish to have their sperm stored for their use in the future. The service is not governed by specific health legislation but operates under protocols drawn up by the HARI unit which include detailed guidelines on the storage and future use of the semen. The service is also governed by the medical council guidelines.</P>

      <P>The total number of designated acute hospital beds at 25 January 1999 was 12,286.</P>
      <P>A 1998 OECD statistical publication provided comparative information on hospital in-patient care, setting out the number of beds per 1,000 of population of each OECD member state in 1996. This describes Ireland as having 4.9 beds per 1,000 of population (based on 1995 figures) as against 4.7 beds per 1,000 of population in the United Kingdom and 4.2 beds per 1,000 of population in the United States of America. The overall average for all OECD member states was 7.98 beds per 1,000 of population. A deal of caution should be used in assessing these figures, owing to the fact that health systems deliver very different services in different countries. In addition, the demands of the public vary between countries with, for example, continental systems having to deal with much higher proportions of their population in the older age groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144, 549 and 567 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of national breast and cervical cancer screening programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> In relation to breast screening, phase I will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
    <P>Following the launch of the cancer action plan, a national steering committee, chaired by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, C.E.O., Western Health Board, was established to guide the implementation of the national programme of screening for breast cancer. Since its establishment, there have been a number of key developments. These include:</P>
    <P>(i)The passage of the Health (Provision of Information) Act, 1997 which faciltated the development of a population register. A population register for the programme has now been compiled. It is currently being validated and fine-tuned and will be operational by the time screening commences.</P>
    <P>(ii)A decision by the breast screening steering committee on a model of delivery for phase I of the programme in November 1997. It has been agreed that there will be two central units based at the Mater and St. Vincent's, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary team approach involving the relevant clinical disciplines, including the screening radiologist. In addition, there will be two mobile units to bring the screening services to the women in the more remote/rural areas within the three health boards in phase I. Each mobile unit will be linked with one of the central units. This should ensure uniformity of standards and continuity of care.</P>
    <P>(iii)The appointment of Dr. Jane Buttimer as project director for the programme in May 1998.</P>
    <P>(iv)The establishment of the programme as a legal entity (as a joint board under section 11 of the Health Act, 1970) in September 1998 to facilitate the appointment of consultant and support staff as well as for budgetary control and financial accountability reasons.</P>
    <P>(v)Preparation of quality assurance guidelines by the national QA committee, which is a sub-committee of the national steering committee. The final report has been completed and is being validated by external review.</P>
    <P>(vi)Advertisements for dedicated consultant and support staff for the programme were placed in the national press in late 1998. The recruitment process for the consultants is now under way and interviews should be completed by the end of January 1999.</P>
    <P>A key determinant regarding the start up date for the national breast screening programme will be the recruitment of the relevant consultant and support staff. I understand from the project director that once the relevant staff are ready to take up their apppointments we should be in a position to start the programme. It is hoped to start the breast screening programme in autumn 1999.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to making the necessary resources available to the breast screening programme to facilitate the commencement of screening and between 1997 and 1998 a total of £2 million was allocated on a once off basis to cover the start up costs and priority capital equipment.</P>
    <P>In addition, funding of £1,932,750 was approved in August 1998 for capital works at the two static sites (Mater Hospital: £1,035,000 and St. Vincent's Hospital: £897,750). In 1999, revenue funding of £3,940,000 is being allocated for the programme.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting Phase I of the programme in place.</P>
    <P>With regard to the establishment of the national cervical screening programme, the report of the Department of Health cervical screening committee was launched as part of the national cancer strategy in March, 1997. The report recommended the introduction of a national organised screening programme for women in the 25-60 age group at minimum intervals of five years.</P>
    <P>The programme is being piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board to identify and resolve any difficulties which might arise. The aim of the pilot project is to develop a cervical screening programme which runs successfully in the mid-west and can then be implemented throughout the rest of the country. It is expected that following two years experience of the pilot the introduction of the national cervical screening programme will commence.</P>
    <P>An expert advisory committee has been appointed, which will, <i>inter alia</i>, oversee the piloting of the programme. Staff have been recruited by the health board for the development, management and evaluation of the project. It is envisaged that screening will commence towards the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>This timescale will however depend on a number of factors including the completion of a population register, the development of IT systems, the recruitment of consultant histopathologists to the laboratories involved in the pilot and agreement being reached with the IMO on the participation of general practitioners in the pilot.</P>

    <P>Because of the level of detail involved, the information on the length of time spent by each child in hospital will be forwarded by letter to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>To avoid the inappropriate social admission of children to hospital the Eastern Health Board has very recently opened a ten bed short-term-emergency residential centre to care for children in crisis situations. The centre has a reserved number of beds which can be accessed during out of hours emergencies. The Garda has direct access to the new service which is reported to be operating well. In addition a number of foster families are available to provide emergency care. I will continue to monitor the situation during 1999.</P>

      <P>While it is generally accepted that worksharing offers a number of advantages for society and the economy through job creation, greater workplace flexibility and more equitable distribution of work, I do not have any immediate plans to introduce legislation on this specific issue.</P>
      <P>In January 1997 a package of measures, intended to facilitate greater worksharing in the public service, was announced. The practical application of these measures is a matter to be discussed and worked out with the appropriate trade unions for each of the various public service organisations. As regards the Civil Service, discussions are at present taking place between the Department of Finance and the Civil Service unions on the implementation of these measures which will build on the schemes already in place.</P>
      <P>Worksharing in the private sector is first and foremost a matter for that sector. The models developed in the public service provide an example of what can be achieved and I would urge the social partners to renew their efforts to conclude a framework agreement on this issue.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of atypical work, the Deputy may be aware that the EU Council has adopted a Directive concerning a Framework Agreement on Part-time Work which must be implemented in all member states by January, 2000. The purpose of the directive is to prevent part-time workers from being treated less favourably than full-time workers, to provide for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers and to improve the quality of part-time work.</P>

      <P>The people engaged in transposition in my Department normally do so as part of their duties in related work areas. Depending on priorities within areas and in the Department as a whole, the number engaged in transposition at any one time varies. However, I am satisfied that, within the limits imposed by the Government's policy to control public service numbers, and within the extensive work programme set out in my Department's strategy statement sufficient resources and personnel are available for transposition of EU Directives into Irish law. I regard the rate of progress of transposition as adequate.</P>

      <P>Variations in prices are to be expected in a competitive market. Consumers can and do become aware of these variations. Where significant variations in prices occur consumer power will send a message to the market.</P>
      <P>I note that the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland in releasing the results of their survey before Christmas highlighted the advice of their President to motorists &ldquo;when filling up, shop around&rdquo;. I agree with that advice.</P>

      <P>Mayday Management Consultants were commissioned in 1998, to carry out an economic scoping study of Kilmallock for the Kilmallock Association of Trade and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study is supported by Shannon Development, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Limerick County Enterprise Board, all of whom are actively involved with Kilmallock Association of <Col N="220" /> Trade and Commerce on the steering group for the study.</P>
    <P>In preparing the study, all sectoral activities including tourism, industry, heritage etc. were examined. The study is geared towards community development and is intended to highlight the potential for jobs and economic activity in the area.</P>
    <P>Once complete, it should serve as a very useful input to the work of  both the association and Shannon Development in pursuing these objectives.</P>
    <P>I understand that in December 1998, an interim report was presented to the Kilmallock Association of Trade and Commerce for observations, and these observations will be included in the consultants' final report which is scheduled for completion and presentation to the association in March 1999.</P>

      <P>At present a work permit must be obtained from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment by any employer who wishes to employ any person who is not a national of a member country of the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA comprises the member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work permits have, generally, only been issued in respect of prospective employees who have very specialised skills or qualifications which are <Col N="221" /> not readily available either here or elsewhere in the EU-EEA.</P>
    <P>Before issuing such permits employers are expected to demonstrate that they have made reasonable efforts to employ an Irish or other EEA national for the job and have been unable to do so. Details of the qualifications or special expertise of the individual who may be the subject of an application are also required. There are also requirements as to compliance with the relevant immigration legislation. These requirements apply to all non EEA nationals who may be the subject of a work permit application. There are no special requirements in respect of Chinese nationals.</P>
    <P>The current work permit regime is based on administrative practice and I will shortly be bringing proposals to Government to place these matters on a statutory footing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The post in respect of which the application was made was a general one for which specialist skills did not appear essential and which, it was felt, could be carried out by an Irish or other European Economic Area national. No details of any special qualifications for the job were submitted by the applicant. Neither was a CV in respect of the individual concerned submitted with the application. Furthermore, no evidence whatsoever was submitted by the applicant of any attempt to recruit an Irish or other EEA national for the job. Finally, it appeared that the person in <Col N="222" /> respect of whom the application was made had, in fact, already been working illegally in the establishment concerned in contravention of the relevant legislation [section 3 of the Aliens (Amendment) Order 1975].</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 165 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche review of community employment found that it is largely meeting its objective of providing temporary work experience and training for the long-term unemployed and socially excluded and enhancing their prospects of obtaining jobs in the open labour market. <Col N="226" /> The review also recommended that the number of places on the programme should be reduced by 6,000 to 8,000 to reflect the current buoyant labour market; and that to enhance the chances of participants in community employment subsequently finding jobs there should be a greater emphasis in the programme on training, progression and linkages to the labour market. FÁS is implementing these qualitative changes.</P>
    <P>There is no contradiction between reducing the number of places on community employment and fulfiling the terms of Paragraph 4.24 of P2000 to provide an additional 10,000 labour market interaction places over the lifetime of the programme. The challenge is to come up with places that best serve the interests of participants in getting a job and that also respond to the needs of the labour market. That is what the Government has sought to do in the 1999 Estimates and budget.</P>
    <P>In 1999 my Department will provide for an average of 37,500 places on community employment, a reduction of 2,500 on the 40,000 CE places at the time P2000 was agreed. The revised Estimate for my Department also provides for 10,275 additional places on other active labour <Col N="227" /> market initiatives, including 875 new job initiative places, 1,500 bridging programme places to enable long-term unemployed to enter mainstream training, 5,200 job club places including 800 specifically reserved for lone parents, and 800 part-time training places for lone parents. The objective is to enhance the range of places, to focus on programmes with the best employability outcomes and to target places at specific disadvantaged cohorts in the labour market.</P>
    <P>Since P2000 was agreed there has been an overall increase in labour market reintegration places for unemployed persons of at least 18,000 &ndash; i.e. Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment programme places plus back to work allowances and back to education allowance &ndash; with over 10,000 of these explicitly reserved for the <Col N="228" /> long-term unemployed, very long-term unemployed and socially excluded, and with long-term unemployed benefiting from many of the remainder.</P>

            <entry>Revision of thresholds for small and medium size companies</entry>
            <entry>This directive provides for an increase in the threshold limits which determine small and medium sized company status in Company Law. The directive is completely optional. Implementation was examined in 1996. At the time it was decided not to implement the Directive due to the preparation of a Draft Financial Reporting Standard for smaller entities (FRSSE) by the Consultative Committee of Accounting Bodies, which was designed to relieve small companies of some of the burdens of financial reporting. This Financial Reporting Standard was adopted at the end of 1997. Ireland is free to implement the Directive at any stage and it is likely that there will be another review by the EU of the threshold limits in advance of the introduction of the Euro. The matter can be examined further at that stage.</entry>

      <P>I am aware of the plans of FÁS in relation to the overseas graduate placement programme. The position is that the placements under the programme are being temporarily suspended in light of the skills shortages which are present in the economy. I believe that this strategy is the correct one in the current circumstances. However, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that FÁS is continuing to interact with those graduates currently abroad on placements. In addition, it has put measures in place to attract former participants of the programme who have remained overseas back to <Col N="234" /> Ireland as part of an overall strategy to address skills shortages. It is intended to review the programme in the middle of this year with a view to recommencing placements as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the level of job losses recorded in 1998, referred to by the Deputy. This data was mentioned in the recently published Forfás 1998 Review and 1999 Outlook statement. While the level of job loss recorded by Forfás's annual employment survey has been the highest since 1992 it must be seen in the context of overall strong economic growth, <Col N="235" /> declining unemployment and sustained employment expansion throughout the economy.</P>
      <P>Employment is dependent on the success or failure of individual firms in the market economy and it is inevitable that some firms will fail as, indeed, many thrive and generate additional employment. The job losses mentioned by the Deputy must be looked at in the context of 1998 job gains where total permanent employment in IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland assisted clients rose by almost 13,000, to 250,000, its highest ever level. Furthermore job gains in permanent full-time employment amounted to over 28,000 in 1998, of which just over 24,000 were new first time jobs, the highest level achieved over the past ten years. Irish owned companies accounted for just  under 12,000 of the total job gains, the second highest level on record.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the considerable success in employment growth, the increase in job losses reflects the impact of unfavourable international market conditions on Irish-owned firms and, particularly, on some overseas companies. It highlights the need for continued focus on actions by firms at operating level, and by Government at policy level, to improve and sustain competitiveness. I can assure the Deputy that this focus will not be lacking under this Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The securing of a replacement industry for any area of the country is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one in which I have any direct function.</P>
      <P>However, with regard to Betatherm Ireland Limited, on the closure of the company in November 1998, I decided that an Inter-Agency Task Force should be established to formulate an adequate response to the closure.</P>
      <P>The task force, which had its first meeting on 18 January 1999 in Castlebar, is chaired by Mr. Des Mahon, County Manager, Mayo County Council. The task force comprises representatives from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, the Local Employment Service and the County Enterprise Board. I have asked Mr. Mahon to keep me informed of developments on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the announcement on 30 Nov<Col N="236" /> ember 1998 regarding McHale Engineering's new project for Ballinrobe will greatly benefit the local economy and reduce the impact of the Betatherm closure. Based in Kilmaine, Claremorris, McHale Engineering Ltd. is a family owned company specialising in the manufacture of silage bale wrapping equipment. The company, with support from Enterprise Ireland, is embarking on an expansion which will involve the construction and equipment of a new factory of 50,000 sq. ft. and the creation of 60 additional jobs in Ballinrobe.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland, for its part, will actively market the 20,000 sq. ft. former Betatherm factory to potential overseas investors.</P>
    <P>In relation to The All Fresh Bakery, I understand that a receiver has been appointed and is having ongoing discussions with a number of parties for its sale as a going concern.</P>
    <P>Generally in County Mayo, since I established the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative on 10 July 1997, I have announced many new jobs for the region, including the following: Carrokeel Seafoods, Killala, 85 jobs; Lionbridge Technologies, Ballina, 100 jobs; Coca Cola, Ballina, 150 jobs; Volex, Castlebar, 200 jobs; Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Westport, 170 jobs.</P>
    <P>These projects are making a significant direct contribution to the region's economy as well as creating additional spin-off employment arising from sub-supply opportunities. The Coca-Cola project alone will create over 1,000 jobs during its construction phase.</P>
    <P>In response to a recommendation of the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative, I also announced that FÁS is to support the establishment of an Auto-Turning Training Centre in Ballina in conjunction with industry. The location of the centre in Ballina is a major boost for the long-term job creating prospects of the region.</P>

      <P>The INTERREG Maritime Initiative under which the project mentioned has been approved for funding is a joint Ireland/Wales one under the European Union's Initiative for the development of cross-Border regions throughout the European Union. The lead Departments for this particular programme are our Department of Finance and the Welsh Office. Most of the funding involved comes from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) with an element of European Social Fund (ESF) involved in its Subprogram 2 which deals with Human Resources Development. My Department has responsibility for the draw-down of the ESF element on the Irish side, while the United Kingdom's Department for Education and Employment has a similar role in respect of the ESF component of the programme on the Welsh side.</P>
      <P>Delays have been experienced in drawing down funds under this programme. The EU procedures for the drawdown of ESF funds for cross-Border initiatives require that both sets of national authorities apply separately for funding advances to the European Commission. Both applications are processed jointly by the Commission and any problem that may arise in either application has the effect of automatically delaying action on both. To eliminate the difficulties that had arisen, my Department received the approval of the joint Irish/Welsh Monitoring Committee to present a revised financial plan to the Commission. The European Commission has recently accepted the new financial plan and in line with EU procedures my Department immediately applied for funds. It is expected that these will arrive in my Department in the next two months.</P>
      <P>Since my Department is quite aware of the impact of the delays here on the Irish project promoters it had attempted to find an interim solution in this case without success. In the circumstances I can only assure the Deputy that every effort is continuing to get the allocated funds to the projects on the earliest date possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 to 178, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Regional Fisheries Board has advised that illegal fishing continues to be a significant problem in the lower Nore Estuary and <Col N="239" /> has confirmed to me its ongoing commitment to tackling illegal fishing throughout the southern region.</P>
    <P>The Southern Regional Fisheries Board will receive increased funding in 1999 giving it a budget of over £1 million. This will directly assist continued enhancement of the board's fisheries protection programmes which have accounted latterly for over half of the board's activity and expenditure. In 1998, board staff carried out over 680 vehicle and boat patrols in the Barrow and Nore (Waterford) area as well as increasing stakeouts on the ground, an increase of 57 per cent in protection activity over 1997. This level of effort and dedication by the protection staff of the board is paying dividends. Over 100 illegal nets were seized last year and 16 prosecutions are pending.</P>
    <P>While poaching remains a serious problem in the southern region, I am satisfied that the commitment and dedication of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board staff backed up by increased funding will continue to show results in the campaign to eliminate illegal fishing in the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation to which the Deputy refers is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, an independent statutory body to which any questions regarding progress should be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no statutory responsibility for, nor authority over, this tailings facility. This type of facility would have been subject to local authority planning control. I am, of course, concerned that old mine-related sites such as this do not cause environmental or health problems. Officials of my Department have, notwithstanding the fact that I have no statutory responsibility or authority for this site, visited the site and discussed recent developments with the planning authority. <Col N="243" /> The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating the situation and my Department is co-operating fully with the agency. I understand that the agency has also been monitoring water quality in the area for some time.</P>
    <P>The mine which generated the tailings operated under a State mining lease for the extraction of State minerals. This lease ran from 1 September 1965 to 1 December 1998. Production of the minerals ceased in 1982 and the area of the tailings pond was subsequently grassed to stabilise the top surface and prevent dust blows. Tailings are the sand-like residue of ground rock after removal of target ores from the mined rock. The tailings pond is not within the lease area. I understand that the tailings area was recently sold to a farmer.</P>
    <P>I would also add that the lease for this mine was drafted over 30 years ago at a time when the problems which might be associated with tailings management facilities and environmental concerns were not as widely appreciated as they are today. Accordingly leases at that time did not contain conditions relating to maintenace of tailings facilities.</P>
    <P>Modern leases and licences under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, have very stringent requirements regarding closure. Planning and design of tailings impoundments and substantial bonds are required of the lessee or licensee to ensure that funds are available in perpetuity to allow that the necessary maintenance and rehabilitation are carried out. A properly managed facility would not pose a hazard to public health or the environment. Construction and maintenance of a tailings facility is now a licensable activity under the Environmental Protection Agency Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 to 193, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>During the assessment of the loughs Corrib, Mask and Cara (Western Lakes) proposal for European Regional Development Fund grant aid in 1994-5 the revenue generated by visiting anglers was estimated at just under £10 million per annum. It was also estimated that just over 28,000 visiting anglers are attracted annually to the loughs and that subject to a comprehensive development programme for the fisheries and an effective marketing strategy, the potential exists to double the number of game angling visitor numbers from 22,500 to 45,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Lakes project has been receiving ongoing funding under the Tourism Angling Measure (TAM) since early 1995 with the important objective of rehabilitating the Corrib, Mask and Cara lakes as prime brown trout fisheries for domestic and tourism angling. The amount <Col N="245" /> of funds allocated for each of the years of the project is: £1.035 million in 1995, £0.220 million in 1997 and £0.800 million in 1998. This brings the total investment in the Western Lakes project to over £2 million and is nearly 12 per cent of the total funding available over the whole period under the Tourism Angling Measure. The £800,000 provided in 1998 is over 30 per cent of the funding approved in that year. The works undertaken to date include predator control stock management, water quality and instream survey work.</P>
    <P>The objective of the TAM is to develop the national angling product to best international standards and significantly increase the number of tourist anglers visiting the country. Angling has tremendous benefits from the tourism perspective as a year round activity often in non-traditional tourism locations, delivering significant local economic return as well as contributing to the tourism sector overall. The main flagship investments under this measure have been in the west.</P>
    <P>I understand that an application for an additional £4 million in funding, based on the surveys of rivers and streams carried out by the Central Fisheries Board on the Corrib, Mask and Cara has been submitted to the TAM Unit in the Central Fisheries Board. I understand, however, that all TAM funding has already been allocated and any additional applications will have to be considered as fall-back options and in the context of their relative value and priority.</P>
    <P>The request by Game Angling Ireland West to meet a deputation to discuss funding was received by my office only yesterday and I have not yet had an opportunity to meet with them.</P>

      <P>The participants in the peace process recognised in the British-Irish Agreement the value of the work being done by organisations, such as the Glencree Centre for Reconciliation, to develop reconciliation and mutural understanding and respect between and within communities and traditions, in Northern Ireland and on the island.</P>
      <P>The Department's Peace and Reconciliation Fund was established in 1982 to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work and in developing a better understanding between people in both parts of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain. Since its establishment, it has funded a variety of organisations which are working in the field of reconciliation, primarily between North and South.</P>
      <P>The Glencree Centre for Reconciliation has consistently been one of the largest beneficiaries from the fund, in the years 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 the allocations to Glencree were £95,000, £50,000 and £60,000, respectively. The £95,000 awarded by the Department in 1995 was a once-off capital grant to help with its building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, last year the Department of the Taoiseach contributed £10,000 to Glencree from <Col N="247" /> the Government's 1798 Commemoration Programme.</P>
    <P>I am very familiar with, and supportive of, the excellent work undertaken at Glencree and I would expect to be a position to provide them with funding this year.</P>
    <P>My officials maintain regular contact with Glencree and have recently invited them to outline their views on its future role. These views, when received, will be given the most careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I have noted with great concern the recent reports of communal violence in the Indian state of Gujarat in the course of which serveral Christian churches and other property has been destroyed by groups of Hindus. It is understood that the attacks have taken place in the Dangs district of Gujarat which is inhabited mainly by tribal people. Tribal groups are among the most marginalised communities in India and live outside of mainstream Hindu society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has been the subject of consultations within the EU. It has now been agreed that the Presidency, through its Ambassador in New Delhi, should convey the concern of EU member states on the issue to the Indian authorities. It is hoped that the latter will take the <Col N="248" /> appropriate action necessary to prevent further violence and uphold the traditionally secular nature of Indian society.</P>

      <P>Sixty States must ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted at Rome in July 1997, before it can come into effect. Over 70 countries, including Ireland, have already signed the Rome statute. As the Deputy points out in his question, the Statue includes a provision which states that official capacity and immunities shall not be a bar to the exercise of the court's jurisdiction. I agree that this is an important and welcome provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to ratification, it must be borne in mind that the Rome statute is a long and complex document which includes 13 parts and 128 articles in respect of which no reservation is permitted. As a first step, these will require careful and detailed consideration in order to determine the nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for the State to be in a position to meet its obli<Col N="249" /> gations under the statute. The State may proceed to ratify the statute only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position at this point to say how long this process might take, but I can assure the Deputy that it will be given a high priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 201, 203, 204 and 205 together.</P>
      <P>The massacre of 45 Kosovar Albanians at Racak on 15 January has been universally condemned for its barbarity and senselessness. In addition to the tragic loss of life, it has seriously raised tensions in Kosovo and further undermined the efforts of those who are trying to bring about a peaceful solution. In addition, the subsequent actions of the authorities in Belgrade, in declaring the Head of the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM), Ambassador Walker, <i>persona non grata</i> and their order to expel him, as well as their refusal to grant entry to the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal in order to investigate the massacre have compounded the gravity of the situation and posed a serious challenge to the will of the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international community has reacted speedily. The United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the massacre and called for a reversal of the decisions taken by Belgrade in relation to the expulsion order against the Head of the KVM and the refusal to grant entry to the Chief Prosecutor of the Tribunal. Similarly within the EU there were also immediate consultations, as a result of which the German Presi<Col N="250" /> dency conveyed to the authorities in Belgrade our united response of shock and outrage at the Racak massacre. The Presidency further made clear our insistence that Belgrade co-operate fully with the KVM, including by withdrawing the expulsion order against Ambassador Walker, and with the International Tribunal, by allowing the Chief Prosecutor to carry out in Kosovo the necessary investigations.</P>
    <P>The way forward for a peaceful solution in Kosovo has been clearly spelled out in several resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. Compliance by both sides with the terms and demands of these resolutions would provide a real cease-fire and an environment in which political negotiations leading to autonomy for Kosovo could take place. It would also be possible to start reconstruction and avoid the fear of new movements of refugees and displaced persons. The Security Council has also endorsed the work of the KVM and the right of the International Tribunal to investigate atrocities within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Secretary General of the United Nations has a special role in reporting on the status of compliance with these resolutions.</P>
    <P>I therefore availed of the visit to Ireland last week of the United Nations Secretary General to discuss the most recent events in Kosovo and to assure him of our support in his own efforts. While in Dublin the Secretary General was endeavouring to persuade Belgrade to reverse their two decisions of the KVM and the International Tribunal. I urged upon him the need to ensure the safety of the personnal with KVM.</P>
    <P>The latest position is that Belgrade has frozen rather than rescinded its decision in respect of Ambassador Walker, but has made no change in respect of its refusing entry to the Chief Prosecutor of the International Tribunal. This in my view is not acceptable and international pressure must be maintained on Belgrade until there is a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>I discussed these issues most recently with my EU colleagues at the General Affairs Council on Monday. I reiterated my outrage at the Racak massacre. I further called for the admission of the Chief Prosecutor as a matter of urgency. I also stressed the need for mutually reinforcing actions by the various international fora in addressing the situation in Kosovo. Ultimately any lasting solution for Kosovo must be found through negotiation. Therefore I stressed my support for the negotiating process on the basis of the proposals put forward by the international mediators, Ambassadors Hill and Petritsch, which have been endorsed by the EU and the Contact Group of six countries. If negotiations are to start, it will be necessary for the Kosovar Albanian side to display responsibility and to form a broad based and truly representative team. This is something which they have not been able to do up to the present. I hope that they will now be able to find this sense of purpose and responsibility.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain pressure as necessary on <Col N="251" /> the sides, we also decided to step up work on the strengthening of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the one hand, as well as to play our part in stopping the flow of money and weapons to Kosovo armed groups, on the other.</P>
    <P>Ireland, through its participation in the Verification Mission, will continue to contribute to the international efforts on the ground in Kosovo. We shall also continue to participate actively in deliberations at international fora of which we are members, notably the EU and the OSCE.</P>
    <P>The massacre at Racak is a sad and tragic indication of how the already bad situation in Kosovo can rapidly deteriorate. But it also focuses attention on the urgency of action. I would hope that out of the tragedy of Racak, the parties to the conflict, aided and supported by the international community, will now find a new sense of purpose to work peacefully towards a solution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202, 207 and 208 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council which are designated for the Western Europe and Others Group of States for the two-year term 2001-2002. The election will take place in the 185-member UN General Assembly in the autumn of 2000, probably in October. The election is being contested by two other candidates, Norway and Turkey. Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of those States present and voting. In effect, this means that the support of around 120 States will be needed to secure election. The election is by secret ballot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the electorate consists of governments it is the administrations of other countries which are the object of Ireland's lobbying effort. At the <Col N="252" /> same time, the Government will be mindful of the possibility of raising the matter through any of a variety of channels where it is of the considered view that that would be of benefit.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have sought support for Ireland's candidacy on all appropriate occasions, including on official visits abroad. Since September last, I have personally discussed Ireland's candidacy with representatives of over forty United Nations member states.</P>
    <P>All other members of the Government, including most particularly the Taoiseach, are alert to utilizing and will continue to utilize every appropriate opportunity to raise the matter of Ireland's candidacy with other Governments.</P>

      <P>Funding of £143,848 in 1997 and £131,000 in 1998 was provided to Trócaire towards activities undertaken under the CIDSE (International Cooperation for Solidarity and Development) Programme in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Under this programme, Trócaire works together with a number of other international NGOs. Activities in Vietnam included agricultural training, health and credit and savings projects. In 1998 £11,528 was provided to Oxfam for a training site for the Ha Tinh blind association in Ha Tinh Province.</P>
      <P>Through funds provided by Irish Aid, consultancy projects have been undertaken by Irish consultants in 1996 and 1997, in the agricultural and power sectors in Vietnam, under the Irish General Consultant Trust Fund (CTF) at the World Bank.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 212, 216 and 228 together.</P>
      <P>The subjects for the annual programme of special and commemorative stamps are selected by the Philatelic Advisory committee of An Post after very wide consultation, and are then approved by the board of the company and by the Government. In order to allow sufficient time for design, printing and publicity, each annual stamp programme should be finalised well before the year of issue.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Centenary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was one of many worthy suggestions put forward for inclusion in the 1999 programme, but which was not selected by the committee. However, in view of the fact that a significant number of representations have been made to me by Members of the Oireachtas expressing the wish to have the centenary year of the association marked by the issue of a special stamp, and having regard to the association's extensive membership throughout the country, I have asked An Post to re-consider their decision in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, is the legislative basis for the licensing of scheduled bus services in this country. This legislation governs the provision of passenger services, other than those provided by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering an application for a licence under the Act, my Department is required to have regard to whether the proposed service is &ldquo;required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of <Col N="258" /> passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the proposed service&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In 1997, my Department received a licence application from a bus operator to transport school children from the Knocklyon area of Dublin to schools in the locality. This application was refused in view of the level of services already provided by Dublin Bus in the area. The operator has since made further submissions to my Department and these are currently under consideration.</P>

On the Trans-Atlantic route, both Aer Lingus and Continental began daily flights to Newark. Royal Jordanian have just started a Chicago service. Aer Lingus will start up a service to Los Angeles in March. Delta, American Transair and Royal Jordanian will begin flights to JFK later in 1999.</P>
      <P>Services to the UK increased significantly in 1998. Airlines began flights to Birmingham and Stansted, while Virgin Express started a further service to Stansted in December. Aer Lingus began services to the European mainland in April 1998 with triangular flights serving Shannon / Paris / Dublin and Shannon / Dublin / Frankfurt. Next March, Aer Lingus plan a daily direct flight to Paris. These very positive developments in services from Shannon have resulted in an overall increase in terminal passenger traffic of 7 per cent in 1998, notwithstanding the decline in transit passenger numbers which is related to the reduction in Aeroflot services through Shannon. It is clear from the foregoing that the overall growth in the range and frequency of services augurs well for the future of Shannon Airport and will ensure a continued positive contribution to the tourist industry in the west.</P>

      <P>The precise structure of the offer to <Col N="259" /> the public of shares in Telecom Éireann, which is being planned for around mid year, depending on market conditions, will not be determined until closer to the flotation date. The shares will be targeted at retail investors in Ireland and to institutional investors both in Ireland and abroad. It is envisaged that there will be a registration period for retail investors in advance of the actual offer period, when full details of the structure, process of application and the company will be made widely available. A significant retail tranche is in line with the overall objectives for the IPO, which are to maximise return to the Exchequer and to ensure that IPO should be successful, wider share ownership and value for money on expenditure related to sale.</P>
      <P>The question of offering incentives to potential retail investors, whether they are Telecom Éireann customers or not, is under consideration but a final decision will not be made until closer to the time.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises fully the importance of this IPO project in the context of the precedent it may set for future changes in ownership of other State companies.</P>

      <P>I met with representatives of the Transport Users Support Group in November 1997 to discuss their alternative transport plan for Dublin. I stressed that the strategy recommended in the DTI final report provided the general policy framework for the development of the transports system in the Greater Dublin Area and that the Government was committed to its implementation. That strategy did not include either an M50 circle rail route or an underground rail link between Heuston Station and the city centre.</P>
      <P>The DTI strategy is at present being updated and it is open to interested parties to make submissions to the Dublin Transportation Office in relation to the content of the updated strategy for the period 2000 to 2016.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Vienna EMF Resolution which was issued following a symposium on mobile phones and health in October 1998 and which claims that the biological effects from low intensity exposures are scientifically established. I am also aware that this claim of the resolution has proved to be controversial among the scientific community, as the bulk of research on the issue of non-ionising radiation has not shown any such link.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport issued a report on Non-Ionising Microwave Radiation Emissions from Communications Masts in December, 1998. The Joint Committee concluded that the evidence available at present does not indicate an unacceptable health hazard from microwave emissions within the IRPA (International Radiation Protection Association) guidelines&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The IRPA guidelines are applied in Ireland through the licences held by mobile telephony and MMDS operators. It is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to ensure compliance with these requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do agree with the Vienna EMF Resolution's proposal that further research be carried out in this area, and my Department will be monitoring <Col N="265" /> international developments and, as necessary, participating in the comprehensive programs of research being undertake to ensure that the most up-to-date standards are applied to emissions in this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's point about indemnification, as I have stated before, the Joint Committee recommended that the licensed operators should examine the issue of indemnification with a view to providing same as soon as possible and where possible.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the Joint Committee that the issue of insurance indemnification is one for the operators themselves to consider and, as such, I have no function in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 226 and 229 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the EU is part funding the purchase by Bus Átha Cliath of 50 double decker buses and that the balance of the funding for these 50 and for the purchase of a further 100 buses is being provided by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It is and always has been my policy that transport operators, and in particular the State transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within the overall resources available to them. I am committed to bringing about a situation where public transport facilities are fully accessible to all at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Regarding the additional 150 double decker buses, these are required urgently to meet the traffic congestion problems in Dublin as part of the Government's commitment to implementation of the Dublin Transportation  Office short-term action plan. They are of key importance in providing adequate services on the quality bus corridors which are now being developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When orders were being placed last year for the additional buses, low floor double decker buses were only beginning to come into operation in the UK. In the circumstances Bus Átha Cliath did not have a sufficient degree of experience <Col N="267" /> with the new designs to justify the placing of such a large order for the purchase of low floor double deck buses.</P>
    <P>However, progress is being made. Models which may be suitable have increasingly been brought into service in the UK in the past few months. Earlier this week I discussed the issue of low floor accessible busses with Glenda Jackson MP, Transport Minister at the UK Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and took the opportunity to see one of the London low floor double decker buses myself. I also discussed the matter with the head of unit for disabled passengers in London Transport and met the driver of the bus who outlined the features in detail. I understand that some modifications are to be carried out and I made the point that the experience with actual operation in London will be beneficial when Bus Átha Cliath are undertaking their evaluations.</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath are currently arranging to obtain vehicles from DAF, who are supplying the London buses, and from Volvo and Dennis, with the objective of conducting six month pilot trials. Details of the testing programme are being developed by Bus Átha Cliath. My Department has already discussed the pilot testing proposals with the EU Commission who share our commitment to accelerating the improvment in accessibility to public transport.</P>
    <P>The first of the vehicles for these trials should arrive in a couple of months and, depending on the results of the pilot tests, Bus Átha Cliath should be in a position to begin ordering accessible double-decker buses from 2000.</P>
    <P>In addition to the progress being made with low floor double deck buses there have been other developments in this area. For example, Bus Átha Cliath has six low floor single decker buses now in operation on route No. 3 (Belfield to Drumcondra). My Department provided significant funding towards the cost of these buses. The company has also recently announced that it plans to purchase a further 20 fully accessible 33 seater midi buses as part of its 1999 fleet replacement programme.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann has a further ten low-floor vehicles on order. These vehicles are due for delivery in 1999 and will be put into service on Bus Éireann's Cork and Limerick city routes.</P>
    <P>Each of the companies, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, have now established user groups representative of people with disabilities.

    <P>In relation to the difference in costing, I am informed by the CIE companies that the average cost of a low-floor bus is approximately 15 per cent greater than the cost of a high floor equivalent.</P>
    <P>However, I want to stress that I am committed to having public transport facilities fully access<Col N="268" /> ible to all at the earliest possible date. At a recent meeting with Bus Átha Cliath I was informed that from now on they expect to be replacing their fleet with low floor double deck buses.</P>

      <P>As the Minister with responsibility for public transport, I have made a strong case to both the Government and the EU for additional funding for public transport and I have been successful in this regard. Arising from the decision to reallocate the EU aid for the Luas project, additional bus and rail investment totalling £97.5 million was approved. For the first time EU aid was provided as part of the Luas package for the purchase of additional buses by Dublin Bus. Exchequer co-financing was also provided for the first time for EU assisted bus and rail projects. The 1999 Estimates provide Exchequer funding for the purchase by Dublin Bus of a further 100 buses.</P>

The allocation of the subvention among the operating subsidiaries is currently a matter for CIE but these arrangement will change with the establishment of public service contracts under which the State will puchase specific public transport services.</P>

      <P>Two visits outside the State were undertaken in connection with the ongoing study of the reserve.

The delegation also visited reserve units in training where they were afforded full access to the reservists. In September, 1998 the same delegation undertook a five-day visit to Sweden, Finland and Denmark for further briefings. I am advised by the military authorities that in each of these countries the briefings were conducted by senior full-time military personnel and that in Sweden, reservists contributed to the briefing received there. I am also advised that in Denmark, reserve units were visited in training where the delegation was again afforded full access to the reservists.

    <P>*The recommendations contained in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan in relation to the recorganisation of the army took effect from 1 November, 1998. This means that the army is now organised as follows: 3 brigades; defence forces training centre, and 2 logistics bases.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking the areas of the three brigades correspond to the areas of the former Eastern, Southern and Western Commands with the exception that the area of the former Curragh Command now forms part of the areas of the Eastern, Southern and Western Brigades. The area of the Defence Forces Training Centre corresponds to the area of the Curragh Camp and the Glen of Imaal.</P>
    <P>However, the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan also provides for a special study of the Reserve Forces to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November, 1997 I announced the setting up of a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process the Chief of Staff established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. The joint civilian-military steering group, as part of its work, oversees and guides the military board in its task.</P>
    <P>Pending the findings and recommendations of the study the FCA and An Slua Muirí are still organised in old command structure.</P>

      <P>Provision is made in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan (1996-1998) &ndash; which was approved  by Government in March, 1996 &ndash; for a special study of the Reserve Forces to be undertaken during the lifetime of the plan. Accordingly, in November, 1997 I announced ths setting up of a joint civilian-military steering group to carry out this examination. As part of the examination process the Chief of Staff had already established a military board to conduct a study of the reserve. The joint civilian-military steering group, as part of its work, oversees and guides the military board in its task.</P>
      <P>From the onset there has been ongoing liaison and exchange of views between the steering group and the military board. The military board submitted an interim report early last year and subsequently the steering group submitted an interim report to me on 30 July, 1998.</P>
      <P>In December, 1998 the military board forwarded an initial, incomplete draft of its final report to the steering group for consideration. The steering group is at present examining this draft. On completion of its examination of the draft report the steering group will convey its views and recommendations to the military board which will, in due course, submit its final report. On conclusion of its deliberations the steering group will submit a final report to me.</P>
      <P>In October, 1997 the Chief of Staff established a military board to conduct a study of the Reserve Defence Force as recommended in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan. Subsequently, I set up a joint civilian-military steering group to oversee and guide the military board study to the Chief of Staff at the end of January, 1998 and subsequently forwarded a copy of that report to the steering group and sent copies to the Chief of Staff and to the President of the military board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 to 248, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Since 1988 when computerisation effectively began in the Naval Service, about £3.2 million has been paid to contractors in relation to the development of the computerised fishery protection information system, its related systems, and the future enhancement of those systems to meet new EU reporting requirements. The main contractors in chronological order were:&ndash; Hewlett-Packard Ireland Ltd., Benchmark Ltd., Dell Computer Corporation, Digital Equipment Irl. Ltd., Unisoft Systemas Informaticos, Peregrine Systems Ltd. and Ernst &amp; Young.</P>
      <P>The systems support the deployment of patrol vessels towards the areas of greatest fishing activity and support the intelligence-based boarding and checking of fishing vessels. A comparison of the figures for the detection of infringements before and after computerisation, shows that there has been a four-fold increase since computerisation.</P>
      <P>There is a legal requirement on Ireland to have these systems and their role in fishery protection is essential. In recognition of this, the EU has allowed Ireland about 50 per cent recoupment of the money spent to date. Very substantial assistance will be provided in relation to the enhancement of these systems to meet new EU requirements.</P>
      <P>As regards the technical stores, I am advised that the current Inventory Management System went live in 1993. Since then, the coding system was changed once and there has been no increase in the staff establishment. I am advised that the system has been adequate but that there are technical difficulties preventing ships being able to fully update the system while at sea. These difficulties will be addressed as soon as possible, but Year 2000 compliance work must take precedence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Naval Service has been involved in a pilot project to evaluate the suitability of new maintenance management software for the Defence Forces as a whole. Software costs total about £260,000. No final decision has been made in relation to that software but other options are also being considered. In this connection, a contract, at a cost of about STG£38,000 has been placed for the supply of a standard merchant marine maintenance management system for the new <Col N="277" /> patrol vessel which is now being built. One option could be to replicate that system on all ships.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the investment, if any, made in the air ambulance service provided by the Air Corps; and the plans, if any, for future investment in this regard.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1965 an arrangement has been in place whereby the Air Corps provides air ambulance transport to health boards for emergency cases, utilising available aircraft. This service is generally provided in emergencies requiring the removal of badly injured or very ill persons over long distances, particularly where they cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance. The service is also provided for the removal from the islands of persons requiring urgent hospital attention when weather conditions are such as to make boat transport impossible or hazardous to the patient.</P>
      <P>Following the Government's consideration of the Price Waterhouse Review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service, a planning process is now in place to give effect to the Government's decision in the matter. In this regard the military authorities have been asked to prepare an implementation plan to give effect to the recommendations contained in the review. The question of any future investment in the air ambulance service will be addressed as part of this process.</P>

The <Col N="278" /> leaders of the Rising are buried at Arbour Hill. In addition a plaque containing the names of those known to have died at that time, as well as the names of Thomas Kent and Roger Casement who died later in that year, was unveiled there in April 1966 by the then President of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The importation of meat products from member states and third countries is governed by EU harmonised rules. The main conditions for imports include: advance notification to my Department of each consignment; the goods must be accompanied by veterinary certification or, in certain cases, a commercial document; the goods must come from an establishment, e.g. slaughterhouse, cutting plant or coldstore which has been approved by the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>Following the European Commission Decision of 27 March 1996 (96/239/EEC), the importation of cattle and products of bovine origin from the UK was banned from 28 March 1996. Since the introduction of the prohibition, close liaison has been maintained between my Department, the Garda authorities and Customs and Excise to ensure that the ban is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as growth promoters are concerned, there is common EU legislation in relation to the general prohibition on use and on the controls to be effected in each member state at farm and slaughter plant level to detect any infringements. Such controls are subject to regular EU audit. Ireland implements fully its obligations in this regard. As regards imports from third countries, under EU legislation, such trade may only originate in countries where the European Commission is satisfied that the regulatory system in the country concerned offers guarantees equivalent to those  under the EU legislation. third <Col N="282" /> countries, which are authorised under this system to export meat to the EU, are subject to on the spot inspections by the EU Commission to ensure the effectiveness of their controls.</P>
    <P>In addition, imports of meat to Ireland from third countries are subject to monitoring for the presence of certain substances which it is technically possible to detect in meat. However, since analytical methods for growth promoters, as such, can most effectively detect such residues in bodily fluids and organs, as distinct from meat, such checks on imported product would not necessarily provide any additional effective safeguard to consumers.</P>

      <P>In circumstances where the lessor is not a participant in the REP scheme, lands owned by the lessor, other than lands leased to the REP scheme participant, are not relevant to the scheme. However, the conditions of the scheme provide that the creation of farming units for the purpose of claiming or increasing payments under the scheme is prohibited. Therefore, where, prior to the submission of an application for the REP scheme, an applicant has leased land to a participant in the scheme the situation in relation to that land would have to be assessed as part of the approval process.</P>

      <P>The exportation of greyhounds from Ireland to Spain is a legitimate trade within the European Union. We are precluded by EU rules of competition from taking any steps to restrict the export of greyhounds to other member states. The treatment of greyhounds in Spain is a matter for the Spanish authorities.</P>
      <P>In 1991 Bord na gCon ceased to be involved in the sale of greyhounds to Spain. In 1995 the World Greyhound Racing Federation, WGRF, of which Bord na gCon is a member, carried out an extensive study of and prepared a report on the situation at Spanish greyhound tracks and their associated kennels. The report prepared by two veterinary surgeons was subsequently presented to the WGRF, of which Spain is also a member, and it contained a wide number of recommendations to improve the care, nutrition and general husbandry of the racing greyhound in Spain.</P>
      <P>The protection during transportation of animals, including greyhounds, is governed by the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Orders, 1995 and 1997, which give effect to Council Directive 91/628/EEC as amended. These orders make provision for the welfare of animals during transport by road, rail, sea or air and require that the persons entrusted with the transport of animals possess the necessary knowledge to care for them. I am satisfied that the provisions of this legislation safeguard the welfare of all species of animals leaving this country.</P>

      <P>The person named was paid his full entitlement of £1,178 under the 1998 cattle headage scheme on 21 January 1998. The person named submitted one ten month special beef premium application in respect of 23 animals and one 22 month special beef premium application in respect of one animal on 15 May 1998. Due to a problem with the applicant's area aid details, payment did not issue because the stocking density had been exceeded. The matter has now been resolved and manual payments of £1,658.99 in respect of the ten month application and £72.13 in respect of the 22 month application are currently being prepared.</P>

The three cows were listed as beef cows on the application form, but at an inspection carried out on 23 July 1998 two of the cows were deemed to be Friesian cows which do not qualify under the cattle headage scheme for the high rate of grant and are ineligible under the suckler cow scheme. The person named was informed by my Department that he would not receive payment under either scheme for 1998. He has sought a review of this decision and his appeal is currently being considered. He will be notified of the result of the review as soon as it is completed.</P>

      <P>I have taken a number of important initiatives to deal with the current difficulties in the pigmeat sector. On four occasions last year I secured increased export refunds from the EU Commission, the most recent being in November. These increases have been of considerable help to exporters.</P>
      <P>In September I succeeded in gaining agreement from the Commission for the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme, under which EU funding is provided for the storage of pigmeat for a maximum period of six months. The scheme is still running and to date about 177,000 tonnes of pigmeat have been temporarily removed from the market throughout the Community. Ireland has over 800 tonnes of pigmeat in storage under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> The EU food aid package for Russia will include 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat bought on the EU market. This will have a positive effect given the current oversupply.</P>
    <P>At a Council meeting held last week, I along with many of my ministerial colleagues in the other member states successfully requested the EU Commission to hold a special working group as soon as possible to discuss positive actions to address the current weakness in the market. This meeting will take place on 10 February.</P>
    <P>The matters related to VAT for pig farmers are within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>

As the applicant did not submit a 1998 area aid application form he is only entitled to payment on a maximum of 15 livestock units. However, his milk quota of 13,099 gallons accounts for 14.603 livestock units, leaving only 0.397 livestock units available for payment in respect of special beef premium animals. Some 0.397 livestock units translates into 0.66 animals. Payment in respect of 0.66 animals issued on 15 December 1998.</P>

    <P>Since payments do not conclude at the end of the calendar year, it is not possible at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of the number or amounts yet to be paid. For example, under the suckler cow premium scheme and special beef premium scheme the EU regulations provide for advance payments in the year of application with balancing payments being made in the following year. Advance payments to applicants in respect of November and December 1998 applications under the special beef premium scheme cannot commence until the two month retention period expires, that is, in February and March respectively. Another consideration which must be taken into account when estimating expenditure is that Ireland has exceeded its national quota under the 1998 special beef premium scheme and it is not possible to determine the rate of balancing payments until all applications received under the 1998 ten month scheme are examined and processed. Further, payments to applicants under the October 1998 suckler cow premium scheme cannot commence until such time as the six month retention period expires in April 1999.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that not all applications received will ultimately qualify for payment. Some 1,066 applicants under the May 1998 suckler cow premium scheme do not hold suckler cow quota and are therefore not entitled to payment. Almost 1,800 cattle headage applicants and over 1,600 suckler cow applicants are not yet cleared for payment at local office level. Under the 1998 special beef premium scheme, over 5,800 January to October applications are under query. All of these farmers have been written to at least once. In other cases, payments have been withheld because of application of penalties or because there is a problem with the area aid application.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to have outstanding queries resolved with a view to having all eligible applicants paid their entitlements without delay. The EU deadline for making payment under the 1998 schemes is 30 June 1999.</P>

      <P>While no specific schemes of financial assistance for welfare purposes are operated by my Department, financial aid of an <i>ex gratia</i> nature has been paid to a number of animal welfare bodies each year-end since 1995. Last December I made grant-aid of £210,000 available to ten such bodies, including Meath Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which received a sum of £15,000.</P>
      <P>As the payment of such aid is invariably contingent on the resources, if any, which may be available at each year-end in the Department's Vote, I am not in a position to guarantee the continuation of such assistance.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 and 424 together.</P>
      <P>Financial assistance under the 1998 fodder scheme was made available to all sheep farmers with mountain grazings, suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers, with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons, in the worst affected areas. These areas are quite extensive and were identified as the worst affected in a Teagasc survey completed in September. The aim of the scheme was to give immediate help to farmers who were badly affected by the fodder crisis. The approach adopted was to give priority to the breeding herds having regard to the level of funding available for the scheme. However, arising from discussions at the Government meeting earlier this week, my Department and the Department of Finance have already entered into discussions to devise a suitable targeted scheme to assist farmers who are experiencing severe difficulty due to scarcity of fodder. The matter is being pursued with urgency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 357 and 358 together.</P>
      <P>Under EU legislation, the use of recombinant bovine somatotropin, rBST, in dairy cows is currently banned in all member states, except for the purposes of trials designed to provide scientific data on the substance, until 31 December 1999. When the ban was last extended, the Council also instructed the European Commission to entrust a working party of independent scientists with the task of assessing the effects of using rBST. As of now, the Commission has not come forward with the conclusions of such assessment, which, incidentally, was to pay particular attention to the incidence of mastitis, nor has it as yet made any specific proposals as to the position of rBST after the end of this year. It should also be mentioned that a recent judgment of the Court of First Instance of the European Court of Justice found against the European Commission regarding its decision not to implement a 1994 finding of the relevant scientific committee, which had found in favour of the safety of the produce in the context of EU pharmaceutical legislation.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the animal welfare-related reservations about the product which have been referred to by the Deputy. I shall take full account of such animal welfare concerns and the most up to date scientific views on the safety of the product, including from the group already referred to, in discussions at EU level on the question of the status of this substance after the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Scrapie was diagnosed in 22 flocks in 1998, most of which are known to have scrapie and which are participating in a number of research projects involving the veterinary research laboratory of my Department and the Veterinary College of University College, Dublin.</P>

    <P>The incidence of scrapie in Ireland would appear to be very low. A recent Department sur<Col N="312" /> veillance project conducted in nine slaughter plants, which involved testing of almost 8,000 samples from cull ewes, resulted in just one positive sample.</P>
    <P>The Veterinary Research Laboratory of the Department, in conjunction with the Veterinary College, is actively participating in a number of research projects involving scrapie. These projects are part of an EU wide research initiative which is examining various aspects of scrapie, including epidemiology, genetic resistance and strain typing.</P>
    <P>BSE has never been diagnosed in sheep in any country other than in experimentally infected sheep. Initial data on the strain types of scrapie present in Ireland suggests that we have only one strain of scrapie.</P>

      <P>Any initiative which would lead to the allocation of additional quota to milk producers in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland would have my full support. The matter has been discussed on a number of occasions between officials of my Department, the United Kingdom's Ministry for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The matter was also raised at ministerial level with the UK and I have also met the Cross-Border Milk Quota Action Group. However, as has been indicated previously, the success of an initiative of this nature will be dependent not only on the circumstances and timing of its presentation at EU level, but also, of <Col N="324" /> course on the position taken by the United Kingdom authorities.</P>

      <P>An application for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 1999 national reserve has been received from the person named.</P>
      <P>Some 4,000 farmers have applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from this reserve. These application forms are presently been recorded and it is not possible to say at this stage, what the outcome of any individual application will be. It is expected that all applicants will be informed, by the end of February, of the outcome of their applications.</P>
      <P>The person applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 1998 national reserve but the amount of quota available for distribution from that reserve was such that farmers with a low level of livestock units, i.e., under 5.8, received an allocation. The person named had 27 livestock units and there was, therefore, insufficient quota in the reserve to enable an allocation to be made to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment position with regard to County Mayo is that to date, over 89,000 payments totalling over £39.5 million have issued to County Mayo farmers under the various 1998 headage and premium schemes. Since payments do no conclude at the end of the calendar year, it is not possible at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of the amounts outstanding in any county. For example, under the suckler cow premium scheme and special beef premium scheme the EU regulations provide for advance payments in the year of application with balancing payments being made in the the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advance payments to applicants in respect of November and December 1998 applications under the special beef premium scheme cannot commence until the two month retention period expires, i.e. in February and March, respectively. Another consideration which must be taken into account when estimating expenditure is that Ireland has exceeded its national quota under the 1998 special beef premium scheme and it is not <Col N="333" /> possible to determine the rate of balancing payments until all applications received under the 1998 ten month scheme are examined and processed. Furthermore, payments to applicants under the October 1998 suckler cow premium scheme cannot commence until such time as the six month retention period expires in April 1999.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that not all applications received will ultimately qualify for payment. Over 100 applicants under the May 1998 suckler cow premium scheme in County Mayo do not hold suckler cow quota and are therefore not entitled to payment. More than 200 cattle headage applicants and almost 180 suckler cow applicants in County Mayo are not yet cleared for payment at local office level. Under the 1998 special beef premium scheme, almost 600 January to October applications from County Mayo are under query. All of these farmers have been written to at least once. In other cases, payments have been withheld because of application of penalties or because there is a problem with the area aid application.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to have outstanding queries resolved with a view to having all eligible applicants paid their entitlements without delay. The EU deadline for making payment under the 1998 schemes is 30 June 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>The position as regards lamb imports is that as a member of the European Union, Ireland is part of a free trade area in which it is not possible to legally prohibit, restrict or inhibit the trade of lambs from another member state. In general imported animals must be accompanied by  appropriate health certification, but under bilateral arrangements, lambs going to and from <Col N="336" /> Northern Ireland do not require such certification.</P>
      <P>All sheep presented for slaughter at export approved plants are subjected to supervision and control by the Department's staff. The veterinary inspectorate at these plants is aware of its responsibilities in this regard and of the legal requirements regarding the status of these animals. Department statistics, based on a comparison of supply and slaughter of lambs in 1998, would not support the view that significant imports of lambs from outside the island are taking place.</P>
      <P>I am aware that sheep farmers have protested outside certain meat plants on the issue of imported lambs.</P>

      <P>The availability of organophosphate sheep dips is primarily a matter for the Irish Medicines Board. For as long as such products are available I am, however, most anxious that they be used safely by the farming community. Under Regulation 31(6)(e) of the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996, retailers of animal remedies cannot possess, sell or supply an animal remedy which consists of or contains an OP substance unless and until a person has completed an appropriate training course approved by the Minister. Such a course was developed by the BASIS Company which was established in May, 1993 by the Animal and Plant Health Association and the Federation of Agrochemical Retail Merchants to promote good standards in relation to the storage and handling of pesticides and to issue guidelines on safety statements.</P>
      <P>The establishment of BASIS and the production of its guidelines were funded by the European Commission as part of the European Year of Safety, Hygiene and Health protection at Work. Given this background a BASIS Veterinary Committee was established to advise on the organisation of training courses for retailers of OP dips. The BASIS Committee has representatives of APHA &ndash; Animal and Plant Health Association &ndash; FARM &ndash; Federation of Agricultural Retailers and Merchants &ndash; ICOS &ndash; Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society &ndash; the Health and Safety Authority and my Department and is intended to be representative of all the interested parties. A training syllabus was drawn up and Teagasc has organised a series of courses held around the country. To date some 800 people have completed the course.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under Regulation 37 of the regulations, retailers must undergo special training in all aspects of retailing in animal remedies within three years of their coming into operation &ndash; August 1996. Five companies have been approved by the Department to give such courses. This course also incorporates training in the sale of OP sheep dips.</P>

      <P>The catering industry requires potatoes for chipping purposes to have particular characteristics which ensure a quality end product acceptable to consumers. Not all potatoes are suitable for producing potato chips of an acceptable quality. Caterers predominantly use potatoes of the variety Maris Piper and source their requirements through specialist suppliers of peeled potatoes and through potato merchants. There is no current widespread willingness among our producers to grow the variety Maris Piper and consequently the bulk of supplies &ndash; approximately 90 per cent &ndash; to the catering trade <Col N="342" /> for the production of potato chips has to be imported.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Freedom of Information Act was extended to health boards and the local authority sector as from 21 October 1998. Section 15 of the FOI Act requires the production by each public body subject to the Act of a reference book setting out the functions records and a general description of rules and practices of that body, generally known as section 15 FOI reference books. In addition section 16 of the Act required such bodies to publish extensive information in their rules, practices and procedures used for decision making etc., generally known as section 16 FOI manuals.</P>
      <P>I am advised that all health boards have produced their section 15 reference books. Similarly virtually all local authorities, including corporations and urban district councils have produced, or have had produced on their behalf, section 15 reference books. A sole exception arises in the case of an urban district council which proposes to publish a joint section 15 and 16 text next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that preparation and production of the section 16 manual is a particularly onerous undertaking. The position at this stage is that each health board has published its section 16 manual or a draft thereof. Virtually all local authority bodies have published their section 16 texts or had one produced on their <Col N="346" /> behalf. A few remaining small bodies in the local authority area are finalising their section 16 manuals and expect to publish within the next fortnight or so.</P>
    <P>Within the next few weeks therefore, I gather that all local authorities and health boards will have formally published these manuals. In the meantime it is open to members of the public to obtain access to the published, or where these are not finalised, to the draft manuals.</P>
    <P>On completion, section 15 publications are being made available at health board and local authority offices, local libraries and citizens advice centres. Because of their substantial volume some section 16 manuals are accessible at health board and local authority locations only.</P>

In addition, the progressive implementation of a comprehensive programme of expenditure reviews across Departments,  now being established under the Strategic Management Initiative, means that all spending programmes will become the subject of regular evaluation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 477, 478, 489, 490, 491 and 492 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for the past two years or so, the average length of official time taken to process an application for charitable tax exemption was of the order of six weeks. The processing time varies, depending on the extent to which an application is accompanied by all the information needed by Revenue and on whether all the conditions for granting exemptions are met when the initial application is made. The present processing time is an improvement on the years before 1997 which is attributable to the publication by Revenue in October 1996 of a comprehensive information booklet to assist applicants to make more complete applications. In the years prior to 1997, it took approximately eight to ten weeks on average to process an application.</P>
      <P>The remaining information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following table.</P>

    <P>(1) The reduction in applications refused in 1996, 1997 and 1998 is because, prior to October, 1996, the practice was to refuse applications at the initial stage if all the official conditions were not met, whereas since October, 1996 applicants are given an opportunity to comply with these conditions subsequent to the initial application.</P>
    <P>(2) It should be noted that a substantial number of applications, although not withdrawn by the applicant, are either not pursued to conclusion or involve considerable delay on the part of the applicant in meeting official requirements before the application can be granted. For example, at the end of 1998, 271 bodies which submitted applications in that year had not responded to queries raised by Revenue. The processing of a further 87 cases received in 1998 had not been completed by the end of the year. Six of the cases refused in 1998 related to applications received prior to that year.</P>
    <P>(3) Exemptions granted in any one year would include a number of applications received prior to that year. For example, of the 359 exemptions granted in 1998, 193 related to applications received prior to that year.</P>
    <P>(4) The sharp increase in the number of bodies categorised as defunct in 1998 is due to a special project commenced in February of that year to identify charities which were no longer active. Almost all of these bodies became defunct a long time ago. The 1998 figure also includes cases where religious orders wished to have individual local exemptions subsumed in the parent/provinical house exemption.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that separate statistics of unincorporated bodies holding charitable tax exemption are not maintained and that the information requested by the Deputy could be obtained only by the expenditure of an inordinate amount of official time. The number of bodies holding exemption which do not include &ldquo;limited&rdquo; in their title is 4,739. However, some of these may have been permitted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to omit this term from their title under the provisions of section 24 of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a comprehensive application process must be gone through by bodies seeking charitable tax exemptions and stringent conditions apply where exemption is granted. The considerations taken into account in deciding cases and the requirements to be fufilled by applicants are set out in information booklet CHY1 entitled &ldquo;Applying for Relief from Tax on the Income and Property of Charities&rdquo;, a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library. I should mention that in his 1992 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General noted that the charities section of the Revenue Commissioners examined applications for tax exempt status and ensured that the legislative and administrative procedures were complied with before exemption was granted.</P>

As the Deputy may be aware, the information commissioners will decide on the question of disclosure in these cases under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Where exemption is granted a body would qualify for relief from the taxes referred to in the questions where such liability was incurred. However, the Revenue Commissioners do not have information to hand as to which of the bodies in question actually availed of exemption from these taxes and they have advised me that this information could be established only by a detailed examination of the records of the bodies in question.</P>

      <P>A certificate of tax-free allowances, based on the information available to the inspector of taxes, issued to the taxpayer when he took up employment on 29 June 1998. The certificate is effective from that date as the inspector does not have any information about the taxpayer's income in the period from 6 April 1998 to 28 June 1998. The inspector has written to the taxpayer requesting information about his income, including social welfare income if any, during that period. On receipt of this information, a revised certificate of tax-free allowances will be issued to the taxpayer and any refund of tax which may be due will then be made by his employer.</P>

      <P>The Irish authorities have not yet received approval from the EU Commission for the new urban renewal scheme. The latest position is that the Commission has raised a series of queries arising from our initial application. A reply is currently being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> I would stress that this is part of the normal process associated with obtaining EU approval and that the procedure may take some time to complete. Any final decision made by the Commission in this context will be announced at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission has recently drawn up revised guidelines for the examination of tax incentives in the context of State aid for all members states. The recent difficulties in obtaining approval for this and other schemes is as a result of the EU Commission's implementation of these new guidelines and of the fact that due to unprecedented economic growth Ireland as a whole is moving from an area covered by Article 92(3)(a) of the EU Treaty to an area covered by Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty. Article 92(3)(c) allows for a more limited range of tax incentives than Article 92(3)(a) and the Commission has indicated to my Department that it considers double rent relief and rates remission for a 92(3)(c) area as operating aids, in that they lower the taxable income of an enterprise over the ten year period for which these two reliefs apply. The EU commission has also indicated that it is opposed, on State aid grounds, to the granting of operating aids in such areas except for small scale activities or locally based services in areas where physical dereliction is associated with social disadvantage or high unemployment. It is not expected that there will be a problem in regard to the capital allowances. Any delays or difficulties which have arisen are to due Ireland's improved economic position and to developments at EU level of a general nature.</P>

      <P>The allocations approved by the Government for 1999 were set out on budget day. In taking decisions on taxation and spending for 1999, I have aimed for a substantial surplus, in the interest of the prudent management of the economy. Running a budgetary surplus during a period of exceptional growth is entirely appropriate. It reduces the costs of debt servicing thereby releasing resources for more productive use in the future, helps us to meet our obligations under the EU Stability and Growth Pact to keep our budget close to balance or in surplus, and places us in a position to deal with the challenges posed by lower growth and an aging population in the next century.</P>
      <P>The overall provision of funding for services for people with disabilities, within the allocation to the Department of Health and Children decided on by Government, is a matter in the first instance for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. I understand that priorities for allocation of this funding, on a regional basis, for the expanding range of support services for people with disabilities, are decided by health boards in consultation with, among others, voluntary service agencies, including centres for independent living, and service users.</P>

      <P>The setting of official interest rates for the EMU area has been the responsibility of the European Central Bank since 1 January 1999, when third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) began and Ireland and ten other member states adopted the single currency, the euro. The current low level of euro-area official interest rates is obviously a benefit to both business and personal borrowers, but it does also mean that savers and investors receive a lower yield on their investments.</P>
      <P>I have every sympathy for pensioners who depend wholly or partly on investment income and have seen such income decline as a result of falling interest rates. However, it should be remembered that savers and investors will benefit from the low rates of inflation which are expected to accompany EMU by safeguarding the purchasing power of their savings and investments. I would also like to draw attention to the fact that an individual or couple, where one or more is 65 years of age or over, may be entitled to a refund of deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) paid on savings.</P>
      <P>I would also like to mention the following benefits to pensioners living off savings and investments, which I announced at the presentation last December of the 1999 budget. In cases where retired people who derive an income from investments are also in receipt of the contributory old age pension, they will benefit from the pension increases announced in the 1999 budget. The increase for a pensioner couple will be £9 per week, which will bring the weekly payment to a couple both aged over 66 years to £148.90. In addition to the 1999 social welfare package, a special 50 per cent contributory old age pension will be paid to self-employed contributors who were over the age of 56 in April 1988 &ndash; when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced &ndash; and who have at least five years' paid contributions. This measure will provide a significant additional income to all who are eligible for the special pension, including those who derive income from investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above improvements, a key priority of the programme for Government is to increase the personal rate of contributory old age pension to £100 per week. This will represent a <Col N="356" /> further substantial real increase compared with the 1999 payment rates.</P>

      <P>The spouses' and children's pensions schemes in the Civil Service and in other areas of the public service were set up on a contributory basis. Accordingly, each of the schemes was optional for staff serving at the date of introduction. Staff recruited after that date automatically became members of the scheme. The schemes were established on an actuarial basis, with members' contributions being intended to meet one half of the cost, and operate on the insurance principal where all members contribute in order to provide pensions in respect of members who, on death, leave eligible spouses and children. To allow officers who have opted out of the scheme, or their spouses if the officers are already deceased, a further option to join the schemes would therefore undermine the basis of the scheme and would be costly since most take-up would be by the spouses of officers who had already died. It would also lead to pressure to allow existing members to opt out of the scheme.</P>
      <P>While there are no precise figures available on the numbers of civil servants or former civil servants who are married and are not members of the scheme, a recent survey of a number of Government Departments indicated that 85 per cent of pension scheme members where also members of the spouses' and children's scheme.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Civil Service is concerned the issue of another option has been raised by the civil service unions. I would also point out that the Commission on Public Service Pensions was established to carry out a fundamental review of the occupational pension arrangements for public servants. In its interim report the Commission noted that it had received a number of submissions from unions and individuals seeking a further option for non-members to join the spouses' and children's contributory scheme. The commission's final report is due this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 507 and 508 together.</P>
      <P>As of 1 October 1998, there were 762 people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service, representing 2.8 per cent of the total staff. A tabular statement is attached, showing the percentage of staff, by Department with a disability for each of the past three years.</P>
      <P>Information regarding the grades in which people with disabilities are serving is not held centrally. Even if it were, I would be reluctant to publish details by grade, in view of the sensitivity of the data, especially where, in the case of grades with a small number of staff, the information could result in the personal identification of staff with a disability. Likewise the data for Departments are shown in percentage terms rather than numbers.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service, as an employer, is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for people with disabilities, which includes ensuring that people with disabilities, who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire, are not disadvantaged by reason of  having a disability. Since 1994 a code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service has been in place. The code of practice covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation, equipment, safety and evaluation procedures. The implementation of the code of practice is monitored by a committee representative of staff and management. In addition, in the context of the Strategic Management Initiative in the Civil Service, equality issues, including issues relating to the employment of people with disabilities, are being examined by a committee set up specifically for this purpose.</P>
      <P>As you are aware, the policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service is implemented by from time to time holding competitions confined to candidates with a disability, facilitating candidates with a disability when competing in open competitions, not confined to people with a disability and where possible, retaining staff who become disabled after their recruitment.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated, the fact that the number of people with disabilities has dropped below the target of 3 per cent continues to be a cause of concern. Issues arising from the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service are being considered in the context of the Employment Equality Act, 1998. The heads of each Government Department and office have been made fully aware of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3 per cent quota.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the report to which the Deputy refers stated that there is speculation that the role of the National Treasury Management Agency may be subsumed into the Department of Finance because the adoption of the euro has eliminated exchange rate fluctuations between Ireland and the other member states which also adopted the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans to subsume the role and functions of the National Treasury Management Agency into the Department of Finance. It is true that EMU means that the national debt is now overwhelmingly in domestic currency (the euro being the currency of the State and the Irish pound unit being a sub-division of it) and that the benefit of the reduction in foreign exchange risk to the Exchequer is considerable. It should also be appreciated however that, while significant, foreign exchange risk is only one of a number of categories of risk that have to be managed as part of the overall management of the national debt. <Col N="362" /> Other important areas of risk &ndash; which remain to be managed even with the advent of the single currency &ndash; include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operations risk and credit risk.</P>
    <P>At end-1998 the Irish national debt stood at £29.5 billion, some £4.4 million higher than the £25.1 billion level that prevailed at end-1990 when the agency was established. The annual cost of interest payments on the debt amounts to some £2.2 billion, representing approximately 14 per cent of Government net current expenditure. These large amounts, in both absolute and relative terms, highlight the continuing need for the national debt to be managed in as efficient a manner as possible.</P>

      <P>A building contractor is required to register and account for VAT if his turnover exceeds the £40,000 goods registration threshold or the services registration threshold of £20,000 in any 12 month per<Col N="364" /> iod. Most construction work is rated for VAT purposes at 12.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>As regards the recoupment of any VAT by the scouts club, the position is governed by EU law with which Irish law must comply. Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, a wide range of groups engaged in voluntary and social activities are deemed to be exempt for VAT purposes. This means that the bodies involved do not charge VAT on any services they provide, but as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover any of the VAT that they bear on the goods and services, including construction, that they purchase in the course of their activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to take this opportunity to set out some details on the operation of the Freedom of Information Act to date.</P>
      <P>Regarding the scope of the Act, as the Deputy will be aware the Act commenced on 21 April 1998 for Government Departments and offices. Subsequently the local authorities and health boards come within the scope of the Act on 21 October last. The Deputy will also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has recently announced the extension of the Act into the wider health sector over the coming months.</P>
      <P>Regarding usage of the Act provisional figures for the end of 1998 suggest that approximately 3,200 FOI requests have been received by public bodies. Of these approximately 62 per cent were from individuals seeking information about themselves; approximately 18 per cent were from journalists; approximately 14 per cent were seeking business information; and approximately 6 per cent were from Oireachtas Members.</P>
      <P>Figures suggest that 65 per cent of requests were granted in full or in part, 20 per cent refused and the balance were being processed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the level of appeals the Act provides for internal review of initial decisions made by a public body. Internal review must normally be undertaken before an appeal may be made to the Information Commissioner. Of the order of 13 per cent or requests have been the subject of internal review. In general, review at this level has been quite effective. It provides public bodies with an opportunity to monitor the quality of their primary decisions and to identify and correct problems or inconsistencies with their decision making process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act establishes the Office of Information Commissioner to act as the independent review mechanism for FOI. The number of appeals to the Information Commissioner have been quite <Col N="366" /> low. Of the requests made under the Act, of the order of 6 per cent FOI requests have been appealed to the Commissioner. The IC has made approximately 20 findings to date. Over the coming months, the findings of the commissioner will provide a valuable source of guidance as to interpretation and understanding of the various provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Regarding experience to date with the Act it is fair to acknowledge that, in its early days, FOI poses considerable challenges for public bodies. Our experience to date suggest that it is the complex nature of requests rather than the number received which has proved challenging for public bodies. The Act requires public officials to balance carefully the access rights in the Act against public interest considerations and individual's right to privacy. This has proved to be a complex task, particularly where the decision maker is called upon to decide on competing rights which are finely balanced.</P>
    <P>Departments have found that many requesters are willing to enter into dialogue with FOI officers on the scope and nature of the information sought. This results in benefits for everyone.</P>
    <P>Fees charged under the Act to date have generally been minimal.</P>
    <P>Overall, there is considerable interest in and usage by the public of the Act. This trend seems set to continue for the future in line with experience abroad.</P>

      <Quest>if the tax system and levies are used as incentives to get unemployed people back into the workforce; if so, the specific measures in place to achieve this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2003/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government policy programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, states that the  Government parties &ldquo;recognise the need to reduce the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and give people an incentive to take up work&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My last two budgets have been characterised by major changes in the income tax system which I believe has encouraged, and will continue to encourage, unemployed people to return to the workforce. These changes have included exempting the first £100 of a single person's earnings from tax and PRSI; reducing the entry rate of tax to 24 per cent; reducing the levies charge to 2 per cent and increasing the threshold at which they become payable to £216 per week and standard rating personal and PAYE allowances which facilitated significant increases in these allowances in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the broad measures outlined above, I introduced in the 1998 budget a special tax incentive for the long-term unemployed <Col N="367" /> called job assist. This provides a special additional tax allowance in the first year of employment of £3,000 plus £1,000 for each child for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job. The allowance is tapered down over a three year period. Job assist also allows a double tax deduction for employers who employ a long-term unemployed person.</P>
    <P>These tax measures complement the wide range of active labour market policies currently in place and these programmes are administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Such schemes include the back to work allowance scheme, family income supplement, community employment, Jobstart and the training programmes operated by FÁS. The success of the approach adopted is reflected in the continued strong employment growth and the consistent downward trend of the unemployment rate.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the correspondence referred to him by the Department of Agriculture and Food from a person (details supplied) in County Leitrim; if he will review the case; if this person is exempt from income tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first £4,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than five years and in respect of £6,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than seven years. The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
      <P>These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, &ldquo;qualifying lessee&rdquo; specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives. A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife. A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendent. The restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be open to manipulation with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that there are already very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such <Col N="368" /> as by gift or sale. For all these reasons, I do not propose to provide an exemption from income tax from a farm land lease entered into between related persons whether for the purposes of the early retirement scheme or generally.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer has income from a farmer's early retirement pension from the Department of Agriculture and Food, the lease of land to his son and part-time employment. The Commissioners have no record of any correspondence from the taxpayer concerning the lease of land to his son. Given the level of his income, the taxpayer is liable to make annual returns of income to the inspector of taxes under the self-assessment system. The inspector has carried out a review of the taxpayer's income tax liability, including PAYE tax, for 1997-98. The review shows that the taxpayer overpaid £126.28 in that year. A balancing statement and a cheque for £126.28 will be issued to the taxpayer in the next few days.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for reintroducing Ireland's contributions to the enhanced structural adjustment facility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's £31.5 million debt package announced on 16 September last. In the context of this major debt relief package and in view of the progress made under the HIPC initiative and the lessons learnt from the external evaluation of ESAF, I consider  that it is now appropriate for Ireland to honour its proposed contribution to ESAF. Subscription to ESAF is consistent with and should enhance the attainment of Ireland's wider overseas development co-operation objectives.</P>
      <P>Ireland accepts that structural adjustment is a fundamental and unavoidable part of the development process, not only for the developing world but even for the most advanced economies. Our own experience in Ireland during the mid-1980s serves to remind us that the structural adjustment process is difficult and painful. It was this process, however, which laid the foundations for the economic success which we now enjoy.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding our fundamental concerns for good government, sound macro-economic management and the right balance of sectoral and structural adjustment, Ireland has campaigned for some years to have certain aspects of the IMF's ESAF programme modified. The external evaluation of ESAF published last year proposed that the facility should promote deeper ownership of ESAF programmes on the part of the countries affected; incorporate social impact assessments of adjustment programmes; improve participative processes, particularly with the NGO sector; and deepen collaboration with the World Bank.</P>
      <P>The IMF has already taken steps to accommodate these measures in the planning, design and implementation of ESAF programmes. This is a welcome development. It is now up to Ireland and other like minded countries to ensure that these policies are incorporated and deepened in the ESAF process. The Deputy can be assured that I will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the spirit in which the Deputy raises this issue. However, I have no plans at this juncture to publish a register of all successful applications to Government Departments for information sought under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of critical issues argue against publication of such information. First, of the order of <Col N="369" /><Col N="370" /> 50 per cent of FOI applications to date have been from individuals seeking personal information relating to themselves. This proportion is set to rise in the light of the extension of the FOI Act to health boards and local authorities late last year. It is essential to have full regard to the privacy rights of such requesters. Hence publication of their identity or the content of their applications would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Second, and at a broader level it is important to encourage confidence and usage by the public generally in the Act. I would be concerned that the prospect of publication of a register of FOI applications at this stage could deter members of the public from exercising their rights under the Act.</P>

      <P>Designation for urban renewal tax incentive purposes is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government  in the first instance. Designation under the proposed new urban renewal scheme will be on the basis of integrated area plans (IAP's) prepared for priority areas identified by local authorities. An expert advisory panel, established by the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal, Mr. Robert Molloy TD, has assessed the IAP's for the purpose of making recommendations to that Minister in relation to the designation of particular areas. The delay in designating the new urban renewal areas is due to the need to obtain EU Commission approval for the scheme. Discussions are continuing with the Commission in regard to this matter and it is hoped that these will be finalised in due course.</P>

      <Quest>the number of appointments made for elective surgery by each hospital which were cancelled in 1998; the number of persons whose surgery was cancelled who remain on waiting lists; and the specialities and hospitals concerned in respect of such cancellation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 529 and 579 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not routinely collect information on the number of cancellations of elective surgery in each hospital and, therefore, the information requested by the Deputy is not available. My Department has sought information in relation to the number of elective surgery cancellations for the period 1 December, 1998 to 15 January, 1999 which is attached.</P>
      <P>The level of elective activity in the acute hospital system is planned by local management over a twelve month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. This forms a central part of the service planning process which is required of health boards under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. On taking office I changed the system for the allocation of funding under the waiting list initiative to ensure that hospitals were advised of their funding under the initiative at the beginning of the year rather than well into the year as had always been the case before then. This has enabled improved planning of elective activity for the year as agencies can take account, from the outset, of both projected core activity and activity to be performed under the waiting list initiative in the target specialities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that cancellation of elective surgical procedures are viewed in the context of overall levels of activity delivered in the acute hospital sector against agreed service plans for the twelve month period. In this context, it should be noted that the total number of discharges, both in-patient and day-patient, for all hospitals <Col N="376" /> for the first ten months of 1998 was 676,635 which was almost three percent up on the figure of 656,005 for the same period in 1997. It also has to be understood that the unpredictable nature of activity generated by emergency admissions means that cancellations of elective procedures are inevitable from time to time as the system tries to cope with unexpected peaks. As part of the services planning process, it is a matter for agencies to attempt to take account of these peaks and troughs when planning their elective activity levels over a twelve month period.</P>

      <P>The background to this matter is that the then permanent appointee to the Roundstone GMS post vacated the position at the end of August 1998 with a locum subsequently in place for the three month period up to 30 November. Since that time, the Roundstone panel has been served by a neighbouring general practitioner. In August and subsequently, the Western Health Board have gone to considerable efforts to fill the position but without success to date.</P>
      <P>The position was advertised last August in the normal way and ultimately two doctors were offered the position but turned it down. The post was re-advertised in December with five applications received. Three of them withdrew before the interview date on 11 January. The two remaining candidates were general practitioners with existing practices in neighbouring areas who wished to take on the Roundstone panel as an additional practice with the possibility of seeking to recruit an assistant with a view to partnership to meet the increased workload.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a scenario was not in line with the health board's desire to appoint a doctor specifically to service the needs of the panel members in Roundstone. The board is continuing to make efforts to find a suitable person to fill the Round<Col N="378" /> stone post on either a permanent or fixed term contract basis.</P>

      <P>The provision of a comprehensive range of health services, including health services to assist men dealing with mental breakdown and ill health in the County Meath area is the responsibility of the North-Eastern Health Board. Health boards, and in particular the North-Eastern Health Board, recognise the complementary role of voluntary organisations in the provision of support services to those provided by the boards. In these circumstances, the Men on the Move support group may wish to approach the North-Eastern Health Board with a request for funding to assist the organisation in its activities.</P>

When this matter was brought to my attention I asked my officials to meet as a matter of urgency with management and clinical staff at Cork University Hospital to discuss the resolution of these difficulties.</P>
      <P>I have now been advised by the Southern Health Board that the equipment in question is now in service. The health board has also put proposals to me to ensure the maintenance of services for patients undergoing radiotherapy in the future. I am considering these proposals at present and hope to reach a decision on the matter shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 533, 534, 535 and 536 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Services (In-Patient) Regulations 1991, a consultant's private patients must ordinarily be accommodated in private or semi-private beds, while consultant's public patients must ordinarily be accommodated in public beds. However, a patient being admitted to hospital as an emergency admission shall be accommodated in whatever bed is available.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997, a person is liable for a statutory charge unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public hospital services. The current charge of £25 in respect of each day during which a person is maintained up to a maximum of £250, is applicable to both public and private patients. In addition, private and semi-private maintenance charges are applicable to private patients accommodated in designated private beds.</P>
      <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1991 removed the entitlement to combine public and private elements of in-patient care at the same time. The position now is that every patient is entitled to full public hospital services including public accommodation and public consultant care. Alternatively one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Where a patient chooses to be a private patient, then he/she is liable for consultant fees even when, for reasons of lack of availability of a private bed, he/she has to, as an emergency admission, occupy a public bed.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the problem referred to was caused by animals grazing on the protective grass layer on top of the site. Tipperary County Council (North Riding) is the statutory authority dealing with this matter. Council officials are in contact with the local environmental health officers and the Environmental Protection Agency. The latest information available is that the animals were removed from the site by the owner and monitoring and sampling of watercourses in the vicinity of the site is being carried out to ensure thare is no danger to water supplies in the area.</P>

      <P>Arrangements were made in 1997 and 1998 for the purchase of initial stocks of pneumococcal vaccine for administration to general medical service patients with certain medical conditions which placed them in the at-risk category for this disease. The most recent advice of the immunisation committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is that the elderly should now also be categorised as an at-risk group in relation to pneumococcal infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £500,000 has been provided in 1999 to meet the costs of purchasing further stocks of pneumococcal vaccine and of its administration by general practitioners to GMS patients in the at-risk groups. Discussions have commenced with the Irish Medical Organisation with a view to <Col N="382" /> agreeing an appropriate fee for the administration of the vaccine to these patients.</P>

      <P>My Department has no statistics on activity in private hospitals. In relation to public hospitals, data are not readily available in a way which identifies clearly persons undergoing elective operations who occupy private beds. Following is information on the percentage of principal surgical procedures carried out on medical card holders versus non-medical card holders for the years 1994 to 1997 &ndash; the years for which the most complete data are available &ndash; in public hospitals. The table should be interpreted in the light of the fact that the most recent statistics available indicate that 32.4 per cent of the population have a medical card.</P>
      <P>It is emphasised however that the fact that a person is a medical card holder does not necessarily mean that he or she has sought treatment as a public patient. Likewise the fact that a person is not a medical card holder does not necessarily mean that he or she sought treatment as a private patient. Such a person may instead have availed of his or her entitlement to public hospital services.</P>

      <P>The Dental Health Action Plan provides for the development by each health board of a consultant-led orthodontic service. A consultant led service ensures a service of high quality and high service levels.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition. Children are assessed therefore, in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in the Dublin area is the statutory responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board. I understand there is no waiting list for orthodontic treatment for children in Categories I and II. All Category I patients, the category of greatest need, are assessed and treated immediately. A treatment programme for Category II patients is put in place immediately following assessment. The waiting time for assessment for Category II patients is three years and ten months.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group was set up by the health boards to prepare a report and make recommendations on the orthodontic services. The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the Dental Health Action Plan.</P>

      <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services.</P>
      <P>The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, child minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person. All pre-school services should be inspected by mid 1999. Inspections will take place annually thereafter.</P>
    <P>Statistics on notifications and inspections are compiled on an annual basis. The latest information provided to my Department by the health boards indicates that 2,636 notifications have been received nationally. Over half of these facilities have been inspected.</P>
    <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996 are being introduced in a co-operative manner with pre-school providers. Where deficiencies are identified, providers are given a specific period of time in which to make specific improvements provided that the delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. Health boards can bring breaches of the regulations to the attention of the District Court under Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991. To date the Southern Health Board has brought a prosecution against one provider who closed the premises prior to prosecution. A second prosecution is pending in that board's area. The North-Eastern Health Board has reported that they are aware that a number of pre-school service providers have decided to close their service as they are aware that they fall short of the standards required by the regulations. The Midland Health Board reports that one facility closed voluntarily following inspection. Other boards report that pre-school facilities have not been forced to close in their area and they are not aware of pre-school facilities closing because of the requirements of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Health boards provide financial support to pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991 in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement on 2 December 1998, the Minister for Finance announced that capital allowances are being introduced for expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 on the construction, refurbishment and extension of a crèche or nursery. The expenditure can be written off over seven years at 15 per cent per annum for the first six years, and 10 per cent in year seven.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that an expert working group on childcare was established under Partnership 2000. The group under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is examining the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a childcare infrastructure including the financing and resourcing implications of its implementation. The group is due to finalise its report shortly.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the examination of records undertaken by the health boards at my Department's request in relation to the extent to which Trivax three-in-one vaccine from certain lots produced from batch 3741 was used in the period 1968 to 1970 is outlined as follows. It should be noted that the period in question predates the establishment of the health boards and that the extent to which detailed records are available varies considerably as between health boards.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board indicated that none of the lot numbers in question were recorded on any record card.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board indicated that it appeared that no records are available relating to this vacine.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board indicated that it had identified 181 immunisation records relating to children who received vaccine from lot numbers 69684 and 69685.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board indicated that records for this period are unavailable, with the exception of some immunisation records in Cavan which do not hold any of the details requested.</P>
      <P>The North-Western Health Board indicated that there is no record of vaccine from batch 3741 having been used in the Sligo-Leitrim area. The health board also confirmed that it is not possible to give information regarding batch 3741 for the Donegal Community Care Area as it has no records in this regard.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board indicated that no trace was found of any lot numbers from batch 3741.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board indicated that having examined approximately 25 per cent of its immunisation records, the records showed that ten children received vaccine from lot 69684 and 49 children received vaccine from lot 69685. The board is continuing to examine its remaining records and a final response is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board indicated that lot number 69684 had been used in Galway in 1969 and that records indicated three cases where children had received vaccine from this lot. The board's other community care areas have been unable to locate any records relating to the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Deputy's query about adverse reactions to relate to serious adverse reactions caus<Col N="387" /> ing permanent damage to the children concerned. My Department has no information to suggest that any child who received three-in-one vaccine from any of the lots in question suffered serious damage as a result, other than in the case decided in the Supreme Court in 1992, which involved a recipient of vaccine from lot number 69684.</P>
    <P>The health boards' responses to my Department's inquiries are currently being considered with a view to determining what, if any, further action is appropriate in this matter.</P>

      <P>The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed by the Centre for Independent Living. An independent living fund is a means of funding a personal assistance service to enable people with disabilities to live independently within the community.</P>
      <P>The personal assistance service is part of a range of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. My policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
      <P>This Government, in its first eighteen months in office, provided a total of £22.4 million for the maintenance and development of services in the sector including capital developments. Of this, £3 million additional revenue was provided in 1998 specifically for the development of the services, including personal support and assistance services.</P>
      <P>Out of a total of £13.4 million provided this year, £3 million revenue, equalling £6 million on a full year cost basis in the year 2000, is for the development of services. I have no plans at present to introduce an independent living fund, as proposed by the Centre for Independent Living, as a means of funding the personal assistance service. Priorities for the allocation of development funding are decided by the health boards in consultation with the co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector services agencies, including Centres for Independent Living and services users are represented on such committees.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> Some caution should be used in analysing these figures. Health systems deliver very different services in different countries and this is likely to influence the figures despite the fact that the OECD makes every effort to take this into consideration. In addition, the demands of the public vary between countries with, for example, continental systems having to deal with much higher proportions of their populations in older age groups. Also Ireland is only now beginning to catch up with our EU partners in terms of national income and this means that these countries have had greater resources to build up services for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Finally, the OECD in its economic survey of Ireland published in 1997 compiled a special report on the health services. The report noted that there had been major increases in spending on community services and that there had been significant improvements in hospital productivity in recent years. The report concluded that the Irish health system, based on a mixture of public and private care, resulted in good provision of health care at a relatively low cost to the tax payer.</P>

      <QRef>[1526/99]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>A major factor contributing to the increase in demand for acute hospital beds during the winter months in the Eastern Health Board region is the demand for admission as a consequence of increased attendances at accident and emergency departments. To address this problem, I have provided additional funding of £1.65 million this year to enable eastern region hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing these difficulties particularly during periods of peak demand. These initiatives will include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step-down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They will allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment and observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the additional funding is also being used to fund a public education campaign aimed at increasing general awareness regarding the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments with particular emphasis on persuading persons with minor ailments to attend <Col N="391" /> their general practitioner rather than an accident and emergency department in an acute hospital.</P>
    <P>I have also published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and am committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented. The report is one of a number of measures which I have taken to address the question of long waiting lists and waiting times. I have provided a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999. This is a 66 per cent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is two and a half times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government in 1997. The report recommended the implementation of a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work. It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have provided funding in 1999 of £3.83 million for the development of services for older people in the eastern region which will be an important factor in helping to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by patients who could be accommodated in more appropriate convalescent or extended care facilities or discharged home if adequate community supports were available. It will be used, <i>inter alia, </i>to improve the home help service, increase the number of nursing and paramedical staff in the community, provide support for carers, enable a number of new health board convalescent or extended care facilities to open and increase the number of private nursing home places either subvented or contracted by health boards.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of chronic sick in acute hospitals who have completed the acute phase of their illness and who are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs. The task of identifying and securing appropriate alternative care facilities for them is under way and this also will have a significant impact on freeing up acute beds in general hospitals over the coming months.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out in my recent interim letter to the Deputy on this matter, setting out the available data, this Government made available £4 million last month, by way of Supplementary Estimate to address waiting lists for the provision of aids and appliances, including wheelchairs, for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Investigations to date have revealed that a number of persons are on more than one waiting list. However, the co-operative approach between health boards and voluntary agencies being applied to deal with the waiting lists will address this problem. I am confident that this funding will fully address the waiting lists for wheelchairs.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> The number of persons on the waiting list for treatment has fluctuated in the past number of months arising from the implementation of the Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998, which imposed strict controls over the prescribing and dispensing of methadone. As a consequence, a large number of patients who were being treated by general practitioners have had to be accommodated at treatment centres around the Dublin area. In addition, because of the increased availability of treatment locations, which now number 42, the demand for treatment has increased, causing an increase in the waiting list. This increasing demand undoubtedly arises from the greater availability of drug treatment services and in this connection, it is worth noting that the number of patients on the central methadone treatment list now stands at 3,600, which is the highest number ever on the list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

      <P>Cannabis is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. It is also one of the controlled drugs which has been designated for the purposes of section 13 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of the controls provided in this manner are those which, according to the current UN conventions on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, must be applied to substances, such as cannabis and cannabis resin, for which there is no current recognised medical or scientific use. Under these laws, the manufacture, possession, supply, and prescription of the drug are <Col N="395" /> prohibited, except under licence from the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the designation under section 13 of the Act, licences may be granted only for the purpose of research, forensic analysis, or in respect of the use of the drug as an essential intermediate or starting material in an industrial manufacturing process. Licences may also be granted in the case of certain low tetrahydrocannabinol plant varieties of cannabis for the growing of hemp. Furthermore, the Minister must be satisfied in regard to the scientific or medical justification offered in support of the grant of any licence involving any of the designated controlled drug such as cannabis.</P>
    <P>I am aware that claims are being made in respect of cannabis about the possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis and glaucoma. However, these medical claims are not currently supported by the results of recognised medical research.</P>
    <P>If, however, an application were to be made to me for a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, and the orders and regulations made thereunder, which proposed the conduct of research into the therapeutic use of cannabis, in circumstances where the approval of the Irish Medicines Board under the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987 were to be forthcoming and which would be likely to obtain the necessary approval of the appropriate ethical committee under that Act, I would be prepared to give serious consideration to the grant of the required licences(s) under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.</P>

      <P>Health board drug treatment centres do not discriminate against any person in relation to the provision of appropriate treatment and care. On presenting to drug treatment services a person is assessed and provided with the appropriate treatment as quickly as possible. Assessment and access to drug treatment depends on the severity of addiction and other relevant psychiatric/medical problems. In general, priority would be given to pregnant drug misusers, people who are HIV positive and young people who are injecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people who are taken onto drug treatment programmes, because of the nature of drug misuse, have criminal backgrounds. Clinics do not discriminate against such clients, but neither do they offer any preference to people who have been charged or who are facing charges and seek<Col N="396" /> ing treatment. There are particular situations where a patient presenting with a serious court case pending, such as possession or drug dealing, or other serious offence, would not necessarily gain immediate access to detoxification facilities as these places are limited in number, and there would be questions about the person's motivation for choosing such a programme. In such circumstance the person would be put on a waiting list for treatment pending the outcome of their trial before allowing them access to an inpatient detoxification facility.</P>

      <P>It is recognised that the problem of homeless children/young people is most acute in the Eastern Health Board region. In 1998, an average of eight young people per night presented to the social work service operating outside normal officer hours and the Eastern Health Board estimates that 400 young people are out of home in the region each year.</P>
      <P>In general, when homeless children and young people come to the attention of a health board, every effort is made to reunite them with their family or to arrange to have them placed in foster care or residential care as appropriate. Social work support, advice, information and counselling to include counselling for families and individuals is offered.</P>
      <P>Recent developments in the Eastern Health Board include an emergency residential centre for children under 12 years of age opened earlier this month on the grounds of Beaumont Hospital. Agreement has been reached between the Eastern Health Board and the Salvation Army for the provision of a reception centre and six overnight beds for use by the out of hours services. The overnight beds service is now operating. Additional facilities such as a day reception centre providing food, shelter and a gateway to other relevant services and emergency accommodation for boys will be opening in the near future at other locations in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>A forum on youth homelessness has now been established in the Eastern Health Board region with representation from the key voluntary organisations, Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board. It is my intention to launch a series of new initiatives for homeless youth in 1999.

      <P>I have made inquiries of the South-Eastern Health Board in this case. The health board does not hold comprehensive records of batch and lot numbers of vaccine used during the period of this child's vaccination, which predates the establishment of the South-Eastern Health Board. Searches in the Wexford and Waterford areas in 1998 recovered some records indicating lot numbers and batch numbers. However, in neither area was any record found of lot numbers from batch 3741 of Trivax vaccine.</P>
      <P>In order to assist the family in this case the health board continued to make investigations in order to try and locate any information or records which might relate to the individual concerned. The health board has been unable to locate any immunisation records relating to this individual. However copies of some reports and records relating to a hospital stay have been located.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board regrets any apparent delay in contacting the family. The board has assured me that it has recently provided the family with the information it has traced in relation to their son.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy regarding the pattern of attendances in the accident and emergencies departments at Beaumont and the Mater hospitals over the past 12 weeks is listed on the attached table.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of both hospitals regarding the average waiting period for medical attention and the average waiting period for admission to a bed for the same period and I have been furnished with the following information.</P>
      <P>Beaumont Hospital authorities have advised me that the average waiting time for medical attention in the hospital's accident and emergencies department over the last 12 weeks is 3.1 hours, while the average waiting time from time of arrival to admission to a bed is 10.5 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mater Hospital authorities have advised <Col N="398" /> me that the average waiting time for medical attention in the hospital's accident and emergency department over the last 12 weeks varied from immediately to six hours, depending on the pressure of work at the time. They further stated that they are unable to determine the average waiting time from time of arrival to admission to a bed. However, they stated that they record on a weekly basis the average number of patients waiting over six hours for a bed and over the past 12 weeks this averaged out at 16.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, Dublin 14, is closing down its outpatient rehabilitation programme for sex offenders; his views on the recent report of a medical journal that agencies are less willing to see programmes as offering a solution and are looking to punishment rather than treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sexual offenders' programme at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, under the direction of a consultant forensic psychiatrist, was suspended following recent deliberations by the treatment team, which also includes a forensic psychologist and a forensic social worker. The <Col N="399" /> suspension of the programme stemmed from the team's concerns about its continued viability, particularly in relation to decreasing referral rates and the reluctance of past offenders to participate in the programme. I am not aware from my inquiries with the Eastern Health Board of any other reasons why the programme has ceased.</P>
      <P>The programme remains under review and can be restarted if and when the need arises. The experience gained has not been lost to the forensic service and will be incorporated into any new programme, if thought to be worth while and viable.</P>

It therefore overstates the number of posts &ndash; WTE &ndash; as some consultants would not work on a wholetime basis. The information collected in 1979 did not include wholetime equivalence.</P>

    <P>The number of children refers to those born in the calendar year 1996 and who have received the full course of primary immunisations indicated.</P>
    <P>The operation of the primary childhood immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards, who enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service. The objective of the programme is to achieve an uptake level of 9 per cent. My Department has established an immunisation advisory group, which is considering a range of issues concerning the operation of the programme, with a view to maximising uptake amongst the target population. Negotiations have also recently been concluded with representatives of public health nurses, who have a crucial role to play in relation to the operation of the programme. I am confident that, with the recent acceptance by public health nurses of a package of measures aimed at resolving a number of difficulties which they had identified, their full co-operation with the operation of the programme will be forthcoming. It is also intended to put in place appropriate structures at regional and local level to ensure the involvement of all the parties to the operation of the programme in the development of strategies to ensure that the target of a 95 per cent uptake is met.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy in relation to child<Col N="422" /> hood immunisation is guided by advice of the National Immunisation Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and in accordance with international best practice as enunciated by the World Health Organisation. I am aware that from time to time studies have been published which purport to link immunisation with the development of certain diseases or conditions. However, many of the conclusions drawn have not received international support. To date, scientific scrutiny has not revealed a causal link between immunisation and a range of diseases and disabilities which it has been suggested are linked to receipt of vaccines in childhood. The international consensus is that the benefits of immunisation outweigh possible risks, that the incidence of a range of vaccine-preventable diseases has been greatly reduced, with lower morbidity and mortality, and that this development is directly related to the introduction and implementation of effective vaccination programmes.</P>
    <P>The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland's publication &ldquo;Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland&rdquo; contains detailed information for doctors on immunisation, contraindications to the administration of vaccines and their possible side-effects. General practitioners request parents to give informed consent to their children's immunisation and this would include informing them about benefits, possible contraindications and side-effects which may occur. Observation by general practitioners of the advice given on the contraindications to immunisation in individual cases will also help to minimise the incidence of adverse reactions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of children contracting diseases against which they have been immunised, in general, the immunity conferred by immunisation is of the order of 90-95 per cent. Vaccines produce their protective effect by stimulating the immune system in children to protect against the disease in question. Many vaccines require a number of doses in order to achieve adequate immunity. It is therefore important that where the immunisation schedule specifies that a number of doses of a vaccine are required, parents ensure that their children receive the full course of primary immunisation and also the appropriate booster doses as they become older. If a sufficiently high uptake level, 95 per cent or more is achieved in the population, the level of immunity in the whole population is such that the disease cannot spread.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise again that the benefits of immunisation greatly outweigh the risks of possible side-effects and I would urge all parents to ensure that their children are immunised to protect them against a range of potentially serious and preventable childhood diseases.</P>

      <P>In the report of the Mental Hospitals for 1997, the inspector highlighted the poor conditions that exist in some wards located in the old, large, Victorian style hospitals, which are unsuitable for in-patient care of psychiatric patients. However, as these wards are closed and more community based alternative facilities are provided, steady progress is being made towards improving the quality of mental heath care in this country.</P>
      <P>The inspector pointed out in his 1997 report that the rate of progress in upgrading unsatisfactory accommodation or providing alternative community residental accommodation, as well as the development of acute units in general hospitals, has been dictated by the availability of capital funding. In order to address this problem £7 million was provided in capital funds in 1998 which will accelerate the provision of acute psychiatric units in general hospitals. For example, I have included in the capital programme provision for units at Portlaoise, Kilkenny, Sligo, Nenagh, Ennis, St. Vincent's, Elm Park and Beaumont Hospital. Capital funds have also been made available for the provision of additional community based facilities throughout the country including facilities for the older people with mental health problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has, over the past decade, played a crucial role in raising standards in the mental health services in this country. I acknowledge the influence of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and his team in improving the quality of our mental health services and in the promotion of good practice.  The improvements achieved in 1997 are documented in the report and while these improvements are <Col N="424" /> welcome, I fully acknowledge that much remains to be done to improve both physical facilities and services within the mental health sector. It is my intention to continue with the initiatives which I commenced in 1998 so that we improve the rate of progress in the provision of a modern mental health service.</P>

      <P>To date the suicide research group has met on three occasions. The most recent meeting was held on Tuesday, 26 January 1999. The remit of this group, as recommennded by the National Task Force on Suicide, is to review ongoing trends in suicide and para-suicide, to co-ordinate research into suicide and the make appropriate recommedations to the chief executive officer of the health boards.</P>
      <P>The group has identified the areas where it wishes to see progress being made. It is anxious to collate relevant national and international material relating to the incidence of suicide and causes of suicide for the purposes of establishing, as far as possible, a cause and effect relationship between certain factors and suicidal behaviour and advise the chief executive officers, where necessary, on the effectiveness of specific interventions on suicide rates.</P>
      <P>At the second meeting of the group held in the autumn of 1998, the group identified the need to appoint a researcher with support staff to assist the group in its work. I have made available a sum of £50,000 to meet the costs associated with the appointment of research personnel. I understand that the suicide research group will advertise the research posts shortly.</P>

      <P>I have received responses from the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Environment and Local Government following the publication of the National Task Force on Suicide report. An outline of the responses in relation to the implementation of the task force recommendations, in so far as it affects the Departments concerned, is set out below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Department of Education and Science</i>The task force recommendations of concern to the Department relate to the expansion of the psychological and guidance counselling services, relevant training courses for teachers and the <Col N="427" /> further development of programmes of social, personal and health education. Initiatives taken include: the Department produced a report at the end of 1998 recommending the expansion of the National Psychological Service; existing services have put procedures in place to help schools to cope with the aftermath of traumatic events such as suicide; the Department is committed to improving the guidance counselling services in post-primary schools; a pilot phase of a project to provide teaching counsellors in 30 schools has been evaluated and ten more teaching counsellors are being appointed in the current school year; and, programmes of social, personal and health education are being developed for both primary and secondary schools and the promotion of mental health will be central to them.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</i>A working group has been established to review current coroner services. The working group will review the conduct of inquests and the Coroners Act, 1962 in order to facilitate coroners in returning verdicts of suicide, when appropriate. A number of successful initiatives towards addressing drug dependency problem in prisons have commenced, A national steering group was established in 1996 to oversee local suicide awareness groups in prisons. A report has been prepared on their findings and will be published shortly. Prison staff attend courses by the Samaritans on how to deal with traumatic situations and training in recognition of suicidal behaviour is covered in induction programmes for recruits. A new Form 104, proposed and designed by the task force, to be completed by members of the Garda Síochána in order to provide supplementary data relating to medical and social circumstances of persons who commit suicide has been agreed, approved and implemented in Kevin Street Garda station, Dublin. When the form is implemented nationally, an inspector will be appointed in each area to oversee the satisfactory completion of each form, a circular dealing with the issues of safe custody, storage, etc. of licensed firearms has been issued to the Garda Síochána. The issue of suicide has been included in the core programme of in-service training for members of an Garda Síochána for the year 1998-99.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Department of the Environment and Local Government</i>The Department has stated that the traditional approach to housing provision has been the provision of low rise and low density developments. A circular has been issued to local authorities promoting the need for higher residential density in appropriate locations and outlining ways in which county councils use their development plans and planning powers to achieve this. A high quality of design and a good qualify living environment are highlighted as essential in the context of increased residential density. Consultants are to be commissioned to prepare planning guide<Col N="428" /> lines on residential density and expand on advice already given to authorities. Local authorities must have regard to the need for housing accommodation of ten specific categories of persons when carrying out their statutory assessment of housing needs. One of these relates to persons living in overcrowded accommodation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 594 and 597 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland. At present Irish patients requiring this service travel to the UK.</P>
      <P>In terms of advancing the arrangements necessary to establish an Irish based programme, the Mater Hospital has been designated as the surgical site in Ireland for heart and lung transplants. The Mater Hospital will provide this service, in association with other key service providers, in particular St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park which is the major centre for the treatment of adult cystic fibrosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mater Hospital, as a matter of urgency, is co-ordinating and finalising a detailed assessment of the infrastructural and service issues involved in developing the programme in Ireland including <Col N="429" /> the training needs of the staff at the unit. I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to providing the necessary finance and support for the development of a quality transplant programme in Ireland at the earliest date.</P>
    <P>Of more immediate concern to patients awaiting a transplant in the UK is whether the existing level of service can be improved in any way while an Irish based programme is being established. Detailed discussions have been held with four UK centres with a view to establishing a contractual arrangement with one of the centres for the treatment of Irish patients. Intensive negotiations with one of these centres are now under way and I am confident that a contract will be finalised in the coming weeks which will result in a significant improvement in the existing service. One of the improvements which I intend to put in place is the introduction of an Irish based assessment clinic for patients in order to ease the burden on patients and their families who at present require to travel to the UK for assessments.</P>

      <Quest>the position in relation to the 120 staff at the Tallaght hospital whose positions have not been sanctioned by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that staff numbers on the hospital's payroll at 11 October 1998 were 139 wholetime equivalents above approved levels. This number included 40.7 commissioning staff which the hospital anticipated would be released by April 1999. The Department is currently awaiting the hospital's service plan for 1999 which should provide details on the current position and state how the hospital proposes to manage this situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage except that to say that I expect the hospital to comply with relevant labour legislation and best industrial relations practice in accordance with the industrial relations protocol agreed with the trade unions.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he will report on the situation of the 16 to 18 consultants' positions for the Tallaght Hospital; if there is sufficient funding available to sustain these posts in order to guarantee patients' care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1906/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997, the Department signalled that the hospital's priority list of 16 consultant posts would be given sympathetic consideration on a phased basis from 1998 to 2000. This was at a time <Col N="430" /> when it was thought that the new hospital would open in Tallaght in January 1998 rather than June 1998. In the event, the schedule set out by the hospital in June 1997 envisaged all posts being filled by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>Four of the 16 posts have been approved by the Department &ndash; three in June 1997 &ndash; consultant gastroenterologist, consultant vascular surgeon and consultant physician with a special interest in respiratory medicine, and one in December 1997, consultant histopathologist. Funding was made available for these posts in the context of the 1998 and 1999 allocations.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the post of consultant vascular surgeon has not yet been approved for filling by Comhairle na nOspidéal as the Department's sanction was subject to agreement being reached by the hospital and St. James's Hospital on the provision of vascular surgery services at both hospitals. This agreement is still outstanding.</P>
      <P>In line with the Deloitte &amp; Touche report into the hospital, which has been accepted by the board of management of the hospital, it is not acceptable for the board to continue to seek Exchequer funding or to continue to maintain that it must be made available to develop the hospital until such time as it has demonstrated a capacity to create an effective management system for the present profile of the hospital, and operate at net expenditure levels which are accepted as appropriate for the size, nature and circumstances of the hospital, from its new location in Tallaght., no further development can take place at the hospital until the current difficulties are resolved.</P>
      <P>However, on 18 December last I reached agreement with the hospital on a way forward. The implementation of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report will now commence at the hospital and completion of this process will allow for the resumption of the planned phased development of services at the hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The personal assistance service is part of a range of support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. The objective of policy is to develop the range of services as a whole, in <Col N="431" /> line with the recommendations of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities in its report, Towards an Independent Future, and in accordance with funding available for the development of the services. Priorities for the allocation of development funding are decided by each health board in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services on which voluntary agencies, including the Centre for Independent Living, is represented. Of a total of £13.4 million made available for the maintenance and development of these services in 1999, £3 million revenue, equalling £6 million full year cost in the year 2000, is for development.</P>

    <P>The current expenditure figures used are taken from the programme breakdown shown as an appendix to the Department's Vote in the Revised Estimates for the Public Service. This has been the source used when calculating health expenditure as a proportion of national income over the years. The 1999 Revised Estimates are currently being finalised and will be published very shortly. This will provide the definitive 1998 outturn figure and the most up to date 1999 estimate.

      <P>The Eastern Health Board, in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Service, 1993, has responsibility for monitoring ambulance response times and assessing the adequacy of resources available to ambulance bases in relation to the population of the area being served.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the Eastern Health Board employed two additional ambulance personnel for the Maynooth ambulance station. The addition of two staff eliminated the practice of &lsquo;on-call' working by staff at the base and Maynooth ambulance service now provides full 24-hour ambulance cover. Ambulance control staff are trained to apply a system of medical priority despatch ensuring appropriate despatch of ambulances to emergency and/or urgent calls. Emergency ambulance calls are those received from any member of the public when an immediate response is required. Urgent ambulance calls are those received from any medical source. Such calls are usually received from a general practitioner who is in attendance with a patient and who is making an informed decision as to whether or not a time delay can apply to the patient's conveyance to hospital.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is concerned about a particular case involving the North Kildare ambulance service he should, in the first instance, contact the Eastern Health Board which has overall responsibility for providing this service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 620 and 621 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 the health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care, however, it was never intended to meet the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, this Government has provided significant additional resources for the nursing home subventions scheme. More than £17 million was provided for the scheme in the Estimates for 1998. Additional funding of £6.9 million was provided in the Supplementary Estimate for 1998. A further £9 million was allocated to health boards this year to meet, <i>inter alia</i>, increased demand for nursing home subventions, the additional costs arising from increased dependency levels and the change in the regulations which applies from 1 January 1999. This regulation removes the provision which allowed health boards to assess the capacity of adult sons and-or daughters over 21 years of age to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of their parent. The cost of this change alone is estimated at about £2 million per annum. The additional funding provided this year brings the total amount of funding available for the scheme to £33 million.</P>
      <P>The budget allocation for older people includes a sum of £1.45 million which will enable a new 50-bed community nursing unit at St. Clare's, Ballymun, to be opened this year, together with a new 27-bed unit in Clonmel. In addition, the full year costs of contracting an additional 65 nursing home beds is being allocated to the Eastern Health Board, which will help to alleviate the pressure on acute hospital beds in the major general hospitals in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to develop better health and other support services for older people is regarded as a priority by this Government. An indication or our commitment to improving services for older people during our term of office can be seen in the fact that we have doubled the capital allocation to services for older people, from £7 million in 1997 to £14 million in 1998. New community nursing units are under construction at Achill and Killybegs. Another important aspect of the capital programme is to replace old, unsatisfactory accommodation with new, modern <Col N="436" /> facilities and such work has started, or is being planned, at locations such as Birr, Cavan and Enniscorthy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, introduced changes regarding capital allowances for nursing homes in the Finance Act, 1998, to encourage investment in the private nursing home sector.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to include asthma as part of the long-term illness scheme in view of recent comments by a consultant (details supplied) that he believes it is necessary to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2102/99]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses. The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition such as asthma, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card. In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board. With effect from 1 April 1999, the existing drug cost subsidisation and drug refund schemes will be merged into one new drug payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit or individual. No family or individual will have to pay more than £42 in any month on prescribed medicines. Any expenditure on prescribed medication in excess of £42 will be met by the State. To qualify under the present drug cost subsidis<Col N="437" /> ation scheme, patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure. There are no qualifying criteria for this new drug payment scheme and, as such, this scheme is open to everyone.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from illnesses, such as asthma.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that hospital related dental treatments of patients in County Wexford have been cancelled due to lack of day beds in Wexford General Hospital and that no progress has been made on some of these urgent cases which have been referred by the health board dental service to Wexford General Hospital; and if he will ensure that this is remedied in order that these treatments, especially involving extractions under general anaesthetic, can be carried out as soon as possible.</Quest>

        <Col N="439" /> The provision of dental treatment to eligible persons in the Wexford area is the statutory responsibility of the South-Eastern Health Board. I have had inquiries made of the South-Eastern Health Board. I understand that because of demands on day beds in Wexford General Hospital over the past few weeks it was necessary to use the day ward for other purposes and as a consequence the unit was not available for day procedures. The situation in the hospital has improved over the last week and as a consequence day cases, including dental cases, are now being treated again in the hospital.</P>

      <Quest>if, in relation to the database of persons with an intellectual disability, he has been able to project needs in relation to psychologists, speech therapists and other specialist services necessary to support these children during their school going years; the extent to which there is a shortfall in current provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Intellectual Disability Database is used to project overall service needs by providing information on the total number of people with a mental handicap, including children of schoolgoing age, and their main service requirements. The dataset in use at present provides information on a broad range of services as outlined in the following appendix of the codes for main day and residential services. The National Database Committee has now decided to add an additional code to the dataset in respect of multi-disciplinary support services for children and adults. This additional code will be in use from May next, once the 1999 export of data to the national database has been completed. However the demographic information already available from the database is of assistance both to the Department and the health boards in establishing, in general terms, an indication of the future demand for such services for this population group.</P>
      <P>With regard to multi-disciplinary services provided by paramedical grades, following the strike in 1997 by certain paramedical groups, Labour Court Recommendation 15515 recommended the setting up of an expert group to look at issues which the court could not address at the time. In this context, my Department will be participating in a working group to look at issues of manpower planning in the paramedical grades. It is hoped that the group will be in a position to report later this year.</P>

    <P>Responsibility for the provision of routine educational psychological assessments for school children is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science. As the psychological services provided by the Depart<Col N="440" /> ment of Education and Science to primary schools are still in the development stage and are at present limited to a small number of schools, health boards currently provide some services for school children on behalf of the Department of Education and Science. The primary concern, however, of the health funded psychological services is to provide assessment and therapeutic treatment to children, adolescents and their families who present with a wide range of emotional, behavioural and psychological difficulties and developmental delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science proposes, subject to Government approval, to establish a national educational psychological service to provide services for all primary and secondary schools. Fifteen additional psychologists were appointed last year. The development of this service will also assist the health funded psychological services to focus more closely the resources available to them on the areas of assessment and therapeutic treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, successful completion by a student of the three-year nursing registration/diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment as a nurse. Since a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, such a qualification would be an optional post-registration qualification. Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a nursing degree programme at <Col N="444" /> the National University of Ireland, Galway, are, therefore, responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees. I am not in a position to provide funding for these courses.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to note that I have established the representative Nursing Education Forum recommended by the Commission on Nursing to prepare a strategy for moving pre-registration nursing education to a four-year degree programme in time for the intake of nursing students in the year 2002. The forum will be chaired by Dr. Laraine Joyce, Deputy Director of the Office for Health Management. It includes representatives of the schools of nursing, health service providers, third level institutions and An Bord Altranais. A majority of the membership of the forum are members of the nursing profession. The establishment of the forum represents an important step forward in enhancing pre-registration nursing education and training.</P>
      <P>I might also mention that the annual maintenance grant payable to nursing students will be increased by £250 to £3,250 with effect from 1 April next. The value of this grant, which is not subject to a means test, will therefore have been increased by 30 per cent within two years of my coming into office.</P>
      <P>I have also provided funding of £350,000 to An Bord Altranais and to various schools of nursing for a promotional campaign, at both local and national level, aimed at attracting more young people to nursing. I would hope that the recruitment drive that is currently under way, together with the increase in the maintenance grant, will result in an increased level of interest among school leavers in nursing as a career.</P>

      <P>I am very aware of the way in which health service requirements can be affected by population trends, in particular by the ongoing increase in the percentage of older persons and the increase in recent years in the number of births. These population trends are a major consideration in my Department's planning of health service developments generally. In this regard an important exercise which will commence shortly will review services for older people and related hospital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Service plans, which health boards are required to submit annually to me as Minister for Health and Children under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, provide an opportunity to review requirements across the range of health services. Reports of the Directors of Public <Col N="445" /> Health also serve to draw attention to population and other trends with implications for health and health services. Population trends will inevitably be a significant factor which will be taken into account in my Department's review of the national health strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 638 and 641 together.</P>
      <P>Waiting list figures for the quarter ending December 1998 are not yet available. I am fully aware of the difficult situation of patients who are awaiting different surgical procedures. I have taken a series of measures to improve the waiting times for target specialties, including hip replacements. These include the provision of £20 million for the treatment of patients on waiting lists. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the 1998 figure and is 2.5 times higher than the amount allocated for waiting lists in 1997 by the previous Government; the provision of £9 million to services for older people. This will help to free up acute hospital beds, some of which are occupied at present by patients who cannot be accommodated in sub-acute or rehabilitation facilities; the provision of £2 million to selected accident and emergency services. This will again ensure that acute facilities are more easily available for elective work, including treatments for patients on waiting lists; and, the issuing of a new policy circular and guidelines to all relevant agencies regarding the way in which waiting list initiative should be operated in future.</P>

Eight consultant orthodontists have been appointed to health boards and to the cleft lip and palate unit at St. James's Hospital.

These numbers are in accordance with the requirements of the dental health action plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming when the Deputy refers to combined surgical procedures that he is talking about patients requiring a heart and lung transplant as against a lung transplant. I am advised by clinicians at the adult cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's Hospital that since cystic fibrosis patients requiring transplant have mainly a loss of lung function, the tendency now is towards double lung transplantation rather than the more extensive heart and lung transplant. In many cases this is proving to be more effective both in terms of survival rates and better utilisation of donor organs, in that heart-lung blocks donated can now be used by more than one recipient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a specific commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung <Col N="447" /> transplant facility in Ireland. At present Irish patients requiring this service travel to the UK. In terms of advancing the arrangements necessary to establish an Irish based programme, the Mater Hospital has been designated as the surgical site in Ireland for heart and lung transplants. The Mater Hospital will provide this service, in association with other key service providers, in particular St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park which is the major centre for the treatment of adult cystic fibrosis.</P>
    <P>The Mater Hospital, as a matter of urgency, is co-ordinating and finalising a detailed assessment of the infrastructural and service issues involved in developing the programme in Ireland including the training needs of the staff at the unit. I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to providing the necessary finance and support for the development of a quality transplant programme in Ireland at the earliest date.</P>
    <P>Of more immediate concern to patients awaiting a transplant in the UK is whether the existing level of service can be improved in any way while an Irish based programme is being established. Detailed discussions have been held with four UK centres with a view to establishing a contractual arrangement with one of the centres for the treatment of Irish patients. Intensive negotiations with one of these centres are now under way and I am confident that a contract will be finalised in the coming weeks which will result in a significant improvement in the exisiting service. One of the improvements which I intend to put in place is the introduction of an Irish based assessment clinic for patients in order to ease the burden on patients and their families who at present require to travel to the UK for assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Public in-patient waiting lists are maintained by every acute hospital in the country. In its recent policy circular on the operation of the waiting list initiative, my Department has set out specific criteria for inclusion of cases on in-patient waiting lists, as follows: (i) a person should be included on a public in-patient waiting list only if he/she has been certified medically as in need of a specific treatment or procedure which cannot be provided within the normal scheduling arrangements of the hospital for public patients; (ii) a person waiting less than three months for a procedure should not be defined as waiting and should not be included on the waiting list. This applies under the original criteria  introduced at the beginning of the first waiting list initiative in  1993; (iii) a person considered to be unsuitable for immediate treatment should not be defined as waiting for treatment and should not be included on the waiting list; (iv) a person who is on more than one waiting list in different acute hospitals should be retained on the waiting list of only one hospital and not included on the waiting list of the others. In this context a person should be asked if he/she <Col N="449" /> is on a current waiting list elsewhere, at the time of their referral for an in-patient procedure. The relevant consultants in the different hospitals should be asked to agree, in conjunction with the patient and his/her general practitioner, the list on which the patient is to be included; (v) patients should be given the maximum possible notice of the date for their treatment or procedure. Where a person defers a procedure the agency should consider whether or not to reschedule it immediately. The agency may consider it appropriate, depending on the circumstances of the deferral, to require the patient to commence their waiting time anew or no longer to include the patient on a waiting list; (vi) where a person who defers an assessment or review or fails to attend for an assessment or review the agency should apply the provisions set out in (v) above, and; (vii) a person who has received their procedure elsewhere should not be included on the waiting list. Each hospital is required to adhere to these criteria in maintaining and updating its public in-patient waiting list. The importance of validating these lists has been emphasised to agencies, so that an accurate and up-to-date picture of the situation can be available at all times.</P>
      <P>The length of time patients must wait for surgery varies between specialties. My Department's policy circular indicates that agencies should aim for a maximum waiting time of 12 months in target specialties for adults, and for a maximum waiting time of six months in target specialties for children.</P>
      <P>I have set aside a total of £20 million for treatments under the waiting list initiative in 1999, which is aimed at reducing both waiting lists and waiting times during the year. This represents an increase of two-thirds over the figure allocated in 1998 and is 2.5 times higher than the amount provided for waiting lists by the previous Government in 1997. I am confident that this funding, together with the range of initiatives that I have taken this year, will help agencies to move towards achieving the target waiting times for adults and children.</P>

    <P>Contract documents for the Graiguenamanagh sewerage scheme and a revised preliminary report for the Kilmacow sewerage scheme have been received in my Department but have not been approved. These schemes are not included in the 1999 investment programme and come within the terms of my Department's circular letter  L9/98 of 22 October 1998. The circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority list will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>

      <P>The maintenance-improvement of non-national roads in their area, including any proposed realignment of the Firhouse Road, is a matter for South Dublin County Council, to be funded from their own resources, as supplemented by allocations from the Local Government Fund. The initial selection and prioritisation of works/projects in South Dublin <Col N="455" /> to which the various categories of non-national road grants, including EU co-financed grants, should be applied is a matter for South Dublin County Council and I have no role in this matter.</P>
      <P>South Dublin County Council's original applications of 12 October 1998 to my Department for funding in 1999 under the EU co-financed scheme grants included an application for £2.0 million for Firhouse Road, Stage 4. However the council's total proposals envisaged expenditure of £12 million in 1999, which was greatly in excess of the appropriate expediture guideline; the proposals were therefore returned to the council for revision and resubmission. The council's revised proposal comprises one application for £2.5 million for Cookstown/Oldbawn distributor road.</P>
      <P>I intend to announce non-national road grant allocations for 1999, including discretionary grants and EU co-financed grants, in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently announced significant improvements to the terms of the disabled persons grant scheme which is operated by local authorities, effectively increasing the maximum grant by 50 per cent from £8,000 to £12,000. In addition, the grant may now cover up to three-quarters of the cost of the works to private houses, compared to two-thirds previously subject to the maximum amount of the grant which is set by the local authority.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's measures to improve tax administration, the payment of grants, such as the disabled persons grant, by public authorities is conditional on certain details of the contractors C2 or tax clearance certificate being furnished. Therefore, a grant cannot be approved until these details in relation to the builder have been provided to the local authority.</P>

      <P>The costs of establishing strategic policy committees in city and county authorities are primarily a matter for each <Col N="459" /> local authority concerned. Details of expenditure by local authorities in this regard are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Local authority income to meet such costs would, in the main, comprise income from rates, fees and charges from goods and services and general purrpose grants. As a result of increased allocations which I have made from the Local Government (Equalisation) Fund in 1998 and from the Local Government Fund in 1999, local authorities will be greatly assisted in meeting any additional costs arising in establishing the strategic policy committee system.</P>
      <P>Costs incurred in establishing and running the new committees will be balanced both by a streamlining of the committee system in local authorities and, ultimately, by the important benefits and objectives of the system, which include an enhanced policy-making role for elected members and closer involvement in policy formulation of the local community served by the authority.</P>

The Exchequer portion of the allocation was expended in full. Outturn figures for expenditure by each local authority on their 1998 housing programme, based on year end returns by authorities, are being compiled in the Department at present. Local authorities are also making returns on the actual number of new house &ldquo;starts&rdquo;/acquisitions in 1998.

      <P>Arising from a review of the system of expenses for members of local authorities, county councils and county borough corporations were authorised to pay an allowance of up to £4,000 per year to the chair of each strategic policy committee established by the council. Circular LGP 5/98, dated 3 July 1998 refers. The decision to pay an allowance and its amount, subject to a maximum of £4,000, is a matter for determination by the members of each such local authority.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for an allowance for chairpersons of municipal policy committees established in town local authorities. The increases in the expenses allowances for elected members of town local authorities which I introduced in July  1998 cover all meetings of the authority and its committees, including any municipal policy committees, where these are established. The relevant local authorities were advised of this by circular letter LGP 6/98 from my Department in July 1998. Establishment of a municipal policy committee is at the discretion of the town authority concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 672, 701 and 712 together.</P>
      <P>Some 87,000 applicants are at present awaiting driving tests. Of these, approximately 18,000 have been given test appointments and a further 8,500 have indicated that they are not currently available to be tested. The national average waiting period for a driving test is now some 27 weeks. Average waiting periods have not been compiled for all individual test centres due to limitations in the IT systems involved.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 264 of 24 November 1998 my Department is responding to this unsatisfactory situation by increasing the numbers and productivity of its driver testers. Saturday testing has been in place for some time and a further package of productivity measures has also been implemented. The service is also being augmented by the appointment of new driver testers on both a permanent and contract basis.</P>
      <P>Information on the deployment of testers who are assigned to regions and not individual test centres and the numbers on the waiting list at each centre is set out in the following tables.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 674 and 700 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Taxi Forum recommended a continuation of the policy whereby all new taxi licences issued in Dublin are wheelchair accessible. The forum also underlined the need for better marketing and organisation of taxi services, with the focus on consumer needs. It will be principally for the taxi industry to develop specific responses to this requirement, with the assistance as necessary of statutory agencies and other business interests.</P>
      <P>With a view to implementing relevant recommendations of the Dublin Taxi Forum, I am at present considering a number of options for amending the public service vehicles regulations. I consider however that active and customer friendly marketing of services, including those for disabled persons, must be primarily promoted by the service industry itself. My Department is accordingly conducting a series of discussions with taxi and other interests with a view to advancing the recommendations of the Dublin Taxi Forum.</P>

      <Quest>and Local Government if a motorbike licence will be granted to a person (details supplied) in County Sligo in view of the fact that he already had one prior to 1978 and is not covered for a motorbike under the new licence; if a favourable decision will be made in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the person concerned passed a car driving test on 28 April 1978, there is no record of him having undergone a motorcycle test. The <Col N="465" /> issue of driving licences is a matter for individual licensing authorities. I understand however that there is no record in either Leitrim or Sligo licensing authorities of the person concerned having held a driving licence for a motorcycle category at any stage. A licence for a motorcycle issued prior to 1978 would not in any case be renewable at this stage as the period within which a lapsed licence may be renewed, without passing a driving test, is ten years.</P>

      <Quest>and Local Government if the staff required as part of the process to establish strategic policy committees under local authorities will be recruited through open competition with the possibility of outside staff other than existing local authority personnel or if it is intended that existing staff members of local authorities will be redeployed; and the recruitment opportunities which will arise for job applicants with relevant qualifications in the area.</Quest>

      <P>The establishment of stretegic policy committees is one element in the Government's programme of renewing the <Col N="468" /> local government system, which also includes the strengthening of the local authority management and staffing structures, as necessary, to enable local authorities to service the needs of the strategic policy committees and to be in a position to better meet the needs of the communities which they serve.</P>
      <P>Proposals for implementing the Government's policy in relation to this strengthening of local authority management and staffing structures have been the subject of discussions between the Local Government Management Services Board, representing local authority management, and the unions representing local authority administrative and technical staff for some considerable time. The parties to the discussions are meeting in plenary session today and I have asked that they will make every effort to conclude the process at this meeting no matter how long it takes.</P>
      <P>It is intended that a number of the new senior management posts will be filled by designation of existing assistant managers and county engineers. All other posts will be filled by competition. While it is intended that recruitment to the new senior positions will normally be undertaken by the Local Appointments Commission through open competition, what has been proposed in the discussions is that the first fillings of new posts will be by means of confined local competition provided sufficient qualified candidates are available. It is also proposed that consequential vacancies in lower grades arising from these initial appointments will similarly be filled by confined local competition. This process will generate significant opportunities for existing local authority officers, technical and administrative, of various grades, to advance within the local authority system.</P>

      <P>I have taken a number of measures, which I believe will help to faciltate a high turnout at this year's local and European elections. With a view to maximising turnout I announced in 1998 that the local elections will be held in conjunction with the European elections on Friday, 11 June 1999. By giving advance notice of the polling day, greater awareness of the elections has been generated. In addition, a publicity campaign took place in November 1998 advising persons to check the draft 1999/2000 register of electors and highlighting the fact the register will be used for this year's elections. I also intend to publicise the facility of the supplement to the register of electors whereby people can make late applications up to mid-May 1999 to be registered to vote at the June 1999 elections.</P>
      <P>In relation to electoral reform, I established referendum commissions under the Referendum Act, 1998 to provide information to the electorate in respect of the referenda on the Treaty of Amsterdam and the British-Irish Agreement. A review of the electoral system itself is currently being undertaken by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in the context of its examination of the institutions of the State. I would hope that the all-party committee's report, when it is available, will provide a basis for an informed public debate on our electoral system and the scope for reform.</P>

      <P>Under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, a person who is a major producer for the purposes of the regulations must comply with specified requirements, unless they are exempt from these in accordance with article 13 of the regulations. They include requirement to apply to a relevant local authority for registration or renewal of registration, as the case may be, in accordance with article 6(1) of the regulations; prepare and submit to a relevant local authority a plan in accordance with articles 6 and 8 of the regulations; and compile and submit information to a relevant local authority in accordance with article 7 of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Article 21(1) of the regulations requires that the register maintained by a local authority under section 19 of the Waste Management Act, 1996 will contain entries specifying, <i>inter alia</i>, the registration or renewal of registration of a major producer by that local authority. Article 21(2) requires information, including plans, received by a local authority in accordance with articles 6 and 7 of the regulations to be made available at the principal office of the local authority concerned for inspection by any person.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 692, 706 and 738 together.</P>
      <P>The interest rate on local authority fixed rate house purchase is related to the cost of long-term funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced and is fixed for the life of the loan. A fixed interst rate of up to 12.5 per cent applied to loans issued before 1 December 1987. The cost of reducing the interest rates on these loans would be substantial and would have to be borne by either the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or the local authorities.</P>
      <P>However, any person with fixed rate local authority repayments whether for a house purchase loan or under a tenant purchase scheme is free to redeem without penalty and refinance, if necessary, in the private sector at the low rates currently available. This is a very significant concession which would not be available in respect of fixed rate loans from commercial lending agencies.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to point that the maximum house purchase loan in these cases did not exceed £16,000 and the average price paid for a private house bought with these loans generally ranged between £16,000 and £25,000. Amounts paid under tenant pruchase schemes would generally have been much lower.</P>
      <P>Information in relation to the amounts on loan at the various interest rates is currently being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The National Sustainable Development Strategy for Ireland, published by my Department in 1997, states that local authorities should have regard to the concept of sustainability in the elaboration of development plans. The policy provides that, in general, there must be a presumption against urban generated once-off rural housing adjacent to towns. However, there is also recognition of the need for dwellings for certain categories of person whose occupation requires them to be rurally based. However, certain principles should apply to such development including that the site should be suitable for sewage disposal and drainage and have access to a suitable water supply.</P>
      <P>Following on from the review of planning legislation and the consolidated Planning Bill which is currently being drafted, my Department will prepare detailed guidelines for  planning authorities in relation to the development plans. It is my intention that, <i>inter alia,</i> the guidelines will address the issue of urban generated rural housing construction with particular emphasis on the need for sustainable land-use development and the protection of drinking water sources.</P>
      <P>Census 91 Volume 10, Housing, published by the Central Statistics Office in February 1997, shows that within the aggregate rural areas, over 55 per cent of rural households are supplied, either directly or indirectly, from local authority public water supply systems. Some 12 per cent of rural households are supplied from privately sourced group water schemes while the remainder are served by private individual supplies.</P>
      <P>Private supplies are vulnerable to pollution from a variety of sources including poorly sited or inefficient septic tanks or other domestic waste water treatment systems. My Department's rural water programme is specifically targeted at correcting quality deficiencies in private group and individual water supply systems and  I will shortly announce increased levels of funding together with new measures to improve rural drinking water quality in 1999.</P>

    <P>A revised preliminary report for the Ardara sewerage scheme was submitted to my Department in 1994 but has not been approved. Contract documents were approved for Burtonport in 1984. Neither scheme is included in the 1999 water and sewerage services investment programme and come within the terms of my Department's circular letter L9/98 of 22 October 1998. This circular asked each local authority to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in its area and to prepare a prioritised list of projects based on the assessment. The priority lists will be taken into consideration by my Department in framing future water and <Col N="477" /> sewerage services investment programmes under the next National Development Plan 2000-06.</P>

      <P>The majority report of the Committee on the Price of Building Land, commonly referred to as the Kenny report (1973), recommended a scheme under which lands which had been increased in price by local authority works and which were in areas designated by the High Court could be acquired by local authorities and the owners compensated by reference to the existing use value plus 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Building Land Report (1985) did not favour the approach proposed in the Kenny report. With regard to the question of controlling the price of land required for housing and other forms of development, the joint commitee felt that the approach was too narrow. It was unduly concentrated on dealing with land prices, which the joint committee regarded as a symptom rather than a cause. With regard to the question of ensuring that some of the increase in value in land be secured for the benefit of the community, the joint committee felt that the Kenny recommendations would require an amendment to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The joint committee report addressed four main issues namely, the best use of land, the supply and cost of building land, the distribution of gains from increases in land values and the problems with policy on housing, urbanisation and construction. The committee made 28 recommendations. Effect has been given to some of the recommendations, for example, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1990 reformed the compensation provisions of the planning code.</P>
      <P>The Government Action on House Prices published last year adopted a three-pronged approach to increase the supply of serviced land, reduce excessive investor demand and assist lower income house purchasers. My Department is monitoring the impact of these actions. In addition, in the context of the review of the Planning Acts, consideration is being given to ways in which the planning system can support housing supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 721, 722 and 723 together.</P>
      <P>On 21 December 1998, the European Commission notified a reasoned opinion to Ireland in relation to the implementation of Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain projects on the environment in relation to wind farm developments. Ireland has two months to respond to the reasoned opinion.</P>
      <P>The amending directive on the assessment of the environmental effects of projects &ndash; Directive 97/11/EC &ndash; provides specifically that a wind farm project which is likely to have significant effects on the environment must be the subject of an environmental impact assessment. Regulations due to be in force by 14 March 1999 transposing that directive into national law will provide accordingly. The original Council Directive 85/337 does not refer to wind farm projects and my Department considered such projects not to be covered by that directive.</P>
      <P>In 1996, my Department published guidelines on wind farm development to ensure that all relevant issues, including the environmental implecations of such developments, are fully considered in deciding whether or not planning permission should be granted. Planning authorities are advised that environmental information comparable to that required in an environmental impact statement is likely to be necessary to enable them to assess planning applications. Specific guidance is provided in relation to dealing with issues of ecology, archaeology, geology and heritage. Where such issues are relevant, the guidelines state that consultations between the developers, the planning authority, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and the Geological Survey of Ireland should take place at the earliest possible stage. Planning authorities are also advised to have regard to the status of, and obligations arising from, sites and areas which are subject to national or international designations. I am satisfied that the guidelines provide local authorities with a basis for dealing properly with proposals for wind farm developments, pending the making of the forthcoming regulations.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989 a certificate of competency issued by a driving tester is valid for a period of two years. Holders of provisional licences which are valid for two years would normally have to apply for a driving licence within two years of passing a test if they wish to continue to hold a driving licence. In the circumstances I consider that the two year period with which a certificate of competency should be used to obtain a full driving licence is reasonable and I do not intend to extend the period of validity of certificates of competency issued in the past or currently.</P>

      <P>Alternatives to glass milk bottles are widely used throughout the European Community. The question of which packaging materials, products or packaging systems are environmentally preferable is complex, and a definitive assessment of the best practicable environmental option in any specific circumstances would require appropriate life cycle analysis.</P>
      <P>Under Article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, member states may not impede the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies the provisions of the directive, i.e. which is in accordance with the essential requirements specified in Annex II of the directive as to the nature and composition of packaging. These requirements are transposed into Irish legislation by means of the Waste Management (Packaging) (Amendment) Regulations, 1998, which have been brought to the attention of the company concerned.</P>

A wide range of relevant responsibilities and powers of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and <Col N="484" /> of local authorities, is contained in the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>While objectives and targets for the reduction, recovery and recycling of waste are included in the waste policy statement, Changing Our Ways, there is, in addition, a recognition that reversing the growth in waste generation requires determined and ambitious measures from producers and consumers also. These are being pursued, for example, through the development of producer responsibility initiatives, and cleaner production and recycling initiatives supported under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99, as well as through the requirements of integrated pollution control licensing, now extended to all licensable activities. This year I will be developing a significant new environmental awareness campaign which will promote more environmentally sustainable public behaviour, including waste minimisation, reuse and recovery generally.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to questions on 29 April and 4 June 1998, I have established a steering group drawn from a range of relevant agencies and Departments and from the voluntary sector with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>&bull;advise on the consultation process  with the voluntary and community sector (and with relevant statutory agencies) in relation to the White Paper,</P>
      <P>&bull;participate in same (i.e. provide speakers as appropriate),</P>
      <P>&bull;mediate and comment on feedback and advise on issues and directions for the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has met on seven occasions to date. As I also indicated in my reply to the previous question, my intention was that the White Paper be published before the end of 1998. However, at the steering group meeting on 28 May 1998, members of the group expressed concern that this might be too tight a timeframe to allow for adequate consultation with the voluntary and community sector and asked that this timeframe <Col N="489" /> be extended for some three months or so, so as to ensure that time is available for the widest range of voluntary and community groups to be involved in discussions and debate about the forthcoming White Paper. As my primary concern in the preparation of the White Paper is to ensure that it reflects the issues that are of real importance to the sector and that there is genuine consultation in this regard, I have agreed to this request.</P>
    <P>The consultation process with the voluntary and community sector provides for a three phased approach. The first phase provides for information seminars and invites submissions from interested parties. The second phase involves a series of joint regional workshops for the voluntary and community groups and the statutory agencies. The steering group will develop a number of discussion papers reflecting the issues which have been raised in the first two phases of the consultation process. The final phase provides for a national seminar to which people, who have been involved in the initial phases, will be invited to discuss the issues addressed by the steering group in their papers.</P>
    <P>The first phase of the consultation process has now been completed and the second phase is now taking place. Following completion of the consultation process with the voluntary and community sector, it is envisaged that the White Paper will be published during summer 1999.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 746 and 747 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people resident in Ireland, irrespective of nationality, aged 66 years or over, and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. At the end of December 1998, free travel passes had been issued to over 530,000 people at an estimated annual cost of over £32 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was extended in 1995 to cover cross-Border travel only, between Ireland and Northern Ireland. It is available to passholders in Ireland, their spouses or companions in the case of people holding companion passes, and to <Col N="490" /> Northern Ireland concession travel passholders. The scheme does not apply to either sea or air routes between this country and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to concessions currently available to retired people in other member states is not available in my Depaertment. However, it is understood that the Deputy is referring to the question of a European pass for senior citizens which would grant a wide range of concessions including transport across the European Union. At the end of 1997 Age Concern England completed a study of this matter with the support of the EU Commission. It is understood that the EU Commission is considering this report.</P>
    <P>Extending the free travel scheme to all retired citizens of the European Union visiting Ireland would have policy, cost and administrative implications bearing in mind that the scheme is based on spare seating capacity being available on public transport during off-peak hours only.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte estimates that approximately 230,000 EU citizens over the age of 65 visited Ireland in 1997. Of this number, approximately 120,000 did not use a car or private coach during their stay. It is not possible to estimate the take-up of the travel facility by this group and hence the cost but it is clear that it could be significant.</P>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectvies of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the issue of extending free travel concessions to retired EU citizens visiting Ireland will be examined as part of this review process.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs administers a broad range of income support payments for people who are ill and people with disabilities, including the contributory schemes of disability benefit for people who are unfit for work due to illness and invalidity pension for people who are permanently incapable of working; occupational injuries benefits for those who are unfit for work or who are disabled as a result of an accident at work; the means-tested disability allowance (formerly disabled person's maintenance allowance) and blind person's pension schemes for people whose employment capacity is sub<Col N="491" /> stantially restricted because of their disability; and the means-tested supplementary welfare allowance for the people who are incapable of work and not entitled to disability benefit or not permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>In addition, the health boards operate a number of other income support schemes, including the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, domiciliary care allowance, blind welfare allowance and mobility allowance schemes.</P>
      <P>There are now six separate payments being administered by the Department for people who are ill and people with disabilities Accordingly, the potential for the rationalisation of this range of income supports, including the introduction of sickness allowance scheme for people who are temporarily incapable of work but not entitled to disability benefit, will be examined during the year. This examination will have to have regard to the cost of any proposals, commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium to overhaul the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities, and the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, the claim must be in respect of a qualified child, the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and must satisfy a specified means test. In the case of applicants who are in receipt of a short-term payment, such as unemployment benefit, a qualified child is one who is aged between two and 17 years in respect of whom a child dependant allowance is payable. In the case of applicants who are in receipt of a long-term payment, such as widow's pension, a qualified child is one who is aged between two and 22 years and in respect of whom a child dependant allowance is payable.</P>
      <P>The rate of payment depends on the age of the child. A payment of £43 is made in respect of each qualifying child aged between two years and 11 years, while the rate payable in respect of qualifying children aged 12 years or more is £58.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test takes account of any income over and above appropriate rate of widow's and <Col N="492" /> widower's contributory pension plus £5 where the guardian is single, and contributory old age pension plus £5 where the guardian is one of a couple.</P>
    <P>Where the income of a household exceeds these limits, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is not payable.</P>
    <P>Orphan's pension is not a qualifying payment under the terms of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme. The orphan's pension is payable to the guardian and is intended to cover the child's cost of living, including food, clothing and footwear. The payment rate is up to £48.60 per week. In comparison, the allowance paid in respect of dependent children with other social welfare or health board payments, ranges from £13.20 to £17 per week. The higher rate of orphan's pension as compared with the child dependant allowances rate means that the guardian receives an additional income of up to £1,840 per annum in respect of the orphaned child.</P>
    <P>Any change in the scheme to provide for payment of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance to recipients of orphan's pension would have to have regard to other families on lower incomes who do not qualify for such a payment on the grounds of excess means.</P>
    <P>However, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme will be reviewed in 1999 and the suggestion that the scheme be extended to include those orphan's pension will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 750 and 752 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the means test is to ensure that available resources are directed at those most in need. Accordingly, any resources that a claimant may have, whether by way of cash income or investments, is assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As there are over 450,000 people in receipt of social assistance payments it would not be feasible to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments, as this would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlements <Col N="493" /> of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated. For this reason a notional value is ascribed to the capital owned.</P>
    <P>Over the years different methods of assessing the value of capital have been applied to the various social assistance schemes. However, more recently the process of standardising the assessment of capital across the different social assistance schemes has been initiated, so as to achieve greater equity in the system. This standardised assessment method was extended to old age, widow's and widower's (non-contributory) pensioners from October 1997. Under the revised assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, while the formula for assessing capital includes rates of 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent, it is important to note that the effective assessment rates are in fact much lower than those levels.</P>
    <P>In order to determine the effective assessment rates account must be taken of the significant capital disregard of £2,000 provided. In addition, there are other aspects of the means test which, when they interact with the above formula, operate to further reduce the effective assessment rates. For instance, the first £6 of weekly assessable means do not affect entitlement to payment. In the case of a couple, means are taken to be half of the joint means. This results in a couple being able to have double the amount of means that a single pensioner can have.</P>
    <P>The revised method of assessing capital is designed to take account of all of the above factors. Accordingly, old age, widows and widowers pensioners can now have significant amounts of capital and still qualify for payment. For instance, a single old age pensioner can have capital of up to £6,160 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age (non-contributory) pension. A married couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum pension. Furthermore, a single pensioner can have up to £38,348 in capital (£40,428 from June) and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension, while a married couple can have up to £76,696 &ndash; £80,856 from June &ndash; before losing entitlement to the pension.</P>
    <P>The majority of old age pensioners have no capital or have insufficient capital to be assessed for means test purposes. Only a very small minority have capital in excess of £20,000 so in practice the effective rate of assessment of capital is well below 7 per cent in the vast majority of cases.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements are designed to effectively ensure that those with smaller amounts of capital at their disposal receive a greater share of available support than those who have large amounts of capital available to contribute at least partially to meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the interest rates available on investments have fallen in recent times, particularly in the context of the introduction of the <Col N="494" /> euro. In this regard, my Department is reviewing the formula currently used for assessing the value of capital. However, any proposals to further ease the assessment of capital would have financial implications, the actual cost of which would obviously depend on the particular nature of the revised method of assessment chosen. Accordingly, any such proposals would have to be considered in a budgetary context having regard to the available resources and other commitments contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention that the £6 per week increase for elderly pensioners announced in the recent budget will be of benefit to all old age, widow's and widower's pensioners aged 66 and over. This means that all such pensioners will receive the £6 increase in full, even where they are receiving a reduced rate of payment because of the assessment of means.</P>

      <P>The directive primarily deals with the preservations of benefits, disclosure of information and payment of occupational pensions across borders for workers who move from one member state to another.

      <P>Since 1996 my Department has operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support for vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment. The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. The final report from the consultants will be available shortly and the future operation of the scheme will be determined in the light of the outcome of this review.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance is available to people who are living in the State, aged 66 or over, and in receipt of a welfare type payment. It is also available to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. In addition, widows/widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement. At the end of December 1998 over 170,000 people qualified for free telephone rental allowance at an annual cost of some £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for the free telephone rental allowance, the person must be living alone or only with certain excepted people who satisfy this condition. This condition is not, however, applied in <Col N="496" /> the case of persons aged 75 years or over who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the allowance is to provide an element of protection and security in their homes for older and disabled people who are either living alone or with persons who would be unable to summon help in an emergency.</P>
    <P>Over 6,800 people in receipt of disability allowance, who satisfy the qualifying conditions, are in receipt of free telephone rental allowance at an estimated cost of £1.2 million per year.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the additional full year cost of extending the free telephone rental allowance to all people in receipt of disability allowance would be over £7 million. As statistics on the number of wheelchair users in Ireland are not available, I am unable to provide an estimate of the cost of extending the allowance to this group.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance, published in October 1998 by the Department, noted that the role of caring can involve significant isolation and emotional stress for the carer. In recognition of the need for constant contact and support, the 1999 budget introduced a free telephone rental allowance for all carers in receipt of a carer's allowance and for carers of those in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relatives allowance. This measure will come into effect in August 1999 and will benefit approximately 7,800 carers at an annual cost of £1.4 million.</P>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years additional categories of people have been included. A fundamental review of the free schemes, including the free telephone rental allowance scheme, will commence in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>

      <P>It is one of the statutory conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit-assistance that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking suitable work. A deciding officer must be satisfied that each claimant fulfils this requirement before a decision to award a payment can be made.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the rules of entitlement to unemployment payments for part-time workers. Part-time and seasonal workers must be available for and seeking work for the periods in which they are not employed. To qualify for a payment, part-time workers who, for example, work three days per week, must be making efforts to find work for the other days of the week, or full-time employment elsewhere. Similarly, seasonal workers and others, who can be unemployed at regular intervals, are required to be available for and seeking work during these periods.</P>
      <P>Unemployed persons are required to provide information regarding their availability for and their efforts to secure full-time employment.</P>
      <P>A claim for an unemployment payment will not be approved if the deciding officer is not satisfied that the claimant is available for and making reasonable efforts to find suitable employment. In making this determination the deciding officer will have regard to, <i>inter alia, </i>the availability of employment or other suitable opportunities in the area. This is a factor which can change from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A deciding officer may revise his decision if the claimant subsequently demonstrated that he-she satisfies the statutory conditions for receipt of an unemployment payment. Furthermore, if a claimant is not satisfied with a deciding officer's decision regarding availability and efforts to find <Col N="498" /> work, he-she may appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office.</P>

      <P>As a first step towards alleviating the poverty trap associated with the complete withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance once the earnings of the spouse or partners of the social welfare claimant exceeded £60 per week, regulations were introduced in November 1997 to provide for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for people claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, injury benefit and unemployability supplement.</P>
      <P>Under the revised arrangements, where the spouse or partner is earning between £60 and £90, a reduced rate qualified adult allowance continues to be payable. In the 1999 budget, provision has been made to extend the upper limit of the income range from £90 to £105, in order to further enhance the incentive for people to avail of employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>In seeking to alleviate the poverty trap caused by the withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance, priority has been given to those schemes where disincentives to employment are most prevalent.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of an old age (contributory) pension which is not amongst the schemes to which the revised arrangements apply.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, as well as certain incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. At the end of 1998, over 530,000 people qualified for free travel at an annual cost of £32.6 million.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled or blind people.</P>
      <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Time restrictions have been put in place because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening.</P>
      <P>There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART or suburban rail services provided by CIE and private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>An exception to the peak time travel restrictions is made in the case of people in receipt of disability allowance and blind person's pension who attend recognised long-term rehabilitation courses and for certain invalidity pensioners engaged on work experience programmes. These clients are issued with an unrestricted free traval pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
      <P>A small number of representations have been received from groups and individuals regarding the restrictions on the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>The free schemes generally were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free <Col N="500" /> schemes, including the free travel scheme, commencing in March 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most effective and efficient manner. The Deputy's proposal will be examined as part of this review process.</P>

      <P>A person aged 66 or over who is residing alone will qualify for a living alone allowance of £6 per week if she-he is getting a social welfare pension or one of a number of other payments from my Department. The allowance is payable by way of an increase in the person's weekly social welfare payment. At end December 1998, there were almost 108,000 living alone allowances in payment at an annual cost to the Exchequer of £33.584 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the living alone allowance is to compensate for the additional costs which pensioners living on their own have to meet when compared with a couple or a family living together. When a person enters a hospital or similar institution the living alone allowance is discontinued. However, the allowance is restored in full without any loss of payment if the person is dis<Col N="502" /> charged within 13 weeks and resumes living alone. Where the person is discharged from hospital after a stay of more than 13 weeks, the allowance is reinstated from a current date.</P>
    <P>It is considered that the 13 week guideline is reasonable in the context of the basic legal requirement that the person lives alone.</P>

      <P>The cormorant, like all wild birds, is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976. As a protected species, the cormorant cannot be hunted, captured or killed except under licence or permission granted under the Wildlife Act, 1976. The impact of cormorant feeding on vulnerable fish stocks is subject to control under permissions granted by me under section 42 of that Act. These permissions are granted where there is evidence of serious damage to fish stocks. The resultant impact on cormorant populations is minimised by the imposition of restrictions on the permissions granted.</P>
      <P>Bona fide research on the cormorant can also be facilitated by licensing under the Wildlife Act. Some limited studies have been carried out here and in other European countries to examine the impact of the cormorant on fish stocks. However, the results have been inconclusive.</P>

Accordingly, the site is a proposed candidate special area of conservation and as such is required to be given the highest level of protection by the State.</P>
      <P>I am currently concluding a comprehensive review of the protective measures and compensation provisions which I propose to put in place for raised bogs, having consulted widely in the matter. I expect to make a public statement in the matter very soon.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, manages 49 national monument sites in County Meath, many of which are open to the public. I have arranged to have a list of these, together with information on arrangements for public access to them, sent directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Some sites such as Brú na Bóinne and Tara have been improved in recent years and provide high quality visitor facilities with a full guide service, audio visual presentation, toilets and other facilities. As further heritage sites are developed, Dúchas will be expanding its visitor service accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many sites, by nature of their extent or remoteness do not have a staffed visitor service. To assist the public in the appreciation and understanding of these sites interpretative panels are provided. An ongoing programme is in place to provide such panels for all sites in State care in the county and indeed, throughout the rest of the country. Existing signage at heritage sites is being examined countrywide and will be replaced, where necessary, by more visitor friendly signage on a <Col N="505" /> programmed basis. Dúchas has also produced over 300 separate publications for these sites and this number is growing annually. Many of these publications are available in European languages as well as Irish and English. In addition, sites with a guide service are promoted in a variety of ways and this year, under a new initiative, three million colour leaflets will be published and widely distributed both at home and abroad. I have arranged also to have a selection of these publications sent directly to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The following work programmes are either in progress or being planned by Dúchas in County Meath and are being financially assisted by the European Union's Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>

A provision of £650,000 has been made in 1999 for the project. <Col N="506" /> Excavation and removal of spoil from the basin area were completed recently and the extent of repairs necessary to the basin walls is being assessed at present to enable tenders to be invited for that work. Other works scheduled this year include the installation of a new lifting bridge at Blennerville and the relocation of services under the canal. Restoration work to the lock-gates, some minor dredging and the installation of navigation aids will also be necessary and it is expected to complete these additional works in the first half of 2000.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 66 and 67 of 11 Meitheamh 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of water management on the Grand Canal has been operating successfully for some 200 years. The system includes automatic overflows, such as Behan's overflow which, during periods of heavy and persistent precipitation, automatically discharge surplus water and therefore prevents the overtopping of the canal banks. The volume of surplus water discharged at <Col N="507" /> Behan's overflow at any particular time varies but any discharge will obviously contribute to the water level in the Shinkeen Stream. However, the flooding experienced at Hazelhatch in recent years, including the April 1998 flooding, arises from the inability of the Shinkeen Stream to carry the increased volume of water from its catchment area. In the circumstances, resolution of the problem should focus on improving the water carrying capacity of the Shinkeen Stream during flood conditions. Examination of this matter is, however, outside the remit of my Department.</P>
    <P>As to flooding at Castlewarden, Straffan, my Department is not aware of any possible connection between it and the water management system on the Grand Canal.</P>

      <P>Jurisdiction in wards of court matters is vested in the High Court. As the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not <Col N="511" /> open to me to intervene or comment on the conduct of any individual case.</P>
      <P>However, I have had inquiries made in the matter and I understand that the solicitor representing the estate of the deceased in the case has been given a date in April 2000 as the date on which the application for dismissal from wardship can be considered. I understand that this date was assessed on the basis of current workloads and staffing level on the office of wards of court.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, following recent consultations with the unions concerned, three outstanding vacancies in this office are due to be filled shortly. In addition, in response to historic staff shortages in the office which predated my appointment as Minister, I have sought additional staff resources. I have now received sanction from the Minister for Finance for five new posts to tackle that backlog.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these measures will ensure that the necessary steps can now be taken to bring forward the processing of applications to discharge wardships such as that arising in this case.</P>

      <P>I appointed Mr. Peter Finlay and Mr. Eamon Cahill to act as appeal authorities (to hear appeals against the decision to refuse refugee status), replacing Mr. Justice Peter O'Malley who retired from the post in July 1998. They commenced hearing cases in September 1998. The two new appeals authorities have heard 202 substantive appeals to 19 January 1999, decisions have been reached in 88 of these cases and refugee status has been granted in 29 cases. In addition, the appeal authorities have considered (on the papers) 15 appeals against the decision to refuse refugee status (on manifestly unfounded grounds) and eight appeals have been successful and seven were refused.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 793 to 798, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have already informed the House, on a number of occasions, that a review of the licensing laws is currently taking place in my Department arising from the publication of the report on liquor licensing laws by the Sub-Committee on Legislation and Security of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. The interim report of the Competition Authority forms part of that review. It is my intention to bring forward the heads of a Bill for the Government's consideration at the earliest possible opportunity this year.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to update the law generally in the intoxicating liquor area so as to achieve a balanced package of measures. The review of the licensing laws takes into account the many submissions which have been received in response to the invitation, by way of advertisements placed by my Department in the national and local press on 4 August 1998, for comments on the Oireachtas report. I can confirm that my Department is having ongoing discussions with the Garda authorities on relevant issues and that their views are being taken into account.</P>
      <P>I previously indicated to the House that I intended to make regulations to provide for the introduction of a national voluntary age card scheme. I am glad to be able to say that those regulations were made by me on 19 January 1999 and that they will come into effect on 19 April 1999.</P>
      <P>The details of the legislative proposals will be announced in the usual way following their consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>Section 11 of the Children Act, 1997 inserted new sections 26 and 28 into the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964. These amendments are subject to a commencement order which has not yet been made.</P>
      <P>The financial and staffing implications for the Probation and Welfare Service of the implementation of sections 26 and 28 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 is estimated as follows: one assistant principal probation and welfare officer; two senior probation and welfare officers; ten probation and welfare officers and two clerical officers.</P>

      <P>No judge is specifically assigned to hear family law cases in particular. In the Dublin Metropolitan District Court there are two family law courts permanently sitting. Occasionally, when accommodation is available, a third court also sits to hear family law cases. In the Dublin Circuit Court there are also two courts sitting permanently to deal with family law. In the High Court, one court sits four days a week specifically to deal with family law cases and applications. In the Provincial District Court areas family law is dealt with at almost every sitting. In addition special courts are held to deal solely with family law. In relation to the Provincial Circuit Courts, days are assigned by the county registrar to deal with family law.</P>
      <P>I have set out statistics showing the number of family law cases heard in the District Court for the legal years 1996-97 and 1997-98. For the higher courts the tables show statistics for divorce and judicial separation applications received and granted for 1996-97 and 1997-98, and cases still on hands as of 31 July 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 806 and 807 together.</P>
      <P>While it has not been the practice to specify the nationality of persons deported, I can confirm that no deportation orders have issued to nationals of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the period referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the statutory provision on which my power to make deportation orders is based has been held to be unconstitutional by the High Court. However, I hope to be in a position to publish, in a matter of days, draft legislation which will provide a legal basis for deportations. My reply to the Deputy's questions is based on the policy that has been followed up to now and which I will continue to follow if the Oireachtas enacts this draft legislation.</P>
      <P>The question of returning a person who has claimed asylum to their country of origin will only arise when, having had full access to the asylum determination process, that person has not shown that they qualify for refugee status. Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 specifically prohibits the return of a person to a territory where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership or a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
      <P>The political situation in any country of origin, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, is of course a most important factor in the asylum determination process and it is essential that such information is researched and the latest position is known in detail. In this regard my Department obtains information from, <i>inter alia, </i>the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Amnesty International reports, the media and other EU member states.</P>
      <P>A person whose asylum claim has failed an appeal is in any event given a final opportunity to make representations to me as to why he or she should not be returned to his or her country of origin. I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases every consideration will be given to the situation pertaining in the country of origin and I will continue to exercise my discretion under any new legislation in such circumstances as appropriate.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to grant refugee status to persons from Algeria in view of recent reports of human rights abuses in that country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Ireland fully lives up to its international obligations in the asylum area. People entitled under international law to protection are given protection.</P>
      <P>The basic criteria for establishing who is entitled to be granted refugee status is the definition set out at section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996. This provides, <i>inter alia, </i>that a refugee is someone who owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. Each application is considered on its own merit and where the above definition is met the person is granted refugee status.</P>
      <P>The situation in the country of origin of asylum seekers is, of course, a most important factor in the determination process, it is essential that such information is researched in detail. For this purpose, my Department obtains information, from, <i>inter alia, </i>the UNHCR, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Amnesty International reports, the media and other EU member states.</P>
      <P>There are occasions where the criteria for the granting of refugee status are not met but good reasons exist where the person in question should not be returned to his or her country of origin at the particular point in time. In such an instance, consideration is given to allowing the person temporary permission to remain in the State. I will continue to exercise my discretion in such circumstances in keeping with our international reputation and humanitarian traditions in this regard.</P>

    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the indications are that the crime rate for both the Drogheda and Navan Districts is likely to have decreased in 1998.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have also advised that the policing of the areas is constantly reviewed and that there are no plans to alter district boundaries at this point in time. However, the needs of the division will be considered in conjunction with all other divisions throughout the country when resources next become available.</P>

      <Quest>if there has been a change in the clearance system operated by his Department in relation to access to children by part-time workers and students; and, if so, the reason for this change.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex matter and one which is clearly of considerable importance as it relates to the security and safety of children while at the same time, bearing on the privacy rights of individuals.</P>
      <P>At the outset, in order to set matters in context, I wish to emphasise that there has been no change in the arrangements whereby the Garda Síochána carries out clearance checks in respect of full-time prospective employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals. These arrangements are implemented by the Garda Síochána in strict adherence to legal advices received in the matter from the Attorney General. I am aware that there are a large number of other organisations with responsibility for child care, who engage staff, ranging from full-time paid staff to voluntary staff, who are not covered by the arrangements I have already described. To guard against undesirables participating in such activities and as I mentioned in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 356 on 30 June 1998, my Department, together with the Garda authorities, are at an advanced stage of discussion with FÁS, the aim of which is to extend to employees having substantial contact with children in non-residential community employment schemes the same arrangements as apply to prospective employees in the health care area.</P>
      <P>In the interim, in the absence of any formal procedure, a practice has developed whereby employers of prospective employees, not coming under the formal arrangements were, with the written consent of these employees, requesting the Garda for copies of &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; relating to individuals concerned under section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988. This data would have included any personal data held on the Garda criminal records database.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they were recently advised by the Data Protection Commissioner that section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, does not provide for the disclosure of personal data to third parties, irrespective of whether the individuals in question had consented to allow the Garda to respond to the prospective employer and the Garda authorities have, on the advice of the Data Protection Commissioner, ceased to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Data Protection Commissioner has also advised that section 4 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, does not provide for a situation whereby an employer may request that a prospective employee himself should make a request under section 4 of the Act and insist on receiving from the individual concerned a copy of material received on foot of such a request. The Data Protection Commissioner's view is that the essence of data protection law is that it enhances privacy <Col N="528" /> by putting the individual in control of his or her information, and that access sought by an individual on foot of a request to that individual from a prospective employer may be regarded as an unanticipated use of what was intended by the Oireachtas to be a key aid for individuals in protecting their privacy.</P>
    <P>The latest contacts between my Department and the Data Protection Commission have identified possible ways to resolve this difficulty. Urgent consultations in this matter are ongoing between my Department, the Garda authorities and the Data Protection Commissioner with a view to identifying an alternative solution under the legislation. On conclusion of these consultations, I will make a further statement on this matter. I hope to do this very soon.</P>

      <P>I am assuming that the Deputy is referring to section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997. This section allows gardaí, in respect of arrests other than those executed under a warrant, to give evidence by certificate of certain procedural matters, including evidence relating to arrest, charge and caution with the purpose of relieving them from the obligation of attending in person in court to give such evidence orally. The certificate is tendered in court by a Garda court presenter.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that section 6 currently operates in all Garda districts outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area and the following Dublin Metropolitan districts:</P>
      <P>Store Street in relation to Dublin District Court.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A&rdquo; (Kevin Street), &ldquo;L&rdquo; (Ballyfermot) and &ldquo;Q&rdquo; (Lucan) Districts in relation to Kilmainham District Court. &ldquo;N&rdquo; (Bray) District in relation to Bray District Court.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are currently evaluating the operation of section 6 in the districts in question and will consider its expansion when this review is concluded.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda personnel to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities who have informed me that the personnel strength of the Garda station referred to in the Deputy's question as of 5 January 1999 is one garda.</P>
      <P>The station is part of the community policing initiative with neighbourhood watch-community alert schemes operating within the area. It is situated ten miles from the district headquarters which is open 24 hours a day. When the garda in the station in question is not available, a member from the district headquarters opens the station. When the garda in the station is off-duty, calls are attended to by the district headquarters patrol car. A marked patrol van is also available which is utilised by the garda in the station concerned.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; is in operation at the station and is linked to the district headquarters. The present opening hours of the station are 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. &ndash; Monday to Saturday &ndash; with the station remaining closed on Sunday. The personnel strength for the station is augmented from within the district as needs arise.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied with the existing policing arrangements at the station and while is it not intended to increase the permanent personnel strength there at this time, every effort will be taken to ensure as much Garda attention as possible is afforded from existing district and divisional resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 818 to 822, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is responsible for the administration of the criminal legal aid scheme which is provided for under the Crinimal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, and regulations made under it. My Department also has responsibility for civil legal aid which is provided for under the Civil Legal Act, 1995, which is administered by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
      <P>In relation to civil legal aid there are law centres in the counties and cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway, and in counties Kerry and Louth. These law centres are staffed by solicitors who are employees of the board. Consequently no fees are paid in respect of civil legal aid in these counties.</P>
      <P>In relation to the fees paid to solicitors under the criminal legal aid scheme in the counties and cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway and in Counties Kerry and Louth, the position is that records are not kept in a way which would make this information easily available. It could only be compiled by the allocation of scarce staff resources, which would not be warranted and which would inevitably have the effect of delaying other services.</P>
      <P>However a complete list of all payments under the criminal legal aid scheme for the years 1997 and 1998 to all solicitors in the State is enclosed with this answer.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P Just="Center">Total Gross Expenditure (Excluding VAT, RET. TAX and EXPENSES) for solicitors under the legal aid scheme (District and Higher Courts) for the period 1/1/97 to 31/12/97 in payee order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 823 to 825, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The function of the Legal Aid Board is to provide, within its resources and subject to the other provision of the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of that Act. Since the inception of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice in 1979, and more recently the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, a majority of legally aided cases have been in the family law area. The number of such cases where legal aid is sought has increased significantly over the years, reflecting the changing attitudes in Ireland to marriage breakdown and the reform of family law. Nonetheless, of the total number of legally aided cases dealt with by the Legal Aid Board, the percentage which relate to family law has remained relatively constant over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the board's annual report for 1998, about 96 per cent of court cases and 90 per cent of legal advice cases handled by the board's solicitors in that year related to family law matters. While the board gives the necessary degree of priority, where required, to certain classes of actions, for example, child abduction proceddings, domestic violence, Statute of Limitations etc., it does not discriminate against any class of action which conforms to the provisions of the <Col N="553" /> 1995 Act. That there is a preponderance of family law cases is indicative only of the nature of the legal services sought by applicants from the board.</P>
    <P>I am aware that comparision has been made between the relative strengths of the solicitor staff available to the Legal Aid Board and the numbers who are in private practice. It is a concern of mine as Minister with responsibility for the Legal Aid Board that applicants for civil legal aid and advice should have available to them an effective service capable of meeting their needs without undue delay. Waiting times at the law centres are continually reviewed by the board, and where these times, for whatever reasons, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action. In order to combat the increase in waiting times I made additional resources available to the Legal Aid Board in 1998 and again in 1999. I increased the grant-in-aid by 15 per cent in 1998 to £9.615 million, and I am further increasing the allocation this year by 14 per cent to £10.953 million. In addition a further allocation of £1 million is being allocated for legal services for asylum seekers bringing the total allocation to £11.953 million, an increase of 24 per cent over last year. Last July I approved 25 additional posts for the Legal Aid <Col N="554" /> Board. Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts were for law centres. In addition I sanctioned the making permanent of six temporary staff, including three relief solicitors. The board, which has sanction for 89 solicitor posts, currently employs 86 solicitors. A competition is currently under way to fill the remaining three posts and the board is confident it will have its full complement of 89 solicitors in place shortly. I am confident that these allocations should help to alleviate the situation in the law centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1998 I established a national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism. The Committee is a partnership of Government Departments, agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The objective of the committee is to provide an ongoing structure to develop programmes and actions aimed at developing an integrated approach against racism and to advise the Government on matters relating to racism. The committee will also endeavour to promote a more participative and intercultural society which is inclusive of persons such as travellers and minority ethnic groups. Funds of £21,000 were provided by the consultative committee to fund its programme of activities in 1998 and an allocation of £90,000 has been provided in 1999.</P>
      <P>The approach of the consultative committee builds on and develops the initiative begun by the national co-ordinating committee of the European Year Against Racism in 1997. During that year the co-ordinating committee provided a grant of £1,000 to the voluntary group, referred to by the Deputy to fund initiatives against racism. No similar financial assistance was available in 1998. As part of its programme for 1999, the national consultative committee will encourage and support initiatives from organisations and groups, including sports groups, which are involved in appropriate activities to combat racism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other measures which I have taken that will have a positive impact on discouraging racism. For example, the Employment Equality Act 1998, the development of equal status legislation, and action to implement the report of the task force on the travelling community. The Employment Equality Act was enacted in June 1998 and will come into operation this year. The Act outlaws discrimination in the area of employment on nine distinct grounds <Col N="556" /> including race and membership of the travelling community. Similarly, a revised Equal Status Bill is being developed by my Department and will be published this spring. The new Bill will prohibit non-workplace discrimination on a number of grounds including race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin and membership of the travelling community. In June 1998 I set up under the aegis of my Department a committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the report of the task force on the travelling community. The committee will serve as a forum for consultation on traveller issues, including social exclusion and discrimination against travellers, and will monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the task force. In addition, a sum of £300,000 has been allocated for 1999 to fund a communication programme to promote a greater understanding between travellers and the settled community in response to proposals made by the Conference of Religious in Ireland (CORI).</P>

      <P>Due to vacancies in the grade of court stenographer, the criminal courts have found it necessary to utilise the services of stenographers from private agencies, as happened in this instance. Coupled with the pressure of work in the courts, this has resulted in difficulties in the early provision of transcripts.</P>
      <P>At my Department's request the Civil Service Commission has arranged a competition for the recruitment of stenographers and suitably qualified candidates will shortly be called for interview. In the meantime consultations are being held with the private agencies providing a stenography service to the criminal courts with a view to expediting the completion of transcripts.</P>

      <P>Applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons referred to by <Col N="558" /> the Deputy were submitted to this Department in June 1998.</P>
      <P>Two of the applications referred to are applications by a naturalised Irish person in respect of his minor children and these are currently being processed under the relevant statutory provisions.

      <P>The third application referred to is in respect of a person of full age. The various procedures involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation in respect of persons of full age, coupled with the high number of applications being received, are resulting in applications taking in excess of 12 months to complete. It is therefore likely to be the latter half of this year before this case is finalised.</P>

    <P>Until August 1995 both Cork District and Cork Circuit Court offices were located in Washington <Col N="560" /> Street in Cork.

On 18 November 1997, I announced a Government decision in principle to establish on a statutory basis a National Disability Authority &ndash; NDA &ndash; and a disability support service &ndash; DSS. An establishment group was set up to report with detailed proposals on the new authority and support service.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, allows the Garda, in prescribed circumstances, to direct a person to either desist from acting in a particular manner and leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner or both. The Deputy will appreciate that the manner in which this provision is implemented varies depending on the particular nature of the circumstances with which the Garda is confronted. The central consideration is that the person the subject of a direction does not remain a threat to public order of the kind envisaged by the section. I understand that the provision which was extensively debated in the Oireachtas when the legislation was being considered, was drafted on the basis of allowing sufficient flexibility to deal with the wide range of incidents which can arise while at the same time having regard to the rights of individuals.</P>
      <P>In any event, the Garda authorities have not indicated that the operation of the provision in question has given rise to any particular difficulties. The provisions of the 1994 Act are used extensively by the Garda and I believe that it is widely accepted that the legislation has proved invaluable to the Garda in dealing with public order issues.</P>

      <P>Of the Exchequer contribution of £30 million committed to the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, £20 million is being targeted at the local drugs task force areas. The development groups, comprising representatives from the task forces, local authorities and vocational education committees, set up in these areas have prepared integrated facilities and services plans which are currently being assessed by the assessment committee chaired by my Department. I understand that initial recommendations regarding funding to implement the plans are nearing completion and will be submitted to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion for approval shortly.</P>
      <P>Up to £7.2 million of the remaining £10 million has been allocated to a children at risk programme developed by Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. The remaining £2.8 million is earmarked to support strategies and projects aimed at young people at risk of becoming involved in drug misuse in areas outside the local drugs task force areas. In this regard the vocational education committees in Galway, Limerick, south cork city and Waterford have been asked to take the lead in preparing strategies that meet the objective of the fund for submission to the assessment committee by end January 1999. Some £1.8 million has been set aside for this purpose. A further £0.5 million has been earmarked for other large urban areas, where again the vocational education committees, in consultation with relevant bodies, are being asked to identify suitable proposals. Recommendations in relation to the allocation of £0.5 million funding to voluntary organisations with a national and/or regional remit have already been made to the Cabinet committee and a decision is imminent.</P>

The service provides emotional and practical support &ndash; assistance in replacing passports, travel documents, travellers' cheques, etc. &ndash; to tourist victims of crime, following referral by the Garda. No direct financial aid is provided to victims, although benefit-in-kind is provided by the tourism industry.

    <P>The high number of cases for 1998 has been attributed to the success of the awareness campaign undertaken by the TVSS, which included the highlighting of its existence on Garda training courses.</P>

Bord Fáilte has also recently initiated a fund-raising appeal on behalf of the TVSS, which it is undertaking with the Irish Hotel Federation and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, and a number of firms benefiting from tourism have been targeted. I am fully supportive of TVSS and Bord Fáilte's initiative and have also written individually to each of the targeted firms in an effort to strengthen the appeal.</P>

      <P>Loughrea Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre Development Group submitted an application for funding for a swimming pool and leisure centre in February 1998 under the sports capital programme. The group was advised in April 1998 that its application was unsucessful. A new revised sports capital programme was advertised recently, and the closing date for receipt of completed application forms is Friday, 12 February 1999. Meanwhile, the group may also be eligible to submit up to date detailed preliminary proposals, including a feasibility study, through its local authority, for examination by my Department under the separate swimming pool programme. However, I would point out to the Deputy that the total budget of £3 million for 1999 for the construction and refurbishment of swimming pools is fully committed to projects under construction and to projects already approved and on which work is expected to commence shortly.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at this stage to ask the tourism promotional agencies to develop a co-ordinated tourism marketing plan specifically for the west of Ireland or for the marketing of County Kerry as a single unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of individual regions and areas within regions are matters primarily for the local industry representatives working in conjunction with the relevant state bodies. In the case of Kerry, the Government decided on 5 October 1988 to extend Shannon Development's tourism remit to include the north Kerry area. As an integrated development agency for the mid-west region, a part of the agency's role is to initiate <Col N="568" /> and support tourism promotion and development as a key element in the achievement of overall economic growth throughout the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Although established on a different statutory basis, Shannon Development's tourism functions are, in many respects, similar to those of regional tourism organisations, such as Cork-Kerry Tourism, which were established by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Over the last year or so, Bord Fáilte has, at my request, introduced a strong regional emphasis into its promotional activities and programmes, with a view to securing a broader regional distribution of tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Government policy for Irish tourism is being implemented in a co-ordinated and effective manner and that the structures in place are responsive to the requirements of our markets and customers. All such structures must continue to evolve and, while I have no plans at present to alter existing structures, I can assure the Deputy that they are constantly under review and indeed may need to be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the negotiations in the next round of EU Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 852 and 853 together.</P>
      <P>The agreement concerning the staging in Ireland of the 2005 Ryder Cup, which I signed with the PGA European Tour in August last, provides for a payment of £7.5 million to the tour over the eight year period up to 2005. Of this, the Exchequer, through Bord Fáilte, will contribute £3.9 million, and the three co-sponsors the balance.</P>
      <P>While the event itself will undoubtedly contribute significantly to overseas tourism revenues in 2005, the principal benefits of the agreement will flow from the promotional package which is part of the agreement and which extends over eight years.

      <P>The CERT employment survey of the tourism industry 1998 indicated about 4,000 vacancies in the hotel sector, and confirmed that unprecedented levels of expansion in the number of tourism and hospitality businesses was contributing to staff shortages.</P>
      <P>In the light of these findings, increased co-operation in recent times between industry bodies such as the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland and CERT to tackle recruitment and labour shortages is most welcome. Out of this has emerged initiatives such as the National Tourism Careers Roadshow, which CERT, in conjunction with the industry, has taken to almost 40 locations countrywide. This intensive recruitment campaign will alert school leavers, those seeking employment and those wishing to return to the workforce to the benefits of a career in tourism. CERT has also run other programmes, such as media campaigns and school promotions to attract new recruits to the industry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 857 and 858 together.</P>
      <P>On 13 October last year, the Government agreed to the commissioning of a feasibility study for the development of a national stadium, and to the establishment of a stadium steering committee to conduct the feasibility study and to make recommendations based on the findings of the study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steering committee is chaired by Mr. Derek Keogh and includes representatives from major sporting organisations, including the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU, as well as representatives from the private sector and a number of Departments. Through this process, the major sporting organisations, including the FAI, will be <Col N="570" /> in a position to bring their own particular perspectives to bear.</P>
    <P>The committee will be overseeing the preparation of a feasibility study which will address the issues necessary for the Government to make an early decision on the matter. The study will examine a range of issues relevant to the feasibility of developing and operating a stadium, the economic, social and other benefits that can be expected to be derived, and will analyse potential demand for use of the facilities from various sporting, entertainment and other commercial categories. Such analysis will clearly need to take cognisance of all existing and proposed stadia developments, such as the recently announced FAI plans for a £65 million stadium in west Dublin.</P>
    <P>A process to select experts to carry out the study is now under way and it is expected that the finalised study and the steering committee's recommendations on it will be available for consideration by the Government by September 1999.</P>
    <P>Finally, the FAI, in presenting their proposals, has indicated that it intends putting in place arrangements to ensure that its proposed stadium will be self-financing and not reliant on any external grant aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers learn, during their pre-service training, to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those specific difficulties, such as dyslexia, which are accompanied by perceptual deficits. Second level teachers are not, as a rule, trained in the teaching of the basic skills of reading and writing. However, classroom observation as well as the results of assessment tests administered by guidance counsellors and remedial teachers at that level will generally indictate the discrepancy between intellectual potential and academic attainments which indicates the possible existence of specific learning difficulty.</P>
      <P>Those students with specific difficulties who are unable to make sufficient progress in the ordinary classroom may benefit from the additional resource of the remedial education service. This is provided by qualified teaachers, the vast majority of whom have followed a recognised course in remedial education. My Department has supported such courses for many years. Since 1994 there has been a national programme of training for remedial teachers directly funded by the in-career development unit. At present, post-graduate courses for teachers at primary and post-primary levels are held in six centres in universities and in colleges of education. Each year, over 150 primary and post-primary teachers attend these courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is known as a sandwich course consisting of attendance for a total of five weeks of the academic year at the relevant college interspersed with supervised teaching practice in the participants' own schools. Primary and post-primary teachers follow a common core curriculum. The bulk of the syllabus addresses the <Col N="572" /> diagnosis and identification of learning difficulties and appropriate techniques for remediation. Emphasis is placed on the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each student and on the consequent development of individualised remedial programmes. The whole programme therefore assists the participating teachers to help students with all types of learning difficutly, including the type of specific reading difficulty known as dyslexia, by developing their skills of differential diagnosis and appropriate pedagogy.</P>
    <P>In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. The length of the module varies slightly from course to course but, in every case, is supplemented by case studies and by the supervision of the participants' course work on assessment, diagnosis and programme development. Lectures and workshops, delivered by experts in the field, deal with more detailed identification and diagnosis of perceptual deficits and on particualr techniques for dealing with such deficits. Emphasis is laid on the importance of choosing materials which are appropriate to the student's level of ability and interest while being sufficiently easy to read.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of class and subject teachers have expressed interest in developing their skills in relation to specific learning difficulties. Many shorter courses, varying from a day to a week in duration, for such teachers have also been supported financially by my Department. They have been mainly provided through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers. Practical guidelines for the classroom may be provided in the context of the training courses referred to.</P>
    <P>The Education Act, 1998, which will shortly come into force, places a duty on me, which I welcome, to ensure that all persons in the State will have access to a level and quality of education appropriate to their needs. Persons with disabilities or other special educational needs are included in this provision, and there are references to them throughout the Act. The definition of disability used in the Act is wide, and includes any condition that results in a person learning differently from a person without that condition. The definition therefore includes those with specific learning difficulties. It will also be my duty under the Act to plan and co-ordinate the necessary support services for such students and to consult, wherever possible, people with relevant expertise in the area. In addition, each school will be obliged under the Act to state in its school plan its policy in relation to equal access to, and participation in, the school for all students, including those with disabilities, and the measures which the school proposes to take to achieve those objectives. The Act also provides that the composition of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will include persons with experience in the area of special educational needs. The NCCA is to prepare specific recom<Col N="573" /> mendations for me on the early identification of learning disability.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 863, 865, 896 to 900 inclusive, 902, 933, 989, 991, 1000, 1021 and 1023.</P>
      <P>The educational needs of pupils with specific learning disability, including dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of the remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability. There are at present a total of 1,302 remedial teachers serving 2,487 primary schools; 37 of these posts serve 116 primary schools in County Mayo. I recently announced my decision to extend the remedial teacher service to all first and second level schools with effect from September 1999.</P>
      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes where they may receive additional support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Such pupils may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
      <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools and seven special classes dedicated to such children. These special facilities operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any dyslexic support centres in County Mayo. However, I understand that my Department does not currently have any application for the establishment of a special class to cater for such children in the Mayo area. Any such application would receive positive consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department has received representations for funding support from the dyslexic support centre in Limerick. In 1998, my Department allocated a once-off grant of £14,000 to this centre. In 1998 my Department also allocated grant assistance of £38,000 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities, ACLD, to assist in their administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas. However, it is not my intention that my Department should become involved in the ongoing funding of such centres which are developed on a private basis. To the extent that resources become available, the priority focus will be on supporting the development of in-school services for such children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the claim of an incidence of 10 per cent to which Deputy Spring refers. This figure is one of the variety of claims which have been made regarding the incidence of the condition in question. The special education review committee, which examined provision in this area, indicated that estimates of the incidence of <Col N="576" /> specific learning disability are usually within the range 1.4 per cent, depending on the definition adopted.</P>
    <P>I am confident that my decision to extend the remedial teacher service to all schools with effect from September 1999 will lead to a significant improvement in the level of in-school support available to the children in question right across the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 866, 939 and 1014 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, a scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical service.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, £15 per pupil in respect of each service, to a maximum of £15,000 per annum, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional capitation grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management full discretion as to the level and extent of the services to which the grants are to be applied.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP. The priority has been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no caretaking or clerical provision already rather than increase the <i>per capita</i> grant rate of £30 per pupil. In this regard, the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing grant-aid to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional grant assistance to schools for these services. The position of schools that are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the case that examiners were ever in a position to offer favourable treatment to students suffering from specific learning difficulties including dyslexia. For any one subject a common marking scheme is applied to the work of all candidates taking the subject. This is to ensure that all candidates at an examination are treated in a fair and consistent manner and are measured according to a common standard.</P>
      <P>It is the case, however, that my Department fully recognises that where a candidate has a specific learning difficulty this may give rise to difficulties with the presentation and ultimate readability of material presented for examination.</P>
      <P>Traditionally where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material, this has been brought to the attention of the individual examiner. However, in the event of an examiner encountering difficulty in reading the script, the examiner is instructed to send the answerbook to his or her supervising examiner. This is to ensure that notwithstanding any presentation or readability difficulties every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done.</P>
      <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner. The intention is to ensure that problems with readability whether or not brought to the attention of the Department are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change is operational in nature and as I have already explained does not involve any <Col N="583" /> change in the actual marking of examination material submitted by students with specific learning difficulties. Every effort will continue to be made to ensure that full credit is given for work presented and in 1999 examiners will, as in previous years, be required to apply the agreed marking schemes consistently to all candidates in order to ensure equity and fairness.</P>

      <P>Discussions have been held over the last few years with County Cork VEC and the Daughters of Charity order regarding the development of a single post-primary school in the centre. The indications are that the provision of a single school in Dunmanway would have general acceptance locally.</P>
      <P>The main issues remaining to be resolved include the location of the proposed school and the type of management it should have. Ongoing discussions between my Department, the VEC and the order with a view to identifying the most suitable site for the school are at an advanced stage and should be concluded shortly.

      <P>The operation of the current phase of the Breaking the Cycle project is being monitored by my Department's inspectorate and is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre. A key objective of the review process is to establish the appropriateness and effectiveness of the distinct approaches to urban and rural disadvantage which are being tested under the pilot project. The question of extending the project to additional schools will be considered in the light of experience gained in the pilot phase.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently preparing a White Paper on early childhood education which will set out my proposals for the future development of services in this area. The question of future resource allocations to the pre-school area will be addressed in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The teaching counsellor scheme is currently operating on a limited pilot basis in 41 schools. A total of 37 teaching counsellors have been allocated to the schools in question. My Department's inspectorate is closely monitoring the operation of the pilot phase of the scheme. A detailed evaluation of the scheme is currently under way. The question of any further expansion of the scheme will be considered following completion of the evaluation.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of Archbishop McQuaid junior and senior national schools will be fully considered in the context of any expansion of the above schemes which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>The standard maximum period at senior cycle is three years comprising transition year, leaving certificate year one and year two. However, in the case of schools not providing the transition year programme, the standard maximum period at senior cycle is two years. The circumstances in which an individual pupil may repeat a year at second level and the procedures to be followed are also outlined in M2/95.</P>
      <P>Pupils who have sat the leaving certificate examination may be enrolled as recognised pupils to repeat leaving certificate year 2 on payment of the £100 course fee. Pupils whose parents or guardians are the holders of a current medical card or who hold a medical card in their own right are exempt from the payment of this fee. When account is taken of the number of pupils thus exempted, the cost of eliminating the fee for the current year would be £353,600.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 894 and 895 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the student support schemes, the rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which s/he is attending.</P>
      <P>In the case of independent mature students, normal residence is defined as the address of the candidate while in attendance at college. If this address is 15 miles or less from the college which s/he is attending, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable. If the address is more that 15 miles from college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable.</P>
      <P>However, where an independent mature student can produce supporting evidence that s/he is maintaining a residence other than his/her address while attending college, it will be open to the awarding authority to regard that address as the candidate's normal residence. I previously indicated my concern about mature students generally and independent mature students in particular in regard to the rate of grant payable.</P>
      <P>As part of my plans to tackle educational disadvantage at third level, I recently announced total additional funding of £6.9 million to be allocated over the next two years to address such issues. Included in this allocation is provision of £2.4 million to fund an extension of the maintenance grants schemes so that all eligible mature students will now qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements will be provided for in the context of the 1999 student support schemes, which will be available later in the year.</P>

      <Quest>the quantitative methods, if any, for judging the level of need for psychological service nationally and in individual schools which seek a service in view of the fact his Department does not maintain any waiting list of pupils awaiting psychological assessments.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of need nationally for a psychological service was investigated by the planning group for the National Educational Psychological Service and is recorded in its report, which I launched during September of last year. The planning group drew upon the report of the Special Education Review Committee (1993) as well as epidemiological studies carried out in other jurisdictions and on the experience of the existing psychological service. As much available evidence as possible was analysed by a technical working group set up by the planning group. The final estimate made in the report was that 11.2 per cent of the school population might expect to be referred at some stage to the psychological service.</P>
      <P>I am aware that few large scale epidemiological studies have been carried out in this country. An important task of the new National Educational Psychological Service will therefore be the collection of statistics in relation to casework and referral rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to individual schools, the psychological service does not keep waiting lists in the sense of lists of named students who are seen in order. However, an important part of the psychologist's work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for screening, <Col N="591" /> identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. In this way, the psychologist is able to estimate the numbers of students in each school who may need psychological intervention and consequently the amount of time that needs to be spent in each school. In many cases, the psychologist discusses individual students in the light of the school's assessment results with teachers and parents and advises on appropriate remedial strategies. This means that some students can benefit from the psychologist's advice without the need for an individual psychological assessment.</P>

      <P>A subcommittee of the expert group on future skills needs has been established to increase awareness, particularly among school leavers, of the new opportunities emerging in the technology industries established in Ireland. As part of its work, the committee is examining ways in which students' choice of technology careers can be increased.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting in this regard that school leavers' interest in engineering and technology has increased in recent years. As a percentage of first preferences, applications for engineering degrees have risen by one-third since 1992 while applications for engineering and technology diplomas have risen by 50 per cent in the same period.</P>
      <P>The first report of the expert group on future skills needs proposed that study be carried out into the factors affecting student choices at second level, and especially their choice of technology careers. This study forms part of the 1999 work programme of Forfás and that agency will be liaising with my Department in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is also of note that I set up the commission on the points system on 15 October 1997 to examine the existing system of entry to third level education generally. The setting up of the commission met a commitment in the Government's <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium,</i> which included as a key priority the appointment of a high powered group to examine the points system.</P>
      <P>The commission is aiming to report in late spring-early summer 1999.</P>

      <P>The recommendation in the report of the expert group on future skills needs to increase the completion rates in technician courses from 65 per cent to 75 per cent does not include a specific timeframe for this initiative.</P>
      <P>In proposing that completion rates be increased on graduate and technicial courses, the skills group stated that the issues involved are complex. For example, in many cases, students leave a course for positive reasons, for example, to take up employment or apprenticeship, to change to another more suitable course. Each individual has his-her own individual and unique circumstances of early departure from a course. There is no one simple action or initiative that will address this complex issue.</P>
      <P>In May 1998 institutes of technology established a national working group with representatives from each institute to focus on maximising success rates for institute students.</P>
      <P>Three institutes &ndash; Dundalk, Carlow and Tralee &ndash; have recently completed a pilot study on retention rates for first year students. These findings will inform the national working group.</P>
      <P>Institutes of technology have also awarded a research contract to St. Patrick's, Drumcondra, research centre to carry out in-depth analysis of completion-retention rates.</P>
      <P>I am providing £1.5 million over the period 1999-2000 to address the issue of non-completion of courses. I am also actively addressing the provision of science and technology in second level schools, a provision of particular importance in preparing persons for successful participation in technical courses at third level.</P>
      <P>The commission on the points system is also in an important way examining the relationship between second level experience and third level success.</P>
      <P>Institutes of technology have introduced a range of initiatives and support services seeking to improve completion rates. They include induction-orientation programmes, course information services, tutor systems and systems designed for the early identification of at risk first year students.</P>

      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantage status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage scheme was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate a co-ordinator post to the project in question. To the extent that teacher posts become available for allocation, they are primarily focused on addressing needs in the in-school situation. Such allocations can take the form of remedial teachers, resource teachers, concessionary teachers and home-school-community liaison posts. I understand that schools in the partnership area in question are already in receipt of a significant range of special support teachers. However, many other schools are in need of such service and it is necessary that their needs be addressed as a priority.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that this project will be fully considered if co-ordinator posts become available in the future.</P>

      <P>The position is that teaching service given outside the State cannot be reckoned for purposes of a pension under the teachers' superannuation schemes. This country has reciprocal agreements on social security with some other countries, including the United Kingdom, but these agreements do not extend to the area of occupational pensions. Any proposals for transferring occupational pension rights of teachers between countries would have to be considered in a public service-wide context and this is a matter for the Minister for Finance. I am informed that there are no proposals for such transfers at present.</P>
      <P>The teacher's previous membership of the Northern Ireland teachers' superannuation scheme should, of course, entitle the teacher to payment of a pension under the Northern Ireland scheme on reaching the qualifying age defined in the scheme.</P>

As a core element of this, a total of 225 new second level teachers will be appointed this year. These new teachers will enable a move towards the provision of an automatic remedial resource in all schools and home-school-community liaison in all disadvantaged schools. The authorities of second level schools will shortly be notified of the approved teacher allocations, including the allocation for remedial and, where appropriate, home-school-community liaison, for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>

      <P>The objective in making special arrangements at the certificate examination for students, who have either specific learning difficulties or difficulties which arise from a physical or medical condition, is to ensure as far as possible that such candidates are enabled to demonstrate at the examination their level of ability. I am sure the Deputy will agree that, in the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and indeed to ensure the credibility of the examination system the work done by students must ultimately be assessed according to the same strictly objective criteria. This is achieved by having a common marking scheme apply to the work of all candidates in a subject and at the same time by ensuring that every effort is made to ensure that full credit is given in accordance with that marking scheme for the work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> The particular concerns expressed in the information supplied by the Deputy relate to difficulties over presentation, which can arise in work submitted for examination by students with specific learning difficulties, and also the time allowed to complete each test. Traditionally where concerns relating to the presentation of work have been expressed they have been brought to the attention of the individual examiner. This approach is intended to ensure that notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties every effort is made by the examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done. However in the event of the examiner encountering difficulty he or she is instructed to send the answer book to his or her supervising examiner.</P>
    <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner. The intention is to ensure that problems with readability and presentation whether or not brought to the attention of the Department are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged. Every effort will continue to be made to ensure that full credit is given for work presented and in 1999 examiners will, as in previous years, be required to apply the agreed marking schemes consistently to all candidates in order to ensure equity and fairness.</P>

      <P>The process of acquiring repossession of the premises at Howth Road, Clontarf, is now in its final stages. On 14 December 1998 the High Court consented to the surrender by the company of the premises to me as Minister. Formal written notification of the surrender of the property is expected by the Chief State Solicitor from solicitors acting for the official liquidator and I expect to have full vacant possession within a very short time. In order to achieve possession of the property within a reasonable period of time, my Department acting on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor and counsel, agreed to pay the sum of £75,000 to the liquidator in satisfaction of any and all outstanding claims on the property by the company, receiver or liquidator. A sum of £10,300 will be withheld from this amount for the purpose of discharging any outstanding rates on the premises.</P>
      <P>In granting a new lease of the premises my Department will follow normal Government procedures which will involve seeking tenders. While my Department has received approaches from parties interested in the property no formal proposals have been received. Should such proposals be received they would be considered only if submitted as part of the normal tendering process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of representations from County Kildare VEC concerning staffing levels allocated to the committee's scheme and I have met with the VEC in the matter. The allocation of clerical, administrative and maintenance staff in the vocational education sector is made on a scheme wide basis and it is a matter for each vocational education committee to deploy sanctioned staff in the best manner possible to meet the needs of the committee and its schools. Any case for an increase in staffing has to be approached in the context of Government policy <Col N="606" /> on public service numbers and staffing norms in the VEC sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>My Department carried out an examination of the staffing levels in County Kildare VEC in 1995. In addition, an independent consultant evaluated the grading structure of the VEC. Arising from these reports, the clerical staff complement for County Kildare VEC was increased from 15.8 to 17.8 posts and a new senior management grade was created in the committee. This allocation was arrived at on the basis that it compared favourably with other schemes of similar size.</P>
      <P>The recommendation of the independent consultant was that the need for the appointment of an assistant principal officer in the VEC should be reviewed at a later date. My Department has agreed to have this review carried out and my officials will shortly be engaging with the committee and IMPACT, the union which represents the clerical and administrative staff in the VEC sector, concerning the detailed arrangements for this review. The committee is aware of this position.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy and I recently announced a major initiative to tackle education disadvantage at all levels. As part of this initiative, I have arranged for a remedial teacher service to be made available to all primary schools with effect from September 1999. Mainstream schools with pupil teacher ration of below 10:1, and which currently have no service, may apply for a service where they can demonstrate the particular needs of their pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a resource teacher as part of the major new initiative in the special education area, all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs. The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or the group of children involved. The response may take the form of full or part-time special support teaching and/or child care support depending on the number of children involved <Col N="607" /> and the nature of their needs. My Department is considering all applications from schools seeking a support teaching service in the context of these new arrangements. Glenasmole national school should ensure that the school inspector has full information concerning the special educational needs of pupils with a disability.</P>

      <P>I understand from Carlow VEC that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the income limit for the payment of a maintenance grant. However, documentation has been submitted by the applicant regarding a possible change in circumstances which may affect the reckonable income in this case in the future. County Carlow VEC will review the application in April 1999 when it will re-assess the reckonable income for the year ended 5 April 1999.</P>

      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status has already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils. As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted at the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme. The Breaking the Cycle of disadvantage scheme was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage. My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support they need to maximise their potential in the education system. I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses which issued last August, candidates who are entering approved PLC courses for the first time in the 1998/9 school year or who are already in attendance on an approved PLC course are eligible to apply for a maintenance grant. Initially candidates were deemed ineligible for grant assistance if they already held an NCVA level 2 or level 3 qualification, a third level qualification at national certificate, national diploma, degree, postgraduate or equivalent level. Subsequently it was decided, in line with the practice in the third level student support schemes, to allow for progression from NCVA level 2 courses to NCVA level 3 courses or their equivalent. All vocational education committees were notified of this improvement to the scheme. Therefore anyone who has already completed an NCVA level 2 course and is now progressing to pursue a course at, or equivalent to, NCVA level 3 is eligible to apply for grant assistance under the maintenance grants scheme for post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>I understand from City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee that the candidate in question already holds an NCVA level 2 qualification. As the course that the candidate is now pursuing provides progression from NCVA level 2, City of Dublin VEC has reassessed her application, and the student has been awarded a maintenance grant.</P>

      <P>Arrears of pension are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement and Partnership 2000. In order to calculate how much is due under Partnership 2000, it is first necessary to complete the calculation of how much is due under the PCW agreement. The PCW agreement is a complex one and in order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary.</P>
      <P>The pace of the work of payment has, however, been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &ndash; almost 50 per cent higher than in 1996. The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally. The position at this stage is that all retired teachers have received, at minimum, an increase of 3 per cent in pension, backdated to 1 July 1998. With regard to outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full time with a view to making outstanding payments to the retired teachers involved as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I should add that, with a view to reducing the number of queries received and thereby enabling staff to concentrate on payments, my Department has recently supplied secondary teachers with a comprehensive information booklet, in a question and answer format, on the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme. Similar booklets are being prepared for issue to primary teachers and vocational teachers.</P>

      <P>Within the physical education programme the emphasis is on personal survival techniques which are commensurate with the age and ability of the students. While some physical education teachers might offer an intensive course in first aid, which might include instruction on cardio pulmonary resuscitation, such instruction is not part of the recommended programme. First aid programmes, such as those devised by the Red Cross or St. John's Ambulance feature in the transition year programme of many schools. As such I do not consider it necessary that cardio pulmonary resuscitation should be formally introduced into the curriculum in second level schools.</P>

This publication provides detailed comparative information and data on key aspects of the education system in OECD countries including the resources invested in education in a range of countries participating in the project during the period 1990 to 1995. The report notes that in 1995, the Irish proportion of total public expenditure accounted for by education was above average for the OECD countries, and at 13.5 per cent it was the highest in the EU. Further, the Irish proportion of total public expenditure accounted for by primary and secondary education was also above average for the OECD countries, and was the second highest after Spain in the EU.</P>
      <P>In 1996, 17 per cent of Ireland's population was in the five to 14 age group, the highest proportion for the EU member staes where the average was 12.2 per cent. Ireland also has the highest proportion of young people aged 15 to 19 in the EU, and for the OECD as a whole Ireland ranked fourth for this age cohort. To a significant degree this situation presents the Irish education system with a greater challenge in the area of provision than that which confronts most other countries in the survey.</P>
      <P>In broad outline the OECD report demonstrates that the Irish system of education compares favourably with the other OECD countries over a wide range of indicators. Nonetheless, the report demonstrates there is little room for complacency. Major challenges arising out of the growth in participation rates face us as we approach the millennium and the Government will continue to provide for a systematic general improvement in the education system. In this context the Deputy will recognise the significance of the major increases in education spending provided by this Government.</P>

      <Quest>the educational initiatives, if any, undertaken by his Department to address the problem of racism; the amount of funding, if any, his Department has allocated since he came into office to voluntary groups working in this area; and if he will fund an organisation (details supplied) which is already actively involved in these initiatives.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general thrust of my Department's initiatives in addressing the problem of racism is to encourage and promote education which will assist children and young people to understand <Col N="617" /> and value multi-culturalism. The revised curriculum for primary schools, which will be introduced to schools at that level in the near future, includes in its aims the promotion of tolerance and support for diversity in both the school and community. The civic, social and political programme, introduced at the junior cycle of post-primary education, also includes in its aims the encouragement of a positive understanding and acceptance of cultural differences. Increasingly, schools are including respect for diversity as an issue to be addressed in their school planning and provision.</P>
      <P>In 1998, my Department provided £5,500 for to support a research study on aspects of racism among second level students. It is expected that the report on this study will be available shortly. Referring to support for voluntary groups working in this area, the role of my Department generally is to co-operate with other Departments and agencies which may be supporting or engaging in various initiatives. For example, my Department co-operated with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, towards the end of 1997, in providing a resource package entitled &ldquo;Schools and Clubs Against Racism&rdquo; to all schools and youth organisations. This educational package was developed by the National Co-ordinating Committee for European Year Against Racism in association with the National Youth Council of Ireland. In general, my Department does not provide funds directly to voluntary initiatives in this area and has not done so over the past two years but it would be prepared to co-operate with any other funding agency, in any way possible, in support of voluntary initiatives. Any proposals from the group referred to in the question would be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post-primary schools. PE halls are also provided when a major extension to a school which does not have such a facility is being built. In addition, my Department has a programme for providing PE halls as stand-alone projects at post-primary schools which do not already have this facility. There are a number of these projects in architectural planning at present and a number have also proceeded to construction.</P>
      <P>The question of providing physical education facilities at Mullingar community college can only be considered in the context of capital available for post-primary building purposes generally. Because of the demand for accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to state when a gymnasium will be provided in this particular case. However, I can assure the Deputy that this application will continue to be reviewed in light of available resources and competing priorities.</P>

It is the policy of my Department not to divulge information in relation to costings in advance of tendering as to do so may compromise the tendering procedure. I would, however, point out that the provision of almost £60 million for post-primary school build<Col N="620" /> ing projects in this year's Estimates, in comparison with £30 million in the 1997 budget, will enable me to proceed with a significantly increased number of projects.</P>

      <P>I set up the Commission on the Points System on 15 October 1997 to examine the existing system of entry to third level education generally. The setting up of the commission met a commitment in the Government's Action Programme <Col N="622" /> for the Millennium, which included as a key priority the appointment of a high powered group to examine the points system. An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday, 9 November 1998, included some information that has been made available to the commission concerning the number of places on high points healthcare courses given to first-time leaving certificate applicants and applicants with more than one leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>I understand that the information was prepared on a confidential basis by the CAO and was given to the commission to help the commission in its deliberations. It shows that in relation to entrants in 1998, 13.3 per cent of all applicants with a leaving certificate for a higher education place had repeated the leaving certificate at least once and yet 31.6 per cent of those leaving certificate applicants who accepted places on high points health care courses had repeated the leaving certificate. The commission issued a consultative process background document in early September 1998, which analyses the submissions made and outlines the research undertaken on behalf of the commission as well as examining international experience. Following this the commission held a series of consultative seminars across the country later in the autumn and the commission is now aiming to report in late spring/early summer 1999.</P>

      <P>The student in question currently attends school for 12 hours per week. I understand that it was considered by the professionals dealing with this child that he was only able to cope with this level of attendance. However, the question of increasing his level of attendance with a view to eventual full-time attendance at the school is being reviewed at present. My Department has received a request to provide a full-time special needs assistant for this pupil. This matter is being considered in the context of the current review. I can assure the Deputies that my Department will sanction a full-time special needs assistant for this student if deemed necessary following the review.</P>

      <P>Each primary school receives annually a devolved capital grant of £2,000 plus £9 per pupil to enable it to carry out minor capital improvements to its buildings and facilities. Since I came into office I have increased the capitation grant by 33 per cent. The standard rate has been increased from £45 to £60 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £3,600 is now payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to staffing, the Deputy will be aware of my particular commitment to one teacher schools. First, with effect from September 1998, I reduced the appointment figure for a second teaching post from 25 pupils to 18 pupils. This resulted in 25 schools gaining a second teaching post for the current school year. Second, the minimum enrolment needed to retain a second teaching post has been reduced from 23 to 18, with the <Col N="625" /> result that 28 schools are continuing to operate as two teacher units in the current school year. Third, I allowed a further 14 schools whose enrolments had fallen below 18 pupils to retain their second teacher for the current school year.</P>
    <P>In the current school year, therefore, a total of 67 schools are operating as two teacher units as a direct consequence of my supportive initiatives for one teacher schools. At present there are 56 one teacher schools which have an enrolment of ten or more pupils. I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to these remaining one teacher schools as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case put forward by the school in question in support of its application for computer equipment and an additional teacher to cater for children with special needs. I recently announced a range of measures to tackle educational disadvantage at all levels. The measures in question include a commitment to provide a remedial teacher service to all primary schools with effect from September 1999; an allocation of an additional £400,000 in each of the next two years to fund the purchase of special equipment, including computers, for children with special educational needs and a commitment that all children assessed as having a special educational need will have an automatic entitlement to a response to their need. The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved. The response may take the form of full-time or part-time resource teacher support or child care support, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs. The process of responding to special needs cases under these new developments has already commenced.</P>
      <P>The case put forward by Pope John Paul II school is currently being considered. I understand that a member of my Department's inspectorate will be visiting the school this week to discuss their particular needs.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student suppport schemes, a candidate's reckonable income for the purpose of the award of a grant is the candidate's gross income from all sources and that of his-her parents or guardians, where applicable. Entitlement to a grant operates on a graduated basis. In order to qualify for a grant a candidate's reckonable income must be below the relevant income limit, which varies for the level of grant and in relation to the number of <Col N="630" /> dependent children in the family. Different limits apply where there are less than four dependent children, between four and seven dependent children, and eight or more dependent children. Furthermore, where there are two or more children attending full-time third level education or other specified courses, the relevant income limits are increased by £2,060 where there are two such children, £4,120 for three children and so on, by increments of £2,060.</P>
      <P>I understand from Meath County Council, that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the income limit for the payment of a maintenance grant. Based on the details of reckonable income supplied, the student in question would qualify for a fee only grant which, in this case, would cover the registration fee of £260. This will be paid by Meath County Council on receipt of the completed acceptance form. If any aspect of the candidate's reckonable income can be considered as a once-off payment and not likely to recur, then the candidate should contact Meath County Council with proof of same, in order to have the application reassessed.</P>

      <P>Capitation funding is intended to contribute towards the general operating costs, light, heating, etc., of primary schools, including special schools. The presence of special needs children in integrated settings in ordinary schools will not materially affect these general operating costs. The special capitation rates applicable to children attending special schools and special classes recognise the presence of smaller numbers of pupils per class and the need for a compensatory increase in funding per pupil to enable the schools to meet their general operating costs.</P>
      <P>Children with special needs attending ordinary schools may require specialised materials and equipment to assist them in the integrated setting. A separate fund exists to meet such material and equipment needs. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the fund in question is being increased by £400,000 in 1999 and 2000 to cater for the needs of the children in question. I will keep this area under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> The level of resource teaching support and-or child care support made available in any individual special needs case will be determined by a number of factors, including recommendations contained in psychological assessment reports and other specialist reports; the nature and degree of disability involved; the level of academic attainment of the particular child; the resources currently available to the school to address special needs and the care requirements of the pupil.</P>
    <P>My Department's inspectorate will review all documentation supplied by schools to support their applications for additional resources and will recommend a level of resource teaching support and-or child care support, having regard to all the above factors. My Department's special education section will sanction the support services to meet the assessed level of need. My Department will consider any appeal which may arise as a result of resource allocations made under the above arrangements. Any such appeal will be considered on the merits of the individual case involved.</P>
    <P>A draft circular and an information note are currently being finalised in my Department and it is hoped that these will issue to all schools before the end of February 1999. These documents will contain information for schools on how to apply for appropriate resource teaching and-or child care support for pupils with special educational needs arising from disabilities.</P>

      <P>The need nationally for backup for students with special educational needs by psy<Col N="633" /> chologists was one of the issues investigated by the planning group for the National Educational Psychological Service whose report was published during September of last year. The planning group used estimates from the Report of the Special Education Review Committee, 1993, data provided by the Department of Health and Children and the findings from epidemiological studies carried out in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The new National Educational Psychological Service will work in close collaboration with the psychological services provided by the health boards and by those voluntary agencies which specialise in providing support for certain categories of special need. Together, they will collect information as to how much in the way of psychological support is needed by students with special educational needs. There is a commitment in the report of the planning group to giving priority for students in this category. These is also provision for continuous review and for a detailed report, at the end of the initial five year period, of the demand for services.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post-primary schools.

It was also decided that an additional primary school would be required in Naas. A suitable location has been identified for this school and a new buiilding will be provided as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of providing a permanent extension to the Sallins school is under consideration and my Department will be discussing the matter with the school management in the near future. In addition, an application for an extension to Caragh primary school is being processed at present.</P>
    <P>At second level, building projects have been approved for all three post-primary schools and they are being progressed at present. You will appreciate that a rapidly expanding area such as the Naas catchment area will need to be kept under regular review to ensure that there is no shortfall in pupil places. Accordingly, the area will continue to be monitored by my Department on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>Stage 3, developed sketch scheme, of architectural planning is due to be submitted by the school authorities shortly. Once this submission has been examined and if found satisfactory by the building unit in my Department, this project will proceed to stage 4, detailed design, of architectural planning. At this stage, I am not in a position to say when construction will commence. I would, however, point out that the provision of almost £60 million for post primary school building projects in this year's estimates, in comparison with £30 million in the 1997 budget, will enable me to proceed with a significantly increased number of projects.</P>
